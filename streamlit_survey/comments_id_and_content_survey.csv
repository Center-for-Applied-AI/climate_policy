287,kzn-b7ow-ugrn,"In the past decade, even as we have begun to understand how truly catastrophic climate change will be and  how little time we have left to act, too many banks have given lip service to reducing carbon emissions while continuing to invest millions in loans to fossil fuel companies in support of the activities that are driving this crisis.  Regulators must stop financial institutions from gambling with our future through shortsighted business decisions that will destroy both our economy and the environment. 
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: 1)	Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2)	Plan for climate change over a long-time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available- 3)	Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits;  4)	Make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must ensure that the actions of big banks’ match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
Thank you for taking on the vital matter of climate change. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to begin acing now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk.","The comment criticizes banks for their continued investment in fossil fuels despite acknowledging the catastrophic impact of climate change. It urges regulators to prevent financial institutions from making short-sighted decisions that harm the economy and environment. The commenter supports the proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management at all business levels, plan for long-term climate change, define risk exposures, and align internal strategies with public climate commitments. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is called upon to ensure banks' actions align with their net-zero carbon emission commitments and to include climate risk management in supervisory ratings. The commenter emphasizes the importance of strong guidance from the OCC to minimize climate risk for the public and banks."
211,kzk-2l1i-zrv8,"It is not an exaggeration to say that our children's and grandchildren's futures depend on us halting the use of fossil fuels everywhere. Climate change is at a tipping point, meaning that if immediate change does not happen, things will rapidly get much, much worse in terms of our planet warming, sea levels rising, massive storms and wildfires increasing exponentially, etc., and human suffering and death also increasing exponentially.
It is essential that we Stop the Money Pipeline. Banks now have the opportunity of changing how they do things, by putting money into renewable energy instead of into fossil fuels. Fossil fuels produce large quantities of carbon dioxide when burned. Carbon emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to climate change. When fossil fuels are burned, they also release nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain.
Where I live, in Louisville, Colorado, we just lost over 1000 homes due to a fire that spread unbelievably rapidly due to extreme winds. This is one result of our planet's warming. Nothing like it has never happened here before. Thankfully my home escaped the fire.
The OCC regulates federal banks by publishing regulatory guidance about how banks must conduct business and disclose the risks they are taking. A new draft guidance would require banks to face up to the true risks of climate change. It is essential that this guidance be put into effect immediately. Strong OCC action is necessary, and not just as a first step -- continued pressure by the OCC is absolutely necessary. 
Banks, with their massive investments, have the opportunity of making a difference by investing in clean energy rather than fossil fuels.","The comment emphasizes the urgent need to halt the use of fossil fuels to protect future generations from the worsening impacts of climate change, such as global warming, rising sea levels, and increased natural disasters. The author advocates for the ""Stop the Money Pipeline"" initiative, urging banks to redirect investments from fossil fuels to renewable energy. They highlight the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels, including carbon emissions and air pollution. The author shares a personal experience of a devastating fire in Louisville, Colorado, attributed to climate change. They call for immediate implementation of new regulatory guidance by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to ensure banks acknowledge and address climate risks. The comment stresses the importance of strong and continuous OCC action to encourage banks to invest in clean energy."

Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, as stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing in response to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of Summit  Bank in Eugene, Oregon. We are a nearly $1 billion community bank with a focus on business, SBA, and  equipment lending and the only bank headquartered in our county. We are highly engaged in our  community and attentive to risk management. I am concerned that the proposed framework for  managing climate-related financial risk management for large banks will negatively impact community  banks and the communities that we serve for reasons stated below.  DIVERSION OF RESOURCES AWAY  FROM THE COMMUNITY TO BANK ADMINISTRATION * Considering the fact that data and tools to  measure and quantify climate-related financial risks are not fully developed, the complexity of scenario  anlysis will require community banks to hire costly third-party consultants to perform the work. *  Availability of qualified third-partly consultants will be limited as there will be few if any currently  qualified in our community. * The ramp-up time and cost to hire or train existing staff will divert  personnel and funding dollars away from lending to the small business that are the backbone of our  community.  REDUNDANCY OF PRACTICES * Existing risk management practices are effective and have  enabled community banks to manage climate-related risks for decades. * Community banks already  actively stress test loan portfolios to identify risk impact of potential default for various scenarios. * The  current transition to CECL presents additional attention to risk through comprehensive modeling  analysis.  ADVERSE IMPACT TO SMALL BUSINESSES * Most business customers will lack the expertise to  provide the climate data community banks will be required to gather. * The cost to implement the  additional framework will tighten margins resulting in rate increases and costs to the small businesses  community banks support.  ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL * Circumstances are different for each  institution with respect to size, business model and client portfolio. * Supervisory expectations  concerning scope and the extent of data or scenario analysis capabilities should reflect the nature of the  institutions loan concentrations and risk exposure. * Given the small size, relative non-complexity and  lower risk profile of community banks compared to large banks, the scenario analysis presents an  unnecessary burden to community banks.  We would appreciate your consideration of the above  mentioned items. As you know, community banks are a key component of the economy and the most  significant lending channel providing funding to small businesses across the country.  Thank you for your  continued support of community banks. Please feel free to contact me directly at 541-684-7533, at any  time.    Sincerely,    Craig Wanichek - President and CEO","Craig Wanichek, President and CEO of Summit Bank, expresses concerns about the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework for large banks, arguing it could negatively impact community banks. He highlights several issues: 

1. **Resource Diversion**: Community banks may need to hire costly third-party consultants due to underdeveloped data and tools, diverting resources from community lending.

2. **Redundancy**: Existing risk management practices are already effective, and community banks actively stress test loan portfolios.

3. **Adverse Impact on Small Businesses**: Business customers may lack expertise to provide required climate data, and implementation costs could tighten margins, increasing rates for small businesses.

4. **One Size Does Not Fit All**: The framework should consider the unique circumstances of each institution, as community banks have a lower risk profile compared to large banks, making the proposed scenario analysis burdensome.

Wanichek urges consideration of these points, emphasizing the vital role of community banks in supporting small businesses and the economy."

INTERNATIONAL BANCSHARES  CORPORATION  June 3, 2022  Via email: Comments@fdic.gov  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary  Attn: Comments- RIN 3064-ZA32  550 17th Street N.W.  Washington, D.C. 20429  Re:  Comments on Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions (RIN 3064-ZA31)  Dear Sir:  The following comments are submitted by International Bancshares Corporation (""IBC""),  a publicly-traded, multi-bank financial holding company headquartered in Laredo, Texas.  IBC maintains 167 facilities and 261 ATMs, serving 75 communities in Texas and  Oklahoma through five separately chartered banks (""IBC Banks"") ranging in size from  approximately $480 million to $9.3 billion, with consolidated assets totaling over $16  billion. IBC is one of the largest independent commercial bank holding companies  headquartered in Texas.  This letter responds to the request for comment by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (""FDIC"") related to the FDIC's Statement of Principles for Climate-Related  Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (""Statement""). The Statement  contains draft principles that would provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound  management of exposures to climate-related financial risks for large banks with over $100  billion in assets. The FDIC wants to implement these principles in order to ""support efforts  by large financial institutions to focus on key aspects of climate-related financial risk  management."" [Statement at 19507]  The statement outlines two primary climate-related risks: physical risks and transition  risks. According to the FDIC,  Physical risks generally refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute,  climate-related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, and  chronic shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in  precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. Transition risks  generally refer to stresses to certain financial institutions or sectors arising from  the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated  with the changes necessary to limit climate change. [Statement at 19508]  IBC has provided general comments and comments to the specific requests as noted  below.  709078.000074 4895-2182-5057.4  1  P.O. DRAWER 1359, LAREDO, TEXAS 78042-1359 {956) 722-7611  IBC-6011-01 
General Comments  The FDIC and other federal regulators should be careful not to conflate ""climate change""  and climate-related risk. Any implementation of the principles or other related regulatory  requirements needs to clearly define ""climate-related risk."" Many articles and studies on  climate-related risk focus on any number of future timelines and speculate on widely  differing scenarios about how ""climate change"" may affect climate-related risk. Using  these two terms coextensively is a mistake. The existence, extent, and effects of ""climate  change"" remain the subject of a continuing debate, data collection and evaluation.  Climate science is in its infancy. IBC does not dispute that wildfires, hurricanes, and other  destructive weather events may be leading to increased climate-related risks. However,  it is important for the FDIC to be clear and accurate with its terminology in this space. This  is especially important in order for insured institutions to understand exactly what the  FDIC's goals are. Is it the case the FDIC is primarily concerned with, in its opinion,  addressing ""climate change"" or the threat of climate-related risk related to insured banks'  stability? These are two vastly different issues that would require significantly different  plans and implementations, to say nothing of the fact that the FDIC, as a financial  regulator, generally should not be engaging in environmental policymaking.  The FDIC has a solution in search of a problem. Existing FDIC rules and guidance already  provide a comprehensive risk management and safety and soundness framework for  insured banks. [Statement at 19509] The risks the FDIC notes in the Statement are not  fundamentally novel or unique. Regarding physical risk, hurricane alley exists. Flood  zones exist. Tornado zones exist. Regarding transition risk, automobiles and the internet  were invented and categorically changed our lives and the financial system of this  country. Historically, banks have taken these realities into consideration in all of their  activities, from consumer lending to merchant banking investments. It would be criminal  ineptitude if the largest bank lenders to fossil fuel companies did not consider the  changing economy and rise of renewable energy as a challenge to such markets as a  matter of course. The FDIC seems to believe climate-related risk is an ephemeral threat  that is otherwise not on the radar of insured banks. IBC is confident this is far from the  truth. Climate-related risks are merely another case of changing times requiring a re- evaluation of the market landscape at both a micro and macro level, a process that banks  have engaged in since the dawn of the modern financial system. The threat of  environmental risks is not new, it is merely changing. Like all geographic changes, banks  will learn to adapt or will face the consequences, like every other business. Did the FDIC  step in with highly burdensome principles and guidelines when the internet threatened to  throw our economy into upheaval? Did the FDIC step in when horse and buggy  businesses faced obsolescence from automobile manufacturers? Or did the FDIC leave  it to the banks' discretion in considering these economic realities when engaging with  those businesses and markets? This is no different than traditional oil and gas companies  facing increased uncertainty due to competing renewable alternatives. Unless the FDIC  thinks these risks fundamentally endanger the insurance fund, it should not attempt to  strong-arm a climate agenda onto insured depository institutions.  Banks are well-practiced in adapting to and managing changes in consumer market  preferences and the commercial environment. Climate-related financial risks are already  2 
naturally embedded into this risk assessment process through the dynamic market,  economic, and counterparty data that are the backbone of robust risk management. As  the policy goals, definitions, and methodologies behind climate-related financial risk  identification evolve, banks of all sizes will continue to apply traditional credit and financial  risk tolerances and parameters to their balance sheets to manage their risks and support  the customers and communities they serve. The heavy hand of regulators is not needed  to ensure adequate consideration by insured banks.  Banks, like all other businesses in this country, will begin to factor in additional climate  considerations throughout their activities as applicable. These principles should not be  foisted upon banks in an attempt to create an artificial response instead of allowing the  response to grow and be addressed naturally. The free market should be left to address  any climate-related risks and the changing economy, and stakeholders should be left to  adjust their policies and practices over time to adapt to these changes. Time will also  reveal through innovation new ways to adapt to the changes and any challenges.  IBC also urges the FDIC to work in close conjunction with the other banking and financial  agencies and international standard setting bodies to address climate-related risk,  including closing data gaps and applying a consistent set of definitions, assumptions and  methodologies. Notably, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities  Exchange Commission have both recently published proposed guidance and new rules  related to climate risk. The FDIC should work with these and other federal regulators to  ensure that any climate risk guidance and rules are conformed and harmonized between  the various regulatory frameworks that apply to insured banks. This is especially true of  the National Credit Union Administration, as banks should not (again) be subject to  onerous regulatory obligations that their tax-advantaged credit union counterparts are not.  Climate-related risk should not be another area in which banks face a huge disadvantage  compared to credit unions, primarily driven by regulatory malpractice.  Additionally, the principles single out climate-related risk from other risks for unnecessary  special treatment. Insured banks no longer may simply treat climate-related risk as they  would any other risk. Instead, the principles would require banks to specifically focus on  climate-related risk in a variety of ways. For instance,  1. Banks must communicate about climate-related risks in particular, must specially  assign responsibilities for them ""throughout the organization,""  and must be  reported by bank management to the board. [Statement at 19509]  2. Climate-related risk is singled out for assessment with regard to ""stakeholders'  expectations, the bank's reputation, and ... disadvantaged households and  communities."" [Statement at 1951 O]  3. Banks must ""incorporate climate-related risks into their internal control  frameworks, including internal audit,"" regardless of whether those risks would  qualify for control or audit coverage under the procedures that the banks have  reasonably adopted for other sorts of risk. [Statement at 1951 O]  4. Bank management must ""develop and implement ...  scenario analysis  frameworks"" for climate-related risks but not for other risks. [Statement at 19510]  3 
5. Banks are to ""consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting  and ongoing monitoring of portfolios."" [Statement at 19510]  Singling-out climate-related risk for these additional and heightened analyses and  obligations is unjustifiable. Climate-related risks do not pose greater risk than, for  example, technological disruption, economic downturns, domestic political changes,  foreign conflicts, civic unrest, changing consumer preference, and public health crises.  IBC is especially concerned that federal regulators are choosing to focus on issues that  are not critically important to financial institutions, while ignoring problems that  fundamentally challenge the continued safety and soundness of regulated depository  institutions. For example, changes in consumer protection regulations, financial services  technology, and the Uniform Commercial Code have greatly increased the risk of fraud  and unauthorized transactions, and the potential liability of financial institutions related to  those risks. Instead of climate-related risk, financial institutions and their customers would  be much better served if regulators could focus on and address the increased fraud risks  and related liabilities. Even if climate-related risk is one of the most important risks for  certain institutions, that is not true for all insured banks, let alone the vast majority of those  banks. Banks would be encouraged, potentially required, to exclude entire geographies  and markets that are implicated in climate-related risks. By singling out climate-related  risk for special attention and treatment, the principles would prompt banks to deny  financial services and credit, or offer such on worse terms, to consumers and businesses  that might be affected by climate-related risk. This would be de-risking on steroids. This  includes the entirety of the traditional energy and agricultural sectors, other industries that  are carbon-intensive, or consume large amounts of water, energy, and other resources  or produce, supply, or consume fertilizer and chemicals, or generate waste, as well as  others that may be alleged to be at risk from possible changes in law or public opinion  regarding climate-related risk. There would be no clearer example of the government  picking and choosing winners and losers in the economy writ large. This is patently  unacceptable. Because the principles require banks to consider climate-related risks to  ""the bank's reputation,"" banks would be forced to consider whether loan applicants  viewed favorably by ""green activists"" or are ""green enough."" [Statement at 19511] Banks  may interpret the principles to require that they lend only to businesses that make certain  ""green commitments"" (e.g. net-zero emissions by 2030, etc.). Businesses that are  accused of or perceived as harming the climate or not being ""green"" enough may find it  hard to obtain credit or reasonable loan terms. Banks may even refuse to provide  standard transactional and deposit services to businesses that are no in favor with climate  activists.  Finally, IBC notes that climate-related risks and impacts are actually not all detrimental to  banks, and can actually increase the health and stability of a bank's operations. In fact, a  study published by the Federal Reserve found that weather disasters have not, in fact,  damaged banks' bottom lines in any material way, and concluded that weather disasters  are not likely to be a material source of bank instability, regardless of the size of the bank.1  1 See "" How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks?"" available at  (https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr990.pdf); and ""How Bad Are  Weather Disasters for Banks? Not Very, Study Finds,"" available at  4 
The Federal Reserve found that, between 1995 and 2018, increased lending by banks  heavily concentrated in geographic areas affected by natural disasters and major weather  events actually increased the banks' profitability and only caused modest increases in  loan-loss rates. After large weather disasters, both consumers and businesses may need  credit to rebuild and repair. Earnings on new loans related to these destructive events  can offset losses on prior loans and ultimately strengthen a bank's balance sheet, to say  nothing of the good these new loans do for the community re-building efforts.  Specific Requests for Information  A. Applicability  Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model,  should inform financial institutions' adoption of these principles?  IBC Comment: IBC strongly urges the FDIC to make clear that these principles  will not be applicable to or held against institutions with less than $100 billion in  assets, which amount should be indexed for annual future increase. IBC also asks  that the FDIC exempt minority-owned depository institutions and community  development institutions from the principles. These institutions largely serve rural  and underserved communities and would be completely hamstrung if additional  restrictions on their ability to lend or provide services to these populations were  implemented. Defining and quantifying climate-related impacts on traditional bank  risks is a relatively new and complex process. Given all of the uncertainties, and  to accommodate what will likely be significant changes to the practice of climate- related financial risk identification, IBC urges the FDIC to continue to take a  principles-based approach that is flexible and iterative, and that allows banks to  assess the risks they identify as the most material to their unique circumstances.  IBC requests that the FDIC not expand the scope of the principles to these banks  until more robust data is available, and the climate-related financial risks and  opportunities are better understood.  As a general note, the complexity of what is being proposed and asked of insured  banks regarding measuring, monitoring, and controlling climate-related risks can  only be met by the largest financial institutions. The level of difficulty of expertise,  to say nothing of the time and costs, required is simply outside the capabilities of  small and mid-sized community banks. This will no doubt be a boon for ""climate  consultants"" who will start aggressively marketing their services to financial  https://www.newsdesk.lexisnexis.com/click/?p=aHROcHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2Rlc2subGV4aXNuZXhpcy5j  b20vYXJOaWNsZS80NzQOMjE50TkzMy5odG1sP2hsaD02NWZINTdkYyZmaWQ9MTl1MDEONCZjaWQ  9lVRBM09ESTQmdWlkPU 1UTXdNVGd6&a=47 442199933&f=UHJpbnQ&s:::YWxlcnQ&u=am1 leWVyQG  R5a2VtYS5jb20&cn=RHlrZW1hlEdvc3NldHQgUExMQw&ci=107828&i=335&si:::72083&fmi=654543496&  e:::QW1 lcmljYW4gQmFua2Vy&d=130183&t=3&h=1 &mbc=Q1 QzL2E9NDcONDlxOTk5MzMmcDOxNGUm  djOxJnM9MSZobGg9NjVmZTU3ZGMmZmlkPTEyNTAxNDQmeD1 RMFd6eDILbjdhWFZXL TRwVW96NVI  3JnUxPU5EJnUyPXVwLXVybj p 1 c2Vy01 BBNTUzNjg4NQ&fi::: 1250144&ai=226734&wa= 1 &ac=226734_ 1  649246884000&ck=a91 f070fdb67f2652ac5bd 1 e6800fead  5 
institutions. Notably, the FDIC received at least one comment letter from such a  climate science consultant, which unsurprisingly included a full-throated  endorsement of the Statement and went as far to ask that the FDIC ""explicitly  require financial institutions to research, outline, and detail the correlation between  climate risks and the financial risks to which they are exposed, and provide  transparency into the data utilized to validate any assumptions that underlie their  models."" [Comment Letter of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.] Bankers should not  need a doctorate-level understanding of climate science in order to do their jobs.  Instead of focusing on creating jobs and helping local businesses, these principles  will simply spur bank ""investment"" in consulting firms in order to meet these new  requirements. It must also be pointed out there are many experts that do not  believe the science is settled when it comes to climate change. In fact, the ability  to forecast or model climate change is believed to be highly suspect. That is clearly  set out in ""Unsettled,"" a book authored by Steven E. Koonin, a climate expert.  B. Tailoring  Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its  climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size,  complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations?  IBC Comment: Future guidance will be absolutely necessary as the principles as  they currently exist are esoteric to the point of confusion, and do not offer any  concrete methodologies for how a small or mid-sized bank can even begin to start  addressing the issues involved. Future guidance will need to ensure that bankers  do not require a climate science degree to understand and implement the required  principles. It is critical that the FDIC seek frequent public input from banks of all  sizes to ensure supervisory goals and expectations align with current capabilities,  are properly calibrated to the risks, and regulations do not penalize bank  customers or the communities banks support.  Banks of all sizes must identify, monitor, and manage their risks. IBC highly  recommends that any forthcoming regulation will be tailored to reflect differences  in banks' circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.  Banks of differing sizes and complexity are engaged in different combinations of  activities, which in turn present a wide variety of risk profiles. This is also the case  with climate-related financial risks, with the added challenge of significant  uncertainty around definitions, data, and the capacity to build necessary systems  and expertise, as discussed herein. Many of the largest institutions are devoting  significant resources to better understand how to assess and integrate climate- related financial risks, while many smaller institutions are still trying to determine if  they have exposure based on current models and definitions, and if so, what it may  mean for their institution, their customers and their communities. Additionally,  smaller institutions rely on third parties for data, analysis, and reporting, so they  will need additional time to quantify and assess their climate-related financial risks.  6 
As argued herein, IBC asks that the FDIC not make the climate principles  applicable to small and mid-sized institutions until climate-related financial risk is  more precisely identified and understood, the methodologies have evolved, and  the FDIC can provide robust guidance and requirements. Future supervisory  expectations or further regulation will need to be calibrated for smaller institutions,  mitigating any negative impact on their communities.  Finally, one of the biggest challenges community banks would face in complying  with and implementing the principles is anticipating, measuring, forecasting, and  analyzing unknown and unquantifiable risks. The principles are incredibly broad  and lack specificity to help small and mid-sized banks and examiners identify  material climate-related financial risks that may warrant review and heightened  scrutiny. As currently proposed, IBC believes the principles do not contain  sufficient protections that would ensure examiners do not get carried away in  criticizing healthy banks on the basis of remote, highly speculative, or immaterial  climate-related risks. The principles also do not contain defined terms, detailed  hypothetical or explanatory examples, time periods for forecasting, or even a  common data set banks could use to analyze climate related financial risks.  Without these limits, the principles can broadly apply to every type of climate- related physical risk or transition risk imaginable, no matter how immaterial or  remote, and banks could therefore be subject to undue regulatory scrutiny and  enforcement actions for minor and immaterial deficiencies in their risk  management programs. The resources and costs that would be necessary to  comply with the principles would quickly overwhelm a community banks' limited  staff or force a community bank to de-risk entire industries or loan portfolios even  if the bank had no true safety and soundness weaknesses.  C. General  Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft  principles into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with  financial institutions to understand those challenges?  IBC Comment: To start with, the FDIC should make clear how these principles  should be incorporated into risk management systems. The FDIC already has  ample risk management regulations and guidance, as previously noted. To the  extent it feels the need to include these principles in that framework, it should carry  the laboring oar in order to do so. Banks already consider climate issues, such as  increased wildfire and flood risks, when evaluating transactions as part of their risk  management. If the FDIC wants to include these principles, or parts of them,  formally into its risk management requirements and guidance, it should do so itself.  Question 4: Would regulations or guidelines prescribing particular risk management  practices be helpful to financial institutions as they adjust to doing business in a changing  climate?  7 
IBC Comment: As always, clear and concise guidance from regulators is  necessary to enable banks to meet regulator expectations and provide stability to  the federal regulatory framework. Banks want to comply with regulatory  expectations, but it is nigh impossible if there is not sufficient guidance and  cooperation from regulators regarding their expectations. Especially given the  nascent stage of climate science and climate-related risk assessment,  comprehensive and flexible regulatory guidance will be necessary if the FDIC  chooses to impose climate-related risk obligations on insured banks.  Question 5: What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to  successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management  frameworks?  IBC Comment: As noted elsewhere herein, banks are already incorporating  climate risk in their risk assessment and management frameworks. As they have  done since our modern financial system was created, banks are adapting to the  changing economy and geographic realities without a mandate from regulators.  Markets change. Economies change. Land use changes. Climate-related risks are  not a uniquely new, insurmountable hurdle for banks to address without the  overbearing hand of regulators directing the way. Perhaps there is no one ""right""  way forward to address climate risks. In fact, there certainly is not, especially when  insured banks come in so many different sizes, locations, and specialties. The  FDIC should strive to provide guidance that is flexible and broadly adaptable by  banks of all types. Risk assessment and management is not broken, so there is  nothing to fix. Banks, as always, are constantly adapting based on new market  realities and changes without the need for regulator management.  Question 6: How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial risks  are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?  Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying  and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?  IBC Comment: Insured banks are highly-regulated financial institutions that are  key providers of liquidity within an economy that must support individuals,  companies, and communities in the immediate-, short-, intermediate-, and long- terms, often in the context of financing economic transition and avoiding the harm  that will come to communities if financing of businesses and industries essential to  local economies is abruptly or unnecessarily curtailed. A careful balance must be  achieved that recognizes the potential effects of climate-related risk, but does not  trigger actual transition risks harmful to the economy.  Some risks are considered in the short to medium term (1-3 years), such as  reputation, extreme weather, and public policy risks. Other risks are considered  over a longer time horizon, such as business, market sector, and geographic  8 
concentrations, demographic changes, operational resiliency, and geopolitical  trends. Climate-related credit risks should be considered on a time horizon  commensurate with the nature of the underwriting, transaction, and collateral. Time  horizons for climate-related risks should generally be tied to the underlying  transaction. For example, for short-duration loans and other instruments, the  appropriate time horizon may be current exposure and the exposure at 1 or 2 years  out. For mortgage-related assets, the 7- and 10-year time horizons are common  points of analysis and projection, while certain real estate transactions tend to look  at 10- to 30-year time horizons.  But defining and quantifying the impacts of climate-related risks on traditional bank  risks is a relatively new and complex process, with the assumptions backing the  analyses dependent on a vast number of policy choices and outcomes, over  timeframes that extend far beyond those used to assess traditional banking risks.  Climate-related risks are inherently tied to government action and policy, which is  simply unpredictable on a macro, long-term timeline. Will combustion engines  eventually be banned? Will sweeping changes to off-shore drilling rights and  permits be enacted in the next five years? It is impossible to know, but comfortingly,  it has always been that way. Banks have learned to assess risk in an ever- changing American economy. To the extent the FDIC is set on implementing these  principles, it should make clear what time horizons would be applicable to the  underlying transactions and should acknowledge the complicated and dependent  nature of such time horizons as applied to climate risk.  Question 8: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies - for example,  insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments - do financial  institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks?  IBC Comment: IBC generally does not use specific products to hedge, transfer,  or mitigate its climate-related risks outside of standard insurance products (e.g.  flood insurance).  Question 9: What, if any, climate-related financial products or services - for example,  ""green bonds,"" derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take  climate-related considerations into account - do financial institutions offer to clients and  customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose?  IBC Comment: IBC does not currently offer climate-related financial products.  Because of the dearth of accepted facts, data, and methodologies, these products  pose risks related to accurately pricing future climate impacts from both physical  and transition risks.  Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate- related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and  communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Should the  agencies modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the  9 
Community Reinvestment Act, to address the impact climate-related financial risks may  have on LMI and other disadvantaged communities?  IBC Comment: These climate principles will absolutely do more consumer harm  than good. In fact, it is difficult to see how both consumers and small businesses  will not be harmed if these principles are adopted. For example, how are banks to  provide sufficient access to credit and banking services to rural and poor  communities in ""climate-affected"" areas? How can banks provide affordable  consumer and small business credit in areas prone to climate-related risk? Areas  prone to fire and flooding are already populated largely by poor and middle class  consumers, as are areas of higher pollution and those in close proximity to super- fund sites.2 Are banks no longer encouraged to engage with rural customers in  these areas? As certain areas become more prone to fire and flooding, are banks  to simply ignore the needs of those communities? How are banks supposed to  meet their Community Reinvestment Act requirements if they cannot engage with  these populations in a fulsome manner? Even the FDIC notes that ""[a]dverse  effects could include potentially disproportionate impact on the financially  vulnerable, including low- to moderate-income and other disadvantaged  households and communities."" [Statement at 19509] These principles will have a  negative impact on persistently impoverished areas, areas of minority populations,  and low to moderate income tracts. Simply put, the FD I C's principles would create  a ""green-lining"" problem where institutions may refuse to lend to and service  consumers in climate-affected areas. This could be the new redlining of the 21 st  century. This is to say nothing of the potential negative financial impacts these  individuals will face if banks are restricted, or even prohibited from, lending to  certain businesses and industries due to perceived climate-related risk. These  individuals may face job loss or decreased salaries, in addition to a further erosion  of their communities as businesses move to find more hospitable geographic  markets.  The FDIC needs to consider how it will implement climate risk guidance and  requirements in a way that banks are not punished for making loans in climate risk- implicated areas, on one hand, and also not punished for not lending in majority- minority and LMI tracts because of climate-related risks on the other hand. If  climate risk obligations are not implemented thoughtfully and carefully, banks will  face a Catch-22 no-win scenario regarding their activities in areas facing the most  climate-related risk.  E. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting  Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models from  borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure,  monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial institutions  2 See, EPA, ""Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States,"" September 2021; available at  https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/climate-vulnerability_september-2021_508.pdf  10 
currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to  these data, metrics, tools or models?  IBC Comment: As noted herein, any climate-related risk principles or guidance  will almost certainly benefit the consultants that banks will be required to engage  and rely on, as bankers are not climate scientists. Many of the largest banks are  currently conducting climate-specific qualitative assessments, developing internal  models, and incorporating forward-looking, climate-related considerations into  strategy and new business assessment. As a practical matter, this nascent stage  of climate-related risk assessment means that banks are in the earliest stages of  exploring how to refine and adapt their management of climate-related financial  risks. For example, there is an absence of robust market data related to climate- related financial risk, a lack of standardized definitions surrounding what is meant  by climate-related risk, and limited information about how climate-related risk  interacts with traditional financial risks. The FDIC should proceed with care, and  avoid being ""too early"" on this matter, and implementing a framework that will  stagnate and become obsolete in a short time.  IBC believes that regulators should focus on ensuring that the largest, systemically  important banks are progressing in their climate-related risk assessment  capabilities and conducting internal climate-related risk analysis calibrated to the  risks that are material to their individual business model. Attaching regulatory  consequences to climate-related risk exposures at this time would be premature.  Additional regulation based on today's climate science and risk assessment  capabilities could potentially result in a misallocation of resources.  Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better  capture financial institutions' exposure to climate-related financial risks?  IBC Comment: If it must act, the FDIC should implement a modest set of general  principles and requirements for the largest insured institutions in order to  understand the effect such obligations may have on those institutions, small and  mid-sized institutions, and the nation's economy. Those findings should inform any  additional implementation of a more comprehensive climate-related risk  framework. Regulatory reporting requirements should scale with the size, clientele,  and complexity of the bank.  F. Scenario Analysis  Question 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management  that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial  institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they  face?  IBC Comment: Scenario analysis is typically a forward-looking assessment of a  potential future state of the world (or a specific section of it) over time, resulting  11 
from a plausible and possibly adverse set of assumed events or sequence of  assumed events. Scenario analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise  that should not be mandatory for community banks. To perform mandatory  scenario analysis, small and mid-sized community banks would likely need to hire  specialized consultants to perform the work. Even conservative estimates for an  independent audit can exceed $100,000. Because climate science is in its infancy,  there are few individuals and firms qualified to perform climate-related risk scenario  analyses. The demand for these services, if scenario analysis is mandatory for  community banks, would only drive up the costs of these audits and exercises.  Small and mid-sized banks cannot afford to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars  to third party consultants to perform climate-related risk scenario analyses,  particularly if these analyses are evaluating immaterial or remote climate-related  financial risks or are unlikely to result in any measurable changes to business  operations.  The accuracy and effectiveness of scenario analysis depends on the availability of  high-quality data, as well as advancements in modeling over medium and long  time horizons. However, given the immature state of modeling, including both the  availability of appropriate quality data and the modeling, detailed disclosure of the  assumptions used and projected financial impacts (i.e., the results) of scenario  analysis performed by banks are likely to be highly unreliable for the foreseeable  future. Any principles or guidelines should make clear that scenario analysis is just  one tool to be used in enhancing climate-related financial risk management. The  FDIC should make clear that scenario analysis is a separate exercise, distinct from  traditional stress testing, and is not intended to affect capital requirements or  supervisory actions. Any attempt to include scenario analysis into stress tests or  capital requirements are premature and would create confusion based on how  these nascent data sets and methodologies would influence current capital  requirements.  IBC recommends that until climate-related risks are better understood, and more  market and economic data is available, any climate scenario analysis be  performed using banks' internal models and processes.  Question 14: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and  executing scenario analysis exercises?  12 
While IBC appreciates the FDIC's use of principles rather than detailed or prescriptive  rules, IBC encourages the FDIC to continue to employ a flexible and iterative approach.  This will allow banks to adapt their risk management to their most material issues and to  adjust to the rapidly evolving climate-risk policy and practice environment.  Thank you for the opportunity to share IBC's view.  INTERNATIONAL B NCSHARES CORPORATION  President and CEO  13","International Bancshares Corporation (IBC) submitted comments on the FDIC's draft principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. IBC argues that the FDIC should not conflate 'climate change' with 'climate-related risk' and should clearly define the latter. They believe existing FDIC rules already cover risk management adequately and that climate-related risks are not novel. IBC suggests that banks are already adept at adapting to market changes, including climate risks, without regulatory intervention. They caution against imposing burdensome regulations that could disadvantage smaller banks and argue that the free market should address climate risks naturally. IBC also emphasizes the need for the FDIC to collaborate with other regulatory bodies to ensure consistent guidelines. They express concern that singling out climate risks could lead to banks denying services to certain sectors, potentially harming disadvantaged communities. IBC recommends that the FDIC's principles should not apply to smaller banks until more robust data is available and that any future guidance should be flexible and tailored to different bank sizes and complexities."
281,kzn-8y6c-ilyy,"Via Regulations.gov Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Washington, D.C. Re: Public consultation on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Comptroller Hsu: On behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), we are pleased to submit these comments on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) proposed Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. NRDC is an international nonprofit environmental organization with more than 3 million members and online activists. Since 1970, our lawyers, scientists, and other environmental specialists have worked to protect the world’s natural resources, public health, and environment. NRDC has offices in New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Montana, and Beijing. Through its finance and legal experts, NRDC remains engaged in financial regulation and views sensible financial regulation as an integral part of mitigating climate change. We appreciate the OCC’s leadership on this first, key step to integrate climate- related financial risk into its prudential supervision of large banks. Climate change presents a serious threat to individual banks and to the financial system. Banks should be encouraged to identify and mitigate climate-related financial risk and supervisory guidance from the OCC ensures that banks will rigorously undertake those efforts. “Climate change,” according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, “is an emerging threat to the financial stability of the United States.”1 The White House’s Climate Finance Report also emphasized that climate change poses risk for individual companies: “Across the board, hidden and underestimated risks from climate change obscure the growing potential for business disruptions, productivity loss, and bankruptcies.”2 Climate-related financial risks fall, broadly speaking, into two categories: physical risks and transition risks. “Physical risks refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute, climate-related disaster events such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves as well as longer-term chronic phenomena such as higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, sea-level rise, and ocean 1 Financial Stability Oversight Council, FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk at 3 (2021). 2 U.S. Climate Related Financial Risk Executive Order 14030, A Roadmap to Build a Climate-Resilient Economy at 4 (2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp- content/uploads/2021/10/Climate-Finance-Report.pdf. 1
acidification.”3 Transition risks arise “from the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change.”4 Companies have identified climate change as a significant source of short and medium-term risk. The Carbon Disclosure Project reported that 215 of the world’s 500 largest companies collectively identified approximately $1 trillion in climate risks to their businesses as of 2018.5 Over half of these risks were projected as likely to occur within the next five years.6 If this risk is not managed properly, the banking system could amplify the costs of climate change. A 2019 study published in Nature Climate Change found that climate risks could increase the frequency and severity of financial crises and the costs to the public of remedying those crises. The authors stressed that prudent financial regulation was key to mitigating future crises. We appreciate that the OCC is taking this important first step to manage climate risk in the banking industry. Our comments below address several of the questions that OCC posed in its Federal Register notice. 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? While we appreciate that guidance and oversights will start with the largest banks, it is essential to continue to expand guidance and oversight to all sized banks in the near term. Providing clear guidance for expectations and a timeline for smaller banks can help them prepare for both the risks themselves as well as upcoming examiner expectations. An additional need for clarity on upcoming examiner expectations for smaller banks, larger banks, while dealing with their own climate risk, could push their risks off onto other financial entities7, including smaller banks, possibly increasing climate risks for these smaller banks. 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? NRDC agrees that banks can use insurance and derivatives to mitigate climate- related financial risks, but there is a danger of solely relying on such measures to mitigate these risks. Banks require insurance coverage to mitigate potential losses due 3 Id. at 12. 4 Id. at 13. 5 Carbon Disclosure Project, Major Risk or Rosy Opportunity at 5 (2019). 6 Id. 7 Keenan, J.M., Bradt, J.T. Underwaterwriting: from theory to empiricism in regional mortgage markets in the U.S.. Climatic Change 162, 2043–2067 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02734-1. 2
to any loss event, including climate disasters. However, risks from both the insured and/or the insurer could revert the climate-related risks to the banks themselves. Borrowers are required to provide proof of insurance coverage for loan closing purposes. However, as regions prone to climate change effects are subject to increased risk pricing, higher premiums (or worse, the discontinuation of coverage) can lead to a lapse in coverage for borrowers in these areas. These lapses in coverage can be overlooked due to the loose enforcement of maintaining the required coverage. Counterparty risk could also swell during climate disasters as the insurers themselves are highly susceptible to climate-related risks. Many insurers invest their assets in investments vulnerable to climate disasters or transition risk. Climate events could drain the liquidity of asset pools used for payouts. Moreover, improperly assessed climate risks can lead to insufficient payouts as risk assessment maps of disaster-prone regions are not up to date. 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? In its draft document, OCC states: “The board and management should consider how climate-related financial risks and risk mitigation measures affect the legal and regulatory landscape in which the bank operates. This consideration includes … possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity.”8 NRDC agrees that banks must be encouraged to consider the fair lending implications of their climate risk strategies. As outlined below, there is a real danger that the adoption of enhanced climate risk mitigation measures by banks may result in disproportionate treatment of or impact to climate-burdened communities, including lower-income communities and communities of color. We urge OCC to expand upon the cursory guidance provided in the draft document and to consider additional regulatory actions to address likely impacts on disadvantaged communities. Fair lending laws prohibit banks from engaging in discriminatory lending practices.9 There are two categories of discriminatory practices for fair lending 8 OCC, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, p5. 9 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a); 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a). The Equal Credit Opportunity Act proscribes discrimination on the basis of race or color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, source of income, or attempted exercise of consumer rights. The Fair Housing Act proscribed discrimination on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap. Id. 3
purposes. Disparate treatment occurs when a lender treats a borrower differently based on a proscribed characteristic, such as race or sex. Disparate impact occurs when a facially neutral policy or practice disproportionately burdens a protected class of persons.10 If a disparate impact exists, the lender must show that the policy or practice is justified by “business necessity.” Even if a business necessity exists, however, the lender may be liable if there are alternative policies that serve the same purpose with less discriminatory effect.11 Because fair lending violations may carry substantial financial penalties for banks, fair lending risk is an important consideration in OCC’s risk-based supervision regime.12 Ensuring that banks comply with fair lending laws is also essential to OCC’s broader mission of “assuring … fair access to financial services, and fair treatment of customers by, the institutions and other persons subject to its jurisdiction.”13 Fair lending risk is especially acute where risks are distributed unevenly among potential borrowers in a manner that aligns with one or more protected characteristics, such as race. Climate change fits squarely within this category. A substantial and growing literature demonstrates that many climate-related risks, such as the risk of weather-induced disaster or sea level rise, may be disproportionately borne by lower income communities and communities of color.14 A November 2021 Staff Report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveyed this literature and concluded that “regions of the United States that are home to above-average shares of low-income and minority groups are likely to suffer the greatest meteorological effects of climate change.”15 The report also found that “low-income and minority Americans are limited in how they may adapt to climate change because they have less access to insurance and are less likely to have access to credit when needed.”16 10 See Regulation B, 12 CFR Part 1002, Comment 6(a); 24 CFR 100 s 100.500. 11 Id. 12 See OCC, Comptroller’s Handbook: Fair Lending, https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers- handbook/files/fair-lending/pub-ch-fair-lending.pdf 13 12 USC § 1(a). 14 See, e.g., Buchanan, Maya K., Scott Kulp, Lara Cushing, Rachel Morello-Frosch, Todd Nedwick, and Benjamin Strauss. “Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Threaten Affordable Housing.” Environmental Research Letters 15, no. 12 (2020): 124020; Keenan, Jesse, and Elizabeth Mattiuzzi. “Climate Adaptation Investment and the Community Reinvestment Act.” Community Development Research Brief 05 (2019): 01-30; Furman Center, Population in the U.S. Floodplains, https://furmancenter.org/files/Floodplain_PopulationBrief_12DEC2017.pdf 15 Understanding the Linkages between Climate Change and Inequality in the United States, p2. 16 Id. 4
The close correlation between climate and race (among other factors) raises the possibility that bank policies and practices intended to mitigate climate risk may create fair lending liability through disparate treatment of or (more likely) disparate impacts on borrowers of color. Moreover, even where bank practices do not give rise to legal liability under fair lending laws, they may unreasonably restrict access to financial services within climate-burdened communities.17 Of particular concern are risk mitigation measures that force individual households and small businesses to internalize climate-related risks. Such measures may significantly restrict access to credit within already-disadvantaged communities, further reducing their capacity to respond to climate-related challenges such as weather-related disasters or sea level rise. Such measures may also expose lenders to fair lending risk under the disparate impact standard if a less-discriminatory alternative exists. For this reason, NRDC recommends that banks avoid adopting policies that seek to mitigate climate risk by restricting access to credit for individual low-income and minority households and small business. To ensure compliance with fair lending obligations and promote fair access to financial services, NRDC recommends that OCC’s guidance document incorporate the following principles: • Banks should carefully and holistically assess their climate risk management policies and practices for potential disparate treatment or impact on the basis of race or other protected classes. • Banks should collect sufficient data on lending in climate-burdened communities to understand whether their lending practices result in discriminatory treatment or impact. The data should be disclosed to OCC and closely monitored on an ongoing basis for fair lending risk. In addition, banks should ensure that all data and models relied upon to assess climate-related risk do not include built-in biases. • Banks should provide fair lending training to all staff involved in assessing climate risk for lending purposes. The guidance should make clear that OCC will closely scrutinize banks’ climate risk management practices in accordance with the above principles. In addition, NRDC strongly encourages OCC to consider additional regulatory actions to ensure fair access to financial services within climate-burdened communities, such as updating official Handbooks and supervisory materials to include climate- related fair lending guidance, encouraging banks to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements through investment in climate adaptation measures in at-risk 17 Cf. 12 USC 1(a) (requiring OCC to ensure ”fair access to financial services”). 5
communities, and/or issuing further guidance or regulation on fair lending and climate. OCC should also coordinate closely with FSOC and other relevant federal agencies (such as FEMA and HUD) to ensure that regulatory changes in the financial sector do not inhibit whole-of-government efforts to ensure an equitable climate transition. 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? We recommend that the OCC ask banks to obtain a complete picture of climate risk for significant borrowers and counterparties. The data providing such a complete picture has three key components: Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, geolocation information for significant infrastructure, and any climate or sustainability disclosures made by the borrower or counterparty. Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions tell banks about a borrower or counterparty’s contribution to climate change and their vulnerability to transition risk in an orderly or disorderly move to a low emissions economy. “Scope 1 emissions are direct [greenhouse gas[ emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization. . . . Scope 2 emissions are indirect [greenhouse gas] emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling.” Scope 3 emissions are everything else: “the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain. . . . Scope 3 emissions, also referred to as value chain emissions, often represent the majority of an organization’s total GHG emissions.”18 The volume and trend of greenhouse gas emissions informs a bank’s picture of how a borrower or counterparty is managing transition risk. To gauge physical risk, banks should also obtain geolocational information for key infrastructure from borrowers. This would certainly include any collateralized infrastructure, but also information on any infrastructure that underpins significant operations. If, for example, a borrower has significant property on a coastline vulnerable to tidal flooding and extreme weather, that information ought to inform a bank’s risk analysis. Finally, banks should obtain borrower or counterparty disclosures under any climate or sustainability disclosure framework. Some of this information would be duplicative of the greenhouse gas emissions and physical risk inventory discussed 18 EPA.gov, “GHG Inventory Development Process and Guidance,” https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/ghg-inventory-development-process-and- guidance. 6
above, but disclosure frameworks also call for information about board oversight of climate risks, internal processes for identifying and managing climate risk, and projected financial impacts of climate risk. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? In addition to the scenario analysis guidance discussed below, we recommend that the OCC have banks report on their financed emissions, which is the volume of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the bank’s lending portfolio. The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials has developed guidance to assist financial institutions with calculating their financed emissions, including guidance about how to estimate the percentage of emissions from an activity attributable to the bank’s financing.19 As with knowing a borrower’s footprint of greenhouse gas emissions, a bank’s financed emissions footprint and its trajectory over time helps regulators assess the bank’s vulnerability to transition risk. 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? We agree that scenario analysis is an important climate risk management tool, and we believe it is one that all banks should be using to evaluate their climate risk and take appropriate steps to mitigate that risk. While banks seem to agree that scenario analysis is important, a recent study suggests that fewer than 10 percent of all banks are using it at the moment, and small banks are less likely to have incorporated scenario analysis into their climate risk management plans. Obtaining reliable information about borrowers’ climate risks is a problem for all banks (indeed, obtaining reliable information about companies’ climate risk is a general problem for regulators and stakeholders). For small banks that do not lend to public companies, it is an even greater challenge. The OCC can advance banks’ use of scenario analysis by providing supervisory guidance on its role in risk management and the appropriate scenarios for banks to use in scenario analysis. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? We strongly support the inclusion of scenario analysis for understanding the risks banks face. Past risks from extreme weather will not be a reliable predictor of climate risk, so banks will need to use models that consider that future risk. Thus, any 19 PCAF, “The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry,” https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/standard#the-global-ghg- accounting-and-reporting-standard-for-the-financial-industry. 7
guidance from the OCC on scenario analysis should emphasize the importance of using models that align with the latest climate science and that assume a range of global average temperature increases, including worst case scenarios. And to model transition risk, scenario analyses should include orderly and disorderly transitions to a low carbon economy. We encourage the OCC to use its supervisory guidance authority to ensure that all banks eventually use scenario analysis in their climate risk evaluations, and to eventually incorporate climate stress testing into its examinations. The OCC’s use of its supervisory authority can ensure that climate risk is consistently modeled, evaluated, and mitigated by banks of all sizes. *** We thank the OCC for its consideration of our comments.

The proposed frame work for managing  climate-related risk at large banks would certainly affect my banks negatively and further I believe it  would negatively impact the community banking system at large.  I would contend that existing risk  management practices in community banks, generally under $100B in size, are and have been effective  and have enabled these community banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. Further, unlike  large banks, community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system and should never be  subjected to one-size-fits-all regulation.  Lastly, the proposed scenario analysis is an expensive exercise  that requires specialized third-party expertise, and it should not be mandatory community banks given  the small size, relative non-complex nature of our business model and the lower risk profile of  community banks when compared to large banks.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am taking the time to personally write you regarding the FDIC’s request for comment on its statement  of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the  President of a small bank in the heart of the Coalfields of Southern West Virginia. Whitesville State Bank  was founded in 1946 and we just celebrated our 76th anniversary. We have a history of serving the coal  community and in a small way the coal industry. It is our way of life as well as the vast percentage of  economic opportunity for our citizens and thus, our bank. WSB is a $130 million dollar institution that  primarily serve consumers with Home Mortgage Loans, other consumer loans, and a small commercial  portfolio, all of which we keep on our books. We serve Boone, Raleigh, Wyoming, Fayette, and Kanawha  Counties with most of our customers living in distressed rural areas. In my 36 years as a community  banker, I have never seen the FDIC fine tune a regulation so that it does not affect small community  institutions and those effects are vastly more punitive to us. The cost us more via a myriad of negative  consequences that are an afterthought to the large institutions the regulations are written for. My  concerns are primarily outlined below:  • The continued spread of regulation and restrictions aimed at limiting GHG has already drastically  damaged our state’s economy. That impact will continue to increase negatively, and no consideration  will be given to the lives ruined in its wake. The regulation drops a bomb on our people, and they are  expected to simply move somewhere else. Their life’s work destroyed in the rear-view mirror.  • We currently manage climate related risk on an ongoing basis to ensure our services continue to flow  to our community, come what may. We plan, we test, and we implement common sense controls that  satisfy regulation and work.  • Unfortunately, we are too small to not fail. If we disappear tomorrow, it will be a blip on the FDIC’s  Insurance Funds radar. They won’t miss us, but this economy, this community, and this state, certainly  will if this death by 1,000 cuts continues.  • The expenses associated with this duplicative risk management will be very high for community banks.  We smother daily under the costs associated with the onslaught of compliance related expenses that  have poured out of D.C since the implementation of Dodd Frank. There will be a tipping point for us all  financially. Many have already tipped, as is evident by the sellout/burnout rate of community banks. It is  staggering and killing rural America.  • The personnel and expertise needed to run this new risk management process will be hard if not  impossible to find in rural America. We will struggle to train and fill the positions needed. That will only  add to the problems of BCP that all small banks face today.  WSB has navigated the rocky road of a commodity-based economy our entire existence. We plan for it  and we have weathered each storm that has come. We suffer with the people we serve and stand with 
them to make the best life possible for our citizens and state. It hasn’t always been pretty, but we adapt,  we plan, we mitigate, and we move on. I fear we are approaching a bridge to far from a regulatory  standpoint. We have been for years and continue to manage our climate related risks on a continuous  basis. We have been flooded twice over a 12-month period in the late 90’s at the main office in  Whitesville. We cleaned the catastrophe up ourselves and never closed a day or interrupted any  services. We have had blizzards, ice storms, derecho’s, power outages, and our mitigation strategies  have worked every time. We require flood insurance for customers, and we carry flood insurance for  ourselves where needed. All of what I have described was planned for, tested, mitigated, and retested  at great expense. Much more expense than the actual events caused us. The transitional risk that will  come from your new initiatives and the eventual continued decline the fossil fuel industry will  experience, will be hard to navigate. We however have been navigating this decline, whether market  driven, or regime change driven, for our entire 76 years of existence. This transitional future does not  look bright, but we will plan for it, survive it, and continue to serve whatever community we have left.  Further, with the adoption of CECL, my bank and other community banks will be required to consider  future risks, such as potential climate-related risk, in our loan loss reserve modeling. The concept of  Scenario Analysis, if required for community banks, is particularly troubling and concerning. WSB, like  nearly all community banks, is non-complex and of an overall lower risk profile than the largest banks.  There is no need to apply complex risk modeling such as Scenario Analysis to a community bank.  It should not be required of community banks, for the following reasons:  • Scenario Analysis would require community banks to forecast for remote, isolated, and speculative  risks and be of little practical utility to community banks that are already familiar with their  concentration risks and how to manage these risks.  • To conduct scenario analysis for transition risks, community banks would need to gather climate data  (such as greenhouse gas emissions data) from their customers, many of which do not maintain this data,  nor would they have the resources to gather it and will be furious that we ask for it    This expensive proposition would accomplish little and be impossible for small community banks to  absorb. The backlash to the process from our communities will cause reputational risk that will greatly  outweigh the new risk you are trying to measure. We continue to be told by our regulators what an  important role community banks play in our economy, society, and nation. Almost every agency I have  met with starts their presentation with those comforting words. Maybe it is possible to create banking  regulation that won’t trickle down to the bottom of the barrel where we are and drown us. My problem  is you haven’t been able to accomplish that in my 36-year career at WSB! I fully believe this flawed  initiative will be at my doorstep in short order if it is put into effect. If we are vital to our economies,  society, and nation, as we are told, then someone at the FDIC needs to hear and see what this will do to  the community banking industry!    Sincerely,    Robert L. Milam Jr. 
President  Whitesville State Bank","Robert L. Milam Jr., President of Whitesville State Bank, expresses concerns over the FDIC's climate-related financial risk management principles for large financial institutions. He argues that such regulations disproportionately affect small community banks like his, which serve coal-dependent regions in West Virginia. Milam highlights the economic damage caused by regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, emphasizing the negative impact on local communities and economies. He criticizes the high costs and complexity of compliance, which are burdensome for small banks, and warns of potential financial tipping points.

172,kzh-gjv2-6f53,"Comptroller Hsu, I am very concerned about climate change and the lack of effort by our financial institutions to face this threat honestly and responsibly, and I thank you for this draft guidance. It outlines a framework for robust assessment, disclosure, and risk management that will force banks to reckon with climate change risk. I urge you to resist all efforts to dilute this guidance and to follow up with scope and details as broad as OCC’s authority allows. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change–a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance recommendations to banks that they incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business, plan for climate change over a long time horizon and update models as additional data becomes available, develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting limits, and make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interests of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The commenter expresses strong concern about climate change and the insufficient response from financial institutions. They commend Comptroller Hsu for the draft guidance on climate risk management, urging resistance to any dilution of its scope. The comment highlights the contradiction between banks' public commitments to climate action and their continued investments in fossil fuels, which exacerbate climate change and disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The commenter supports the guidance's recommendations for banks to integrate climate risk management into all business levels, plan for long-term climate impacts, and ensure internal strategies align with public commitments. They emphasize the need for the OCC to enforce these measures, factor climate risk management into supervisory ratings, and recognize the vulnerability of community banks. The commenter calls for decisive action from the OCC to minimize climate risk and ensure banks' practices align with their climate commitments."
268,kzm-zi60-fa7m,"February 14, 2022 Michael J. Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, D.C. 20219 Via File Upload to https://regulations.gov/ Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 – Public consultation on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu, It is a pleasure to submit comments on behalf of Ceres and the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets. Ceres is a nonprofit organization with over 30-years of experience working on climate change. The Ceres Accelerator works to transform the practices and policies that govern capital markets in order to reduce the worst financial impacts of the climate crisis. It spurs capital market influencers to act on climate change as a systemic financial risk—driving the large-scale behavior and systems change needed to achieve a just and sustainable future and a net zero emissions economy. Ceres works with leading global investors and companies. Our Investor Network is currently 217 investors that collectively manage over $49 trillion in assets. Ceres is a founding partner of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and the Paris Aligned Investor Initiative, which includes investors focused on sustainable investments within their portfolios and other assets. Our Company Network includes approximately 60 of the largest global companies with whom we work on an in-depth basis on climate strategy and disclosure, among other issues. We congratulate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for designing these Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We also congratulate the OCC for posing its “Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask.” We also agree with the OCC that weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control potential climate-related financial risks could adversely affect banks’ safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system. Below, we provide our comments to your specific questions related to the proposed principles. We have also included an attachment containing operational and tactical recommendations Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104
previously submitted to the OCC meant to further support your vital work on climate and the investments required to address the FSOC report recommendations (please see Attachment 1). Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? We agree with the OCC that all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate- related financial risks. Furthermore, although these Principles closely track the OCC’s existing management for large banks, they target only those banks with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets (i.e., the largest banks). While this may be a reasonable starting point, the OCC’s enforceable Heightened Standards Guidelines for risk management governance has a threshold for banks with over $50 billion in consolidated assets.1 Ceres hopes the OCC will utilize the $50 billion threshold, as $50 billion institutions are already expected to have a sophisticated risk management framework under the Heightened Standards Guidelines and should thus be capable of incorporating climate-related financial risks into their risk frameworks. Ceres believes that climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets, similar to cyber security risks and the coronavirus pandemic, posing grave threats to banks of all sizes and business models. Moreover this risk is only increasing in terms of frequency and severity. According to NOAA, in 2021 there were 20 separate weather and climate disaster events where losses exceeded $1 billion. Furthermore, these climate disasters killed 688 people and cost the United States more than $145 billion last year. These acute and progressive physical risks have the potential to seriously disrupt the bank market as well as the communities they serve. For example, more than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters in 2021 and more than 80 percent of Americans experienced a heat wave. Climate impacts are already manifesting in the largest state economies. In just the last few years, California has experienced recording-breaking wildfires, in both number and size, that have taken hundreds of lives, bankrupted the state’s largest utility, left millions regularly without power and brought home insurability into question. Florida is facing rapidly rising sea levels and now-routine flooding that are eroding coastal property values and wiping out freshwater supplies. 1 See 12 C.F.R. Part 30, Appendix D. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 2
Climate risk is an existential threat and, as recently stated by the thoughtful and comprehensive October 2021 Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Report on Climate-related Financial Risk, is one that poses an emerging and increasing threat to U.S. financial stability. As such, we recommend that these principles be adopted by all U.S. banks irrespective of asset size, location, or business model. Additionally, although your current consultation seeks to promote a principles-based approach to improving risk management and supervisory practices related to climate-driven financial risk, we would encourage OCC to consider making some or all of these prescriptive and enforcing them as mandatory requirements as opposed to voluntary best practices.2 It is important to note that the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other foreign financial regulatory agencies are already taking these steps.3 Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? We understand that the OCC has designed these Principles to initially target the largest banks. In general, Ceres recommends that, as banks and the OCC become more adept at incorporating climate-related financial risk management practices, the OCC lower this threshold to include more than the largest banks over time as these standards evolve. However, we acknowledge that smaller banks, community banks, and credit unions have different capabilities than the largest banks. The OCC should therefore tailor its approach to accommodate for those size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations differences. To this end, Ceres suggests the OCC implement an assessment program similar to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (FFIEC) Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT), which was launched to assist banks and examiners determine a bank's risk profile and level of cybersecurity preparedness.4 The OCC should develop a similar assessment tool for climate- related financial risk, providing resources to help banks understand supervisory expectations, and 2 We believe the OCC should use its authority under 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1 to finalize this guidance and issue the final document as binding safety and soundness supervisory guidelines. After these guidelines are finalized, the OCC should continue to create more in-depth requirements. 3 The OCC should make use of the data these prudential authorities and their regulated entities have already collected and analyzed, including scenario analyses and stress tests. 4 See Attachment 1, Appendix A. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 3
assess and mitigate those risks. Like the CAT, this could include a pilot program at smaller institutions to enable state and federal regulators to assess how these institutions manage and mitigate climate risks. Based on this program, the OCC should publish its observations, including findings regarding inherent climate-related financial risks and institution preparedness. Moreover, the OCC should use the data it collects from this program to develop a self-assessment tool to assist smaller institutions in evaluating those risks and their risk management capabilities. To reflect evolving science and scenario analysis with a focus on risk management, collaboration, and resilience, the OCC should continue to update and publish new data it and the other financial regulators obtain and/or analyze. Such a tool would allow the OCC to tailor its guidance for smaller institutions, and enable those institutions to develop climate-related risk management practices without presenting an undue burden. Ceres also recommends that future guidance assist banks in factoring the climate change-related transition, physical, and reputational risks of their borrowers into their capital, loan pricing and credit allocation decisions. Furthermore, we believe it is important that large banks do so on a sector-by-sector basis, with consideration given to the unique transition risks (including legal and reputational) and physical risks inherent in each industry sector and client vertical. We note that some large banks have already developed climate-related financial risk management practices in line with this guidance. For example, in December 2021 Citi CEO Jane Fraser stated that Citi will start asking its clients to measure emissions and that a borrower’s climate impact will factor into lending and capital allocation decisions. In fact, the January Citi TCFD report addresses some of these issues. Additionally, current approaches to climate risk modelling by large banks, treat climate risk in a manner analogous to credit risk. By this we mean that climate risk is quantified using sophisticated models, and capital or risk limits are adjusted to account for this risk. For banks without these capabilities, or where the cost of implementation would be prohibitive, we suggest that future OCC guidance treat climate risk in a more prescriptive manner similar to its operational risk guidance on cybersecurity. This approach could involve requiring in-scope banks to assess underwriting of climate-sensitive industries, and in some cases recommending the complete withdrawal of lending activity from high GHG-emitting sectors where the assessed risk threatens a bank’s safety and soundness. Further, banks must develop the ability to assess if climate-related transition and physical risks will cause certain assets (including trading book assets) to become so illiquid that they are effectively “stranded.” Future guidance should assist banks in developing plans to unwind such assets, or set aside more capital against these potential “stranded assets”. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 4
Finally, Ceres recommends that future guidance for banks and bank holding companies involved in the trading and marketing of non-renewable commodities (including physical energy commodities and physical energy commodity derivatives) include a requirement to disclose the impact of climate-related risk drivers (including operational risk) around these products and services. General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Ceres maintains an active and regular dialogue with U.S. banks of varying asset size, location, and business model. Moreover, most of the U.S.-based G-SIBs are members of Ceres’ Company Network. Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks currently use some form of climate- risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing to evaluate the transition and physical risks associated with their lending portfolios. The main challenges they face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems are technical in nature. For example, • Even with considerable client engagement, they face difficulty in obtaining borrower- specific climate data (for example, GHG emissions), and so they are reliant on third-party data to provide index information. • In some cases, they are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, or the most relevant scenarios do not provide sufficient detail in some areas critical to financial institutions. The OCC should also make clear that having a transition plan is a crucial part of a bank’s risk management system, and provide guidance as to how these plans should be formed. Additionally, the anticipated plans for the Securities and Exchange Commission to propose climate disclosure for public companies will have a beneficial impact for all banks to gain more comprehensive and consistent information from their large clients.

Current Risk Management Practices 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate- related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? Many banks have identified specific tools and/or strategies in at least some detail in their general reporting, integrating climate risk into existing risk types and systems rather than treating it as a separate risk. 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? The OCC should provide clear guidance on the minimum requirements to conduct a materiality assessment. In conducting these assessments, banks should be required to report their results, including what data was used in the assessment to allow comparability across sectors, and an explanation of why information was determine material or not. Banks should also focus their assessments on financial opportunities as well as financial risks. Information banks should consider in making materiality assessment include context-specific metrics such as asset locations, local laws, and geographical information. Determination of whether such climate- related financial risks are material should mirror those determinations made in other risks assessments by a bank. 6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? Ceres research from 2019 shows that only one of nine banks studied is looking at a risk management time horizon longer than five years. Two others are looking longer term with respect to climate risk, but not for more conventional risks like credit risk or market risk. While there may have been some movement toward long-termism in the last two years, most banks are still focused on the one- to five-year time horizon. It is clear that to fully understand the climate risks banks face to their safety and soundness, they need to look at a longer time frame. In 2020, Ceres produced a report highlighting the risk due to transition risks of the largest banks. In 2021, we prepared an analysis of the physical risks of climate change to banks. Both of these reports highlight the imperative to have a longer time frame in the analysis. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 6
7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks have used, or have considered using both insurance and carbon offsets to mitigate climate-related financial risks. Regarding the use of insurance contracts, we believe that the residential mortgage divisions of large banks are directly exposed to the risk of insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal. Specifically, with the recent increase in acute climate-related physical risk comes the specter of home insurance price increases or possible denial of coverage in certain areas. For example, AIG recently announced plans to leave the California market due to climate risks. The most recent NOAA data shows that the U.S. has experienced 20 separate billion dollar weather and climate disasters in 2021. We believe that the bank market’s reliance on the availability of home insurance for its residential mortgage portfolio could lead to a climate-related gap in risk monitoring. As such, we recommend that banks study the potential impact of residential property insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal on the value, default rate, loss given default, and financing cost of residential mortgage portfolio holdings. We ask the OCC to consider including this risk in “Management of Risk Areas, Legal/Compliance Risk”. There is also risk for other portions of the banks’ portfolios. Our 2020 report highlights the risk by various sectors. With regards to the use of carbon offset credits (or other similar carbon trading schemes) as a risk mitigation strategy, Ceres recommends that the primary focus of banks should be on “absolute GHG reductions” through client engagement as opposed to “net GHG reductions” via financial engineering. As such GHG offset strategies should be used sparingly and only as a last resort. Ceres has produced a report, The Role of Natural Climate Solutions in Corporate Climate Commitments: A Brief for Investors to help banks and other end-users understand best practices when using this risk mitigation tool. Outside of insurance and offsets, banks’ relationships with their clients must be at the heart of any strategy for climate risk mitigation. Arguments that large banks “bank the entire economy” and as a result have no pathway to reduce their climate risk miss the critical role of client engagement and transition. Business within a sector can gradually be shifted towards companies with a higher share of sustainable assets and/or robust transition plans. The recently released 2030 plans from a few of the largest banks take initial steps with some of their client sectors. While actions are needed, these are good initial steps. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 7
For example, if a bank weighted its exposure to the utility sector heavily toward renewables and its exposure to the auto sector toward electric vehicles, Ceres analysis shows that some transition risk could be offset by the de-risking of green investments that would occur in a rapid transition scenario. Our analysis also shows the extent to which a bank’s vulnerability to transition risk is extremely sensitive to the choice of clients in climate-relevant sectors. The availability of “investable opportunities” is an important factor in how easy it is to mitigate risk through sustainable finance. The current structure of the economy will mean that most banks, particularly the largest ones, will have a “long” exposure to the business-as-usual case and a “short” exposure to the transition scenario. However, proactive banks may be able to capture enough sustainable opportunities to adjust this balance in a way that manages their overall transition risk. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks currently offer their borrowers a variety of “green” products, such as sustainability-linked loans, derivatives with embedded sustainability KPIs, etc. While we encourage banks to support their client’s climate risk management and sustainability efforts, banks should pay attention to the potential unique reputational risks these products entail, such as the risk of “greenwashing” by the bank and/or the borrower. Greenwashing is the process of knowingly or unknowingly conveying a false impression as to how sustainable or environmentally sound a product or service actually is. It can occur when the benefits conferred by the product or service are not material to the bank or borrower, or relevant to the borrower’s primary business activity. Similar to the SEC’s current initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct (SEC Division of Enforcement Climate and ESG Task Force), we encourage the OCC to include a requirement that bank compliance frameworks are updated to include greenwashing surveillance. As such, we ask the OCC to consider including this risk in “Management of Risk Areas, Other Nonfinancial Risk”. 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? For banks to credibly assess the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 8
communities, Ceres recommends that banks commit to principles of diversity, equity and inclusion and that bank board members and senior management are selected from a diverse and inclusive pool of candidates drawn from the communities that the financial institutions serve. Incorporating the principles of a just and inclusive economy is foundational to any effective climate risk management regime. Moreover, the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve should incorporate into any new interagency Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations expectations on how banks should consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk on LMI and other disadvantaged communities. We have previously submitted comments on CRA to support this important work, and appreciate the OCC’s decision to withdraw the CRA requirements established by the prior administration. The agencies should develop CRA examination procedures to assess individual bank climate-related performance and to collect aggregate industry data on LMI individuals and communities. Further, Ceres recommends the OCC incorporate explicit considerations for climate resilience and race as interrelated stability risks which banks must address. This could include activities that support climate resiliency such as explicitly targeting LMI communities of color for investments in urban infrastructure to boost extreme weather resilience; investments in renewable energy and water conservation projects for affordable housing to reduce utility payments; investments in flood resilience activities; and installation of air conditioning in multifamily buildings to reduce heat risks and utility payments.5 Likewise, the OCC should incorporate the insights and analysis produced by the Financial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC)6 - of which the OCC is a member - into its expectations on how banks consider climate-related financial risks on LMI and other disadvantaged communities. Additionally, to properly address the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households in LMI and other disadvantaged communities, bank board members and senior management must have proven climate risk management competence, training and experience. To ensure that board members have access to climate and ESG training, Ceres has partnered with Berkeley Law school to offer an online training program which 5 Although these projects exemplify the beneficial objectives of climate change resilience financing, it is not intended as an exhaustive list of activities that banks should consider in addressing the impacts of climate- related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on LMI communities and communities of color. 6 Under FSOC recommendations 1.8 and 1.9, Treasury and FLEC members should “evaluate climate- related impacts and the impacts of proposed policy solutions on financially vulnerable populations when assessing the impact of climate change on the economy and the financial system,” and “engage other members ... to analyze and understand the impact of climate change on the financial well-being of financially vulnerable populations.” Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 9
pinpoints how corporate board members can embed ESG into their oversight role. We encourage all bank board directors to participate in appropriate continuing education on these vital issues. We also encourage banks to build on their current efforts to include diverse voices into various levels of decision-making. It is important to have individuals representing different life experiences to advice on key financial decisions. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? Ceres has published two reports on climate-related financial risks for banks – one on Transition Risk and another on Physical Risk. In these reports, we recommend that banks engage with their borrowing clients on a sector-by-sector basis to obtain climate-relevant data, with consideration given to the unique transition risks (including legal and reputational) and physical risks inherent to each industry sector. Banks should update or refine their decisions based on this data as they obtain new information. Specifically we recommend that banks obtain the following data in support of effective climate risk management: • Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions data from borrowers, • Information on planned capital expenditures and their likely impact on company emissions, as well as transition plans (if available), • Geolocational information of all critical borrower infrastructure, • Borrower climate disclosures prepared using the TCFD framework (banks should encourage borrowers to disclose this information using the TCFD framework to ensure that climate-relevant data is comparable across industries and geographies), To minimize compliance costs, the OCC should also encourage and incentivize banks to actively contribute to the development and sharing of climate-relevant borrower data, as appropriate. Banks should collaborate with customers, peers, academics, and regulators to obtain and understand these data. The OCC should also encourage banks to use a common set of standards, such as the PCAF framework, for measuring their Scope 3 emissions associated with Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 10
client activities.7 Without a standardized framework, it may be difficult to accurately assess banks’ risk and the effectiveness of their mitigation strategies. Additionally, banks can take action on many climate-related financial issues despite uncertainty in other areas. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services notes that institutions “should establish board governance and an organization structure that supports the effective management of climate risks and develop their expertise and capacity to assess and manage climate risks on both sides of their balance sheets.” Such actions could “be implemented with relative speed and confidence.” 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? In our two recent reports on climate-related financial risks for banks (Transition Risk and Physical Risk reports) we make recommendations that the existing capital adequacy regime be expanded to include climate stress testing with eventual adjustments to both bank liquidity and capital requirements. In 2021, Ceres also provided testimony to the United States House of Representatives on the importance of climate stress tests as part of an effective bank capital adequacy regime. Moreover, Ceres recommends that existing regulatory reporting requirements for banks be expanded to require the use of the TCFD framework to ensure that public disclosure of climate relevant information is comparable across banks of varying asset size, location, and business model. Additionally, as part of identifying and quantifying climate-related financial risks, Ceres believes that large banks should establish and disclose net zero plans which describe in detail how they plan to decarbonize their business activities and achieve net zero emissions by no later than 2050. These plans should provide practical, actionable steps for banks to create an effective net zero transition, including assessment of assets that may be exposed to climate transition risk, internal valuation tools, and disclosure of risk assessments that identify climate-relevant sectors and the percentage of at-risk assets in these sectors. 7 Investors are increasingly requesting companies’ Scope 3 data, and the SEC will likely include Scope 3 disclosures in its new climate disclosure rules. If the SEC does include Scope 3 in its rules, this will decrease the burden on compliance with any future OCC rule. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 11
Furthermore, large banks should set detailed interim decarbonization goals (for example, 2030 or 2040 Paris-aligned goals) and provide a timeline with regular updates towards achieving them. 8 Finally, all interim goals and 2050 net zero commitments should incorporate the latest science, use credible climate scenarios, and disclose decarbonization progress on a sector-by-sector basis. Banks should engage clients on their own climate strategies by, for example, requiring clients to provide data in key climate-related areas, such as energy technology and emissions profiles; aggregating those data using methods such as carbon accounting; and building climate risk into day-to-day decision-making tools, such as client earnings models. The OCC should also incorporate results from its recent Call for Papers regarding “net zero goals and their effects on key segments of the finance industry,” including “integrated assessment models and their usage in a climate-risk loss forecasting context.” We encourage the OCC to consider augmenting existing regulatory reporting requirements to include this additional risk-mitigating disclosure. Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? Ceres maintains an active and regular dialogue with U.S. banks of varying asset size, location, and business model. Moreover, most of the U.S.-based G-SIBs are members of Ceres’ Company Network. Based on our interactions, it is clear that the uses and challenges banks face regarding climate risk management varies greatly by size. For example, many of the largest banks currently use some form of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing to evaluate the transition and physical risks associated with their lending portfolios. The main challenges they face in advancing their climate scenario analysis and stress testing programs are technical in nature: • Even with considerable client engagement, they face difficulty in obtaining borrower- specific climate data (for example, GHG emissions). o In general, larger, publicly-listed borrowers are more likely to provide banks with climate data, whereas small to mid-size and privately-owned borrowers are less willing or able to generate this information. 8 For example, banks could validate their goals through the Science Based Targets initiative, a recently launched a methodology for banks to set targets that include financed emissions. Although aligning with this methodology will enhance comparability, banks should focus first on a goal that will incentivize action internally and reflect their risk management strategy to the greatest possible extent. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 12
• In some cases, large banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model or the most relevant scenarios do not provide sufficient detail in some areas critical to financial institutions. In contrast, the use of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing for regional and community banks can be characterized as being in its infancy. Moreover the main challenges they face in advancing their climate scenario analysis and stress testing programs are both technical and operational in nature: • Some regional and community banks do not yet consider climate to be a material risk factor, and so are not engaging their borrowers in obtaining climate-relevant data, • When client engagement does occur, borrowers are unable or unwilling to provide climate data (for example, GHG emissions), • In some cases, regional and community banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, • Furthermore, they are often waiting for regulatory guidance before investing resources in the design of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress capabilities. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? When designing and executing scenario analysis, at a micro-level, we believe that the scientific rigor and transparency of the scenarios are paramount. As such, banks should ensure that their scenarios: • Are science-based and aligned with the most current climate change science, • For transition risk, the scenarios should consider both an “orderly” and “disorderly” transition, • For physical risk, the scenarios should contain at least one ""worst case"" scenario, • Assumptions regarding both demand and prices for commodities (such as oil) should be transparent and clearly stated, and • Scenarios should be aligned with current best practices (i.e., IEA and NGFS scenarios). From a macro-standpoint, the U.S. regulatory regime has proven itself to be robust and flexible enough to meet the challenge of many recent perils. For example, through necessity and quick action, regulators have been able to successfully navigate new threats to bank safety and soundness such as cybersecurity and the coronavirus pandemic.

Thus when considering which macro factors are most salient to designing and executing climate scenario analysis exercises we recommend that first and foremost the OCC continue to act with a sense of urgency around this existential and systemic threat. Second, as climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets and poses grave threats to banks of all sizes and business models, we recommend that these scenario analysis exercises should eventually be adopted by all U.S. banks irrespective of asset size, location, or business model. This could initially be tailored by bank size, with the threshold lowered overtime as more data becomes available to smaller banks, allowing those banks to build capacity. Third, the OCC will need to ensure that banks have access to educational resources in support of bank innovation regarding climate scenarios, models and data. Finally, we believe that climate scenario analysis exercises should eventually evolve into a formalized climate stress testing regime which informs regulatory capital adequacy metrics. Without climate stress testing (including a comprehensive capital adequacy regime), we believe that banks are at risk of running a higher quantum of enterprise risk than they are aware of, posing a danger to the safety and soundness of our financial system. Once again, we congratulate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for its fine work in developing these Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. Your leadership on this critical issue is deeply valued. We would be pleased to discuss any questions you may have on our feedback. In addition to the undersigned, you may also contact our Manager of Banking Financial Regulation, Kelsey Condon (kcondon@ceres.org) at your convenience.

Attachment 1: Recommendations for OCC Action to Address Climate-related Financial Risks I. Recommendations for OCC Action to Address Climate-related Financial Risks 1. The OCC should issue an exam manual dedicated to climate risks. In its recently proposed Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks,1 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) acknowledged climate risk is a cross-cutting risk that manifests through well-recognized and established types of risk. Among those risks, the principles highlight credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal/compliance risk, strategic risk, as well as reputation risk.2 With respect to each of these risks, the guidance lays out specific climate risk implications for banks to consider and address as part of the safe and sound management of their risk exposure. Ceres recommends that as the OCC gains experience with climate risk, that the agency issue an exam manual dedicated to the identification and management of climate risks based on established risk factors that are very familiar to banks and examiners. 2. The OCC should continue to use the Semiannual Risk Perspective and Bank Supervision Operating Plan repeatedly to highlight the seriousness of climate risks to institutions and the agency’s commitment to address these risks. We commend the leadership of the OCC for the many steps it has taken to understand and grapple with climate risks, including, first and foremost, proposing principles for climate- related risk management, appointing a Climate Change Risk Officer, establishing an internal climate risk implementation committee, issuing an RFI on a data tool for assessing physical climate risks, soliciting research on climate risk in banking to culminate in a June meeting, joining the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and participating in the Basel Committee’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks (TFCR). The OCC’s leadership is deeply valued. The OCC has already identified risks associated with climate change as a priority for the agency in both its Spring and Fall 2021 Semiannual Risk Perspective and Bank Supervision Operating Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 16
Plan. As the agency’s understanding grows it should use these two vehicles to identify its concerns with more granularity. The OCC should also leverage other forms of communication with the industry to clarify its expectations for managing climate risks including Qs & As and interagency pronouncements as it has done, for example, with financial innovation risk. See Appendix B. 3. The OCC should take a comprehensive approach to climate-related risk and issue binding Safety and Soundness Guidelines.3 Ceres commends the agency for issuing proposed principles for climate risk management for large banks and urges that the final principles and subsequent detailed guidance provide a comprehensive framework for banks to identify and manage physical and transition risks from climate change. Although guidance does not create binding obligations for banks, it does clarify agency expectations and examiners consider it as part of their supervision. The OCC has also issued binding guidelines in the past under the agency’s Part 30 authority to promulgate safety and soundness standards. These include heightened standards for risk governance for large banks with $50 billion or more in assets.4 The OCC should also issue binding guidelines under Part 30 for climate risk management standards for large banks. 4. The OCC should conduct a horizontal review of a targeted group of banks. The OCC should conduct a horizontal review to gain a better understanding of climate risk identification and management among a targeted group of banks. The OCC could use a horizontal review to gain an understanding across certain banks about their climate risk identification and mitigation strategies and practices. The OCC could target the large bank population that is the focus of its supervisory guidance on managing climate risks. This could also include the banks highlighted in Ceres’ reports with large exposures to climate risk through their syndicated loan portfolios,5 or banks with loan concentrations in particularly vulnerable geographic areas. The agency could use this exercise to gauge where the large banks are in their development and implementation of climate risk management practices in light of the OCC guidance. Further, the OCC could use these findings to inform the additional, more detailed guidance Acting Comptroller Hsu has mentioned is forthcoming and is also referenced in the proposed climate risk management principles.6 Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 17
II. Interagency Recommendations Interagency Case Studies and Recommendations Short-term actions by each of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) members individually is critical to address the risks to the financial system from climate change. While individual agency actions are important, collective action can sometimes send a more powerful and consistent message to the financial services industry. The benefits from the government acting on a joint or Interagency basis are clear. Such joint actions avoid conflicting or duplicative messages which create burden for industry and they can result in a more efficient allocation of resources by the agencies. Interagency Case Studies The agencies have demonstrated in the past that they can work quickly when they believe an emerging risk is significant and imminent. Appendix A details two case studies of timely responses to identified threats to the financial system. In the first example the agencies acted together over the course of 4 years to address the concern that the effect of the year 2000 date change on computer systems could have severe, far-reaching consequences for financial institutions. During the course of the 4 years, the agencies issued more than 20 interagency policy statements on multiple related topics, trained and deployed examiners who conducted multiple examinations at each institution, developed and disseminated educational content and conducted outreach, tracked and monitored progress, took action to address deficiencies and engaged in contingency planning. The second example involves the agencies’ collective action to address increasing cybersecurity risks. In roughly a year from identifying cybersecurity as a top priority for the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), the agencies had developed a risk assessment tool. The FFIEC quickly launched a dedicated page on cybersecurity for financial institutions and examiners, piloted a program at over 500 community institutions to assess management of cyber risks, published general observations from the pilot, outlined its cybersecurity priorities for the remainder of the year, and released a Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT). The agencies have since taken additional actions, but their collective efforts to highlight the importance of the issue, understand its implications for the regulated institutions, and give the industry a self-assessment tool, as well as a tool for examiners, in such a short period of time is instructive. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 18
These examples are evidence of constructive, timely, coordinated and effective actions agencies have taken collectively to address emerging issues. These examples provide a roadmap for interagency statements, guidance, outreach, training, examination, and accountability that could all be deployed in addressing climate risks. Recommended Interagency Actions 1. Conduct a Climate Risk Policy “Sprint” Regulators have begun to embrace the idea of a “Tech Sprint”. As you are aware, a Tech Sprint is a short, time-bound initiative to develop innovative and creative solutions to a specific problem in a collaborative way. Pioneered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the concept has been adopted by both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to solve challenging issues that transcend the capacity of one agency or organization to tackle. More recently, the FDIC, Federal Reserve Board (the Fed or FRB), and OCC announced that they are working on a Digital Assets Sprint Initiative (also called the Crypto Sprint) and just issued their first interagency statement based on the sprint. The purpose of the initiative is to increase collaboration and clarity around digital assets and involves a series of four sprints to address in a timely manner the many issues raised by cryptocurrencies. As stated by Acting Comptroller Hsu in his August 3, 2021 testimony before the Senate Banking Committee: The first sprint focuses on developing a common taxonomy for digital assets and agreed upon definitions to ensure a common language and understanding of the basic terms and concepts for future discussions. The second sprint centers on understanding use cases and risks associated with cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The third sprint concentrates on potential gaps in regulation and supervision and prioritizing those gaps for additional consideration. The fourth sprint will consider the policy needs based on the work conducted during the previous sprints. The FFIEC members should immediately create a Climate Risk Sprint initiative.7 This recommendation is consistent with FSOC Recommendation 2.1 (Fill data gaps) and Recommendation 2.5 (Data metrics and standardization). Using the Digital Asset Sprint Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 19
Initiative as a model, the agencies should conduct rapid sprints to first develop a common set of definitions to inform discussions and then review current and evolving risks to financial institutions. The agencies should conclude by collaborating in conducting sprints to evaluate the regulatory and policy gaps in supervision. Additionally, the FFIEC members could consider a TechSprint that involves the participation of outside experts – industry representatives, scientists, data specialists – to collaborate side-by- side with government officials to address potential data and technology solutions to assessing and managing climate risks. Such a collaboration facilitates new and beneficial connections and networks and focuses great energy and creativity to problem solving in a compressed time period. This type of TechSprint has been used repeatedly by the FCA and has also been adopted by the FDIC and CFPB. 2. Establish FFIEC Working Group As noted in the above case study on cybersecurity, the FFIEC was able to act with relative speed to address the rising cybersecurity risks to the financial system when it announced the creation of the Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Working Group (CCIWG). The CCIWG was formed in 2013 “to enhance communication among the FFIEC member agencies and build on existing efforts to strengthen the activities of other interagency and private sector groups” and quickly rolled out a series of announcements resulting in the release of the first version of the CAT in 2015. Similarly, the FFIEC should announce the creation of the Climate Risk Working Group, reporting to the Council through the Task Force on Supervision (TFOS). The purpose of the Climate Risk Working group would be similar to the CCIWG (i.e. enhance communication among members, and build on existing efforts by other agencies and private sector groups). The FFIEC can use the Climate Risk Working Group to develop a means to begin to assess and enhance the state of industry preparedness. Finally, the Working Group can identify gaps in the agencies’ examination procedures and training that can be closed to strengthen the oversight of climate risk readiness. The regulators could also consider establishing a body, such as the UK Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF), composed of industry representatives and convened several times a year by the Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 20
regulatory agencies.8 The CFRF has published a couple of best practices guides to assist financial institutions in identifying climate-related financial risks and opportunities. The latest guide is focused on risk management, scenario analysis, disclosure, innovation and climate data and metrics. 3. Issue Guidance through the FFIEC Using the CCIWG as a model, the FFIEC should issue Guidance to the industry to raise awareness of the risks, encourage financial institutions to integrate climate risks into their enterprise risk frameworks, and provide guidance on how to measure and mitigate risks, including through best practices. Guidance can be sequenced to first provide a declaratory statement that climate is a risk to both the financial system and to individual institutions. Subsequent Guidance can address first physical risks and then transition risks associated with climate change. Such actions can help fulfill FSOC Recommendations 4.7 and 4.8 (Review of supervisory and regulatory tools). Agencies can also help raise awareness by highlighting relevant events or milestones (see proposed Climate Risk Awareness Month below). 4. Develop a “Resources” section for climate risk on the FFIEC web page The FFIEC should develop a page on its website to list resources related to climate risk to the financial services industry. First, it can list all Guidance from the FFIEC or from the member agencies. The site could also link to other federal resources or agencies that offer helpful information. Given the increasing frequency of natural disasters, the agencies may want to create a section to consolidate interagency statements on regulatory relief for natural disasters. The agencies should also amend the Interagency Supervisory Examiner Guidance for Institutions Affected by a Major Disaster, adopted in 2017, which makes no mention of climate change. The Guidance should be amended to cite the risks associated with climate change and note that in many cases, natural disasters are no longer “exceptional”. 5. Create a Flood Insurance Resource Page and Update Flood Insurance Guidance Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 3305(g), the FFIEC is required to consult with the agencies responsible for supervising for compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program (FDIC, FRB, National Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 21
Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and OCC as well as the Farm Credit Administration) and develop uniform standards for use by financial institutions. While the Task Force on Consumer Compliance (TFCC) has had working groups to develop flood insurance compliance examination procedures for the agencies as well as Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance, no information on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is available on the FFIEC website. The FFIEC should take the following actions to both facilitate compliance with the NFIP by financial institutions as well as reduce the risks to financial institutions from uninsured and underinsured properties: ● Create a section on the FFIEC website devoted to flood insurance with information on the NFIP from the agencies or from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ● Issue updated guidance on flood insurance that incorporates risks from climate change Develop tools to facilitate compliance by financial institutions with the NFIP. ● Given that the flood insurance maps are out of date and do not reflect current risks, the agencies should encourage financial institutions to move beyond compliance with the Flood Disaster Protection Act and recognize that there are substantial flood risks for properties that do not lie within a flood zone. Financial Institutions should therefore consider the safety and soundness risks for uninsured or underinsured properties that lie outside of a flood zone when underwriting a mortgage. 6. Amend the Call Report Under the auspices of the Task Force on Reports (TFOR), the FFIEC should amend the Call Report to collect information on institutions’ climate-related financial risks, consistent with the FSOC Recommendations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.7 (Enhancing Public Climate-related Disclosures), using data terms defined by the Climate Risk Sprint (see above). The NCUA, as a member of the TFOR should also incorporate such changes into its call report for credit unions. As noted in FSOC Recommendation 3.7, such information collection should consider an institution’s size, complexity, and activities. 7. Amend the UBPR Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 22
The Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) is an invaluable tool for examiners to assess a bank’s financial condition and risks and to compare an institution with its peers. The UBPR, as a publicly accessible report, is also widely used by industry to conduct a peer analysis. The data from the UBPR comes directly from the Call Report. Following any amendments to the Call Report, the Task Force on Surveillance Systems (TFSS) should create standardized measurements of climate risk in the UBPR. Such metrics should be able to identify risks at individual institutions as well as risks among peer groups and in the aggregate. This recommendation is consistent with FSOC recommendations 2.5 (Data metrics and standardization) and 3.3 (Enhancing Public Climate-related Disclosures). 8. Host a webinar(s) for industry on risks associated with climate Over the years, the FFIEC and its member agencies have held numerous webinars and conferences for industry on various risk topics, including cybersecurity, Bank Secrecy Act/ Anti- money Laundering (BSA/AML) and the LIBOR transition. The FFIEC should host one or more webinars for banks and credit unions on the risks of climate to financial institutions of all sizes and the need to measure and mitigate climate risks. 9. Develop a Climate Risk Assessment Tool Following the creation of the CCIWG, the FFIEC released the first version of the CAT. The CAT was a unique development by the agencies; rather than releasing a regulation or regulatory guidance and expecting institutions to comply on their own, the FFIEC developed a tool to help financial institutions to understand and assess their cybersecurity risk and preparedness. This was particularly helpful to smaller financial institutions that lack the resources to conduct such an analysis internally. Similarly, the FFIEC’s Climate Risk Working Group should develop a Climate Risk Assessment Tool to help financial institutions, particularly smaller, community financial institutions, be able to identify their risks associated with climate change as well as their preparedness under various climate scenarios. By clarifying expectations, FFIEC members will address FSOC Recommendation 4.8 (Review of supervisory and regulatory tools). Ideally, the Tool would be based on accepted national or international standards and would provide financial institution management with actionable steps to mitigate risks. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 23
10. Include climate risk as a topic in the FFIEC “Supervisory Updates and Emerging Issues” conference for examiners The FFIEC provides specialized education and training for examiners from the agencies. One such offering is the Supervisory Updates and Emerging Issues Conference. The conference provides experienced examiners with training on developments in the financial services industry, including new products, new technologies, and emerging risks and other issues. The FFIEC should include climate risk as a topic in its emerging issues conference to update examiners on this risk to the financial services industry and the measures being taken by both regulators and banks and credit unions to mitigate such risks. 11. Use the upcoming modernized CRA proposed rules to Address the Disproportionate Impact of Climate Change on Low and Moderate Income Communities The FSOC report on climate-related financial risk explicitly recognizes that “climate change disproportionately affects financially vulnerable populations potentially including lower-income communities, communities of color, Native American communities, and other disadvantaged or underserved communities.” Noting that while vulnerable communities may be more exposed to climate-related risks, there’s also a recognition that actions to address such risk, such as through higher insurance and credit costs, may disproportionately impact financially vulnerable communities. The report calls for thoughtful and balanced policy responses. The interagency efforts underway to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules provide an opportunity for a thoughtful and balanced policy response. There are myriad ways in which the forthcoming proposed CRA rules could address the impact of climate change on low and moderate-income communities and communities of color. Ceres submitted two CRA- related comment letters.9 These include several specific recommendations for your consideration with the upcoming updates of CRA. 12. Update the Shared National Credit Program to account for climate-related risks Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 24
The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program assesses credit risks and trends as well as the risk management practices associated with the largest and most complex credits shared by multiple regulated financial institutions. The SNC Program is conducted by the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC for credits involving three or more regulated institutions for aggregate credit commitments of $100 million or more. The most recent SNC Report highlighted the high and increasing risk of leveraged loans as well as the industries most impacted by COVID-19 in the pool of SNC loans. The industries most impacted were oil and gas, entertainment and recreation, and transportation services. Given the size and impact of SNCs, the three federal prudential regulators should update the SNC review process to account for climate-related risks. While some SNC commitments could be vulnerable to severe weather events, other SNC commitments to industries that are highly dependent on fossil fuels may be affected by transition risk. To the extent that there are trends associated with climate-related risk, the agencies should highlight those in the SNC Program report. 13. Urge the White House to designate a “Climate Risk Awareness Month/Week/Day” at the federal level There are commemorative designations for each month, week, and day of the year to raise awareness of issues. September is National Preparedness Month; October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month. The federal government should designate a month (or week or day) to climate risks, including risks to the financial system. Congress can do so by enacting legislation but the White House can also provide for commemorative designations by proclamation.10 Dedicating a month or week to the risks posed to the financial and other industry sectors from climate change would help raise awareness of such risks beyond the environmental toll. Once designated, the financial regulators should promote the date(s) to help raise awareness.

Appendix A - Interagency Case Studies Interagency Coordination on Y2K Overview of Process Financial regulators began preparing for the Year 2000 date change (Y2K) as early as June 1996, when the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) issued an interagency joint statement concerning the potential effect of year 2000 on computer systems.11,12 To address potential challenges raised by Y2K, the regulators promulgated guidance and implemented regulations over a four-year period between 1996 and 1999. According to a statement in September 1999 from then-Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke, Jr., the effort consisted of the following actions13: First, we rigorously studied the likely impact of Y2K on the banking system and we calculated what it would take to prepare for it. Second, we looked at our own internal systems and earmarked the necessary resources to bring them to a state of readiness. Third -- and perhaps most important -- we began working with the financial institutions we supervise to heighten their awareness and encourage them to move with all due haste toward Y2K solutions of their own. We encouraged, we supported, and we cajoled. Through the FFIEC, we issued more than 20 interagency policy statements, dealing with such things as testing, contingency planning, customer awareness, and more. We even took enforcement actions in those cases where it seemed warranted. Leading up to the year 2000, bank examiners conducted Y2K-related examinations multiple times - between 2-4 times for each insured financial institution - and continued to oversee the largest banks. By September 1999, 99.7 percent of all federally supervised financial institutions had finished renovating and testing their systems -- “not just the systems that house their records and run their elevators, but the systems that bank customers rely upon for access to their funds.”14 Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 26
The FFIEC agencies also developed educational content such as videos and brochures for financial institutions to use in communicating to their customers the measures taken to ensure customer funds were safe.15 Comptroller Hawke detailed the steps the FFIEC had taken to Congress in April 1999 and said the interagency coordination consisted of16: ● Developing and disseminating detailed policy guidance to supervised institutions; ● Training and deploying examiners to conduct three or more onsite examinations of each institution; ● Setting up systems to track and monitor progress; ● Establishing and implementing vigorous enforcement programs to deal with deficiencies; ● Coordinating with other government agencies as well as private enterprises, domestically and internationally, to share valuable Year 2000-related information; ● Conducting numerous outreach programs to educate banks and the public; and ● Helping to organize and participating in a series of interagency contingency planning groups to plan for the orderly resolution of problems or issues that may arise either systemically or with individual banks. The FFIEC published guidance documents on the following topics and published an interim rule, which became final one year later, on Y2K-related safety and soundness standards for financial institutions. Guidance: ● The Effect of Year 2000 on Computer Systems (June 1996); ● Year 2000 Project Management Awareness (May 5, 1997); ● Safety and Soundness Guidelines Concerning the Year 2000 Business Risk (December 17, 1997) ● Guidance Concerning Institution Due Diligence in Connection with Service Provider and Software Vendor Year 2000 Readiness (March 17, 1998); ● Guidance Concerning the Year 2000 Impact on Customers (March 17, 1998); ● Guidance Concerning Testing for Year 2000 Readiness (April 10, 1998); ● Guidance Concerning Contingency Planning in Connection with Year 2000 Readiness (May 13, 1998); ● Guidance on Year 2000 Customer Awareness Programs (May 13, 1998); Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 27
● Customer Brochure on Year 2000 (July 6, 1998); ● Year 2000 Phase II Workprogram (July 8, 1998); ● Answers to Commonly Asked Y2K Questions (August 31, 1998); ● Frequently Asked Y2K Questions on Contingency Planning (December 11, 1998); ● Additional Year 2000 Guidance on Customer Communications (February 17, 1999); and ● Additional Y2K Questions on Contingency Planning (May 6, 1999). Deep Dive into Interagency Action on Y2K On June 17, 1996, the FFIEC issued its first interagency joint statement on the potential effect of Y2K on computer systems to the CEOs of all federally supervised financial institutions, senior management of each FFIEC agency, and all examining personnel.17 The joint statement cautioned that the two digit field ""00"" in the year 2000 that would replace “99” in records would be recognized as the year 1900, which would create erroneous data or cause a system failure based on incorrect calculations. The potential impact of Y2K could have affected “all forms of financial accounting (including interest computation, due dates, pensions, personnel benefits, investments, legal commitments)” and “record keeping, such as inventory, maintenance, and file retention.” The joint statement urged examinations to “review all aspects of computer systems to include those provided by service bureaus, hardware vendors, and other software vendors.” It stated that management must ensure: ● External vendors and servicers are addressing adequately the system and software issues related to Y2K; and ● In the event external vendors are unable to achieve the requirements, institutions have taken the steps needed to continue critical operations. The joint statement also outlined the following plan for financial institutions to mitigate Y2K- related risk: I. Establish a Year 2000 Team Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 28
A. Management should consider utilizing both internal and external information systems and audit resources to ensure that a risk-based Year 2000 Action Plan is developed. B. An inventory of all computer operating systems, applications and files should be created. All those with year 2000 issues must be identified. II. Develop an Institution Wide Year 2000 Plan A. The initial step in developing the plan should be to consider whether current systems and files should be modified, replaced, outsourced, or discontinued. It should be noted that even if new systems are purchased, old files may still have to be modified. (All computer systems, including mainframes, personal computers, local area networks, etc., should be considered). B. The year 2000 plan should also identify and prioritize applications and processes that are the most date sensitive and those which are most vulnerable. Interdependent applications should be grouped together. C. Management and the board of directors need to ensure that adequate funds and resources are allocated so that all year 2000 projects are completed in a timely manner. III. Year 2000 Plan Implementation A. Initiate pilot projects to test solutions to identified problems. It may be feasible to work with more than one vendor in order to evaluate their various solutions/capabilities before making a final decision. B. Begin the process of systematically implementing year 2000 changes by priority in accordance to risk. These projects should be conducted within the framework of the system development life cycle process currently in place. C. Conduct post implementation reviews to ensure the integrity and functionality of the modified systems. Interagency communications developed through the FFIEC were transmitted through the federal regulators to examiners and the financial institutions they supervised. The OCC relied on advisory letters to transmit the information, the Fed, FDIC, and Office of Thrift Supervision Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 29
(OTS) used press releases, and the NCUA used letters to supervised institutions to relay the information. On May 5, 1997, the FFIEC issued a second statement that set out a project management process strongly encouraging federally insured depository institutions to complete an inventory of core computer functions and outline priorities for Y2K goals by September 30, 1997. The statement provides that the “five management phases necessary to complete a computer conversion program are: awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation.” Banks were expected to largely complete programming changes and have testing underway for mission critical systems by December 31, 1998. The statement included in an appendix a questionnaire from the FFIEC Task Force on Supervision to help regulatory agencies conduct assessments of financial institutions’ planning efforts.18 Regulators used the results of these assessments to determine which supervisory reviews to prioritize based on examination procedures included in a second appendix to the statement. Conversion efforts were expected to be completed by mid-1998. In 1998, the FFIEC agencies also began supervising for Y2K-related risk for service providers and vendors in examinations, and they included risk analysis on a quarterly basis.19 In February 1998, the OTS began publishing a monthly newsletter for the agency’s 750 examiners and 1200 thrift institutions it supervised.20 Content included summaries of its findings from off-site examinations related to Y2K and the key OTS staff contacts for Y2K-related matters. In May and October 1998, the FFIEC hosted seminars for risk management planning that included as agenda items managing the risks of emerging technologies and Y2K concerns.21 On August 31, 1998, the FFIEC issued the first of three FAQs and answers (the FAQs) regarding Y2K.22 The FAQs focused on testing, documentation, and the FFIEC report distribution process. They also covered the following topics: ● Clarification of FFIEC policy concerning the types of testing documentation that Financial institutions should retain; ● Expectations regarding software and operating system upgrades in 1999; ● Conversions to new mission-critical systems in 1999; and ● Procedures for regulators to examine service providers and software vendors.

On October 15, 1998, the FFIEC agencies published joint interim guidelines to adopt Y2K safety and soundness standards. The guidelines were implemented as a final rule the following year on November 29, 1999 with minimal changes.23 The standards focused on the following topics: ● Review of mission-critical systems for Year 2000 readiness; ● Renovation of internal mission-critical systems; ● Renovation of external mission-critical systems; ● Testing of mission-critical systems; ● Business resumption contingency planning; ● Remediation contingency planning; ● Customer risk; and ● Involvement of the board of directors and management. On December 11, 1998, the FFIEC published its second FAQ resource regarding contingency planning that supplemented the previous FAQs and clarified expectations for completing remediation and business resumption contingency plans.24 On May 6, 1999, the FFIEC published additional answers to three Y2K FAQs regarding contingency planning. On July 6, 1999, the FFIEC released guidance on Y2K-related fraud prevention.25 The guidance encouraged institutions to enhance internal controls and security procedures and to communicate with customers about how to protect against Y2K-related fraudulent schemes. It also issued a consumer advisory for financial institutions’ customers regarding Y2k-related fraud. On June 9, 1999, the FDIC adopted an interim final rule that required certain FDIC-insured banks to implement asset and liability backup programs so that financial records would be preserved in case it suffered a Y2K-related problem and had to be placed in receivership.26 The rule applied to FDIC-insured banks that scored less than “satisfactory” in their Y2K ratings on or after July 31, 1999. Following the transition from 1999 to 2000, the FFIEC published on March 21, 2000, a document detailing the lessons learned from its Y2K-related preparation. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 31
The FFIEC stated that it believed the institutions that were best prepared possessed most or all of the following 10 characteristics: ● Senior management and director involvement to ensure that the project plans were clearly defined, supported and monitored; ● Consolidation, elimination or integration of technology on an enterprise-wide basis by developing current inventories of information technology systems and applications; ● Improved oversight of service providers, software vendors and consultants; ● More formalized and effective strategies and standards for testing information technology systems; ● Detailed contingency plans that analyzed the effect of potential system failures on core business processes (e.g., deposit taking, lending, fiduciary services, etc.); ● Better safeguards to detect fraudulent, malicious, and negligent acts from both internal and external sources; ● Review of testing and contingency planning processes by internal auditors; ● Open information sharing for developing strategies and to respond to media reports or perceptions that could reduce public confidence in the financial services industry; ● Improved public relations with customers; and ● Thorough legal review to assist in vendor management, documentation retention, and legal defense. Cybersecurity Assessment Tool The FFIEC developed its risk assessment tool for cyber risk less than one year after recognizing cybersecurity as a priority. When he assumed the chairmanship of the FFIEC, Comptroller Curry announced cybersecurity as his top priority. On June 24, 2014, the FFIEC launched a dedicated page on cybersecurity to serve as a resource for financial institutions and examiners. The FFIEC stated27: While information security has been a core focus of supervision for decades, the FFIEC members are taking a number of steps to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks at financial institutions and the need to identify, assess, and mitigate these risks in light of the increasing volume and sophistication of cyber threats that pose risks to all industries in our society. The FFIEC Web page provides links to joint statements, webinars, and other information that may help financial institutions when thinking about the issue of cybersecurity. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 32
It also launched a pilot program at over 500 community institutions to enable state and federal regulators to assess how the community institutions manage cybersecurity and mitigate cyber risks. In their assessments, regulators focused on: risk management and oversight; threat intelligence and collaboration; cybersecurity controls; service provider and vendor risk management; and cyber incident management and resilience. The pilot also served to help regulators enhance supervisory programs’ effectiveness, guidance, and examiner training. Within four months, on November 3, 2014, the FFIEC published general observations from its cybersecurity assessment pilot, including findings regarding inherent risks of cybersecurity and institution preparedness.28 Following the publication of its observations from its cybersecurity pilot, the FFIEC outlined its cybersecurity priorities for the remainder of 2015 on March 17, 2015.29 The priorities included establishing seven workstreams, including a workstream on developing and issuing a self- assessment tool for financial institutions to use in evaluating their cybersecurity preparedness and respond to cyber threats. The seven workstreams focused on the following topics30: ● Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Tool—The FFIEC plans to issue a self- assessment tool this year to assist institutions in evaluating their inherent cybersecurity risk and their risk management capabilities. ● Incident Analysis—FFIEC members will enhance their processes for gathering, analyzing, and sharing information with each other during cyber incidents. ● Crisis Management—The FFIEC will align, update, and test emergency protocols to respond to system-wide cyber incidents in coordination with public-private partnerships. ● Training—The FFIEC will develop training programs for the staff of its members on evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities. ● Policy Development—The FFIEC will update and supplement its Information Technology Examination Handbook to reflect rapidly evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities with a focus on risk management and oversight, threat intelligence and collaboration, cybersecurity controls, external dependency management, and incident management and resilience. ● Technology Service Provider Strategy—The FFIEC’s members will expand their focus on technology service providers’ ability to respond to growing cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 33
● Collaboration with Law Enforcement and Intelligence Agencies—The FFIEC will build upon existing relationships with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to share information on the growing cybersecurity threats and response techniques. Shortly after, on June 30, 2015, the FFIEC released its Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT)31 to help institutions identify risks and assess cybersecurity readiness.32 The CAT was intended for use by financial institutions of all sizes and was designed to be dynamic so that it could be updated as threats, vulnerabilities, and operational environments became more sophisticated. It also served to help examiners in their assessments of cyber risk. The FFIEC published resources to encourage use of the CAT such as “an executive overview, a user’s guide, an online presentation explaining the Assessment, and appendices mapping the Assessment’s baseline maturity statements to the FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook, mapping all maturity statements to the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework, and providing a glossary of terms.”33 On October 26, 2016, the federal banking regulators - OCC, Fed, and FDIC - published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to enhance cyber risk management standards for large and interconnected entities under their supervision and the entities’ service providers.34 The ANPR covered the following topics: cyber risk governance; cyber risk management; internal dependency management; external dependency management; and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Meanwhile, the FFIEC updated the CAT in 2017 to address changes to the FFIEC IT Examination Handbook and provide additional response options and practices and processes that represented the practices of the institution in supporting its cybersecurity activity assessment.35 The ANPR has not yet come to fruition as a proposed or final rule, however, in March 2020, the Fed was expecting further action on the enhanced standards.36 Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 34
Appendix B - OCC Innovation-Related Risk Case Study The Evolving Discussion of Financial Innovation-Related Risk In its first Semiannual Risk Perspective, published in Fall 2012, the OCC identified risk associated with financial innovation in the context of banks’ Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) obligations and expanded its focus as financial innovation accelerated in the mid-to-late 2010s. Consideration of financial innovation-related risk continued to build with the agency detailing for examiners supervision areas in operational, strategic, and reputation risk. The Spring 2019 Semiannual Risk Perspective featured innovation-related risk as a “Special Topic in Emerging Risk”. The agency’s focus continued this past year as innovation- related risk from digitization and e-commerce increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Below is a timeline summarizing the OCC’s discussion of such risks in its Semiannual Risk Perspective: ● 2012-2014 - discussion of compliance risk in the context of BSA/AML compliance; ● 2014 - Spring 2019 - expanded risk discussion beyond compliance risk to include strategic, operational, and reputation risk. The OCC continued to elaborate on these risks until financial innovation-related risk was highlighted as a Special Topic in Emerging Risk in Spring 2019; ● Fall 2019 - coverage of financial innovation-related risk was reduced to a brief discussion regarding operational and strategic risk; and ● Spring 2020 - Spring 2021 - discussion of risk increased based on increase in digitization due to COVID-19 pandemic. The first Semiannual Risk Perspective was published in Fall 2012 and flagged as a consideration for compliance risk challenges regarding BSA/AML “evolving money laundering schemes and technological developments.” The OCC continued to include technological developments as a compliance risk within the context of BSA/AML until Spring 2014, when it said, “[s]taff reviews will include applicable compliance, legal, and reputation risks posed by new products and services and emerging technologies, in particular, those that introduce higher compliance or reputation risk.” It also stated, “as part of their strategy to deal with competitive Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 35
pressures and lower overhead expenses, banks are leveraging technology such as cloud computing and mobile banking, which can increase exposure to additional technological risk.” As the OCC further considered new fintech innovations, it updated its Semiannual Risk Perspective to discuss their supervision. For example, in Fall 2015, the Semiannual Risk Perspective discussed BSA/AML risk arising from virtual currencies, and in Spring 2016, the OCC highlighted as operational risk bank competition with nonbanks and fintechs and increasing reliance on third-party relationships. This trend continued until it culminated in the Spring 2019 Semiannual Risk Perspective as a Special Topic in Emerging Risk where the significant increase in financial innovation was detailed and risks were dissected. For example, the report covers the following topics: strategic risk and challenges many banks face; changes in the federal banking industry; operational efficiency as a challenge for small banks; implications for the federal banking industry; and corporate governance and risk management. The Fall 2019 Semiannual Risk Perspective, on the other hand, touched on the strategic and operational risks of financial innovation. In 2020, the OCC renewed its focus on financial innovation, likely caused by significant shifts towards digitization and e-commerce, bank adoption of new and innovative products and payment mechanisms, and bank partnerships with third parties. These topics have continued to be a focus through the most recently published Semiannual Risk Perspective in Spring 2021. As the OCC elaborated on financial innovation risk in its Semiannual Risk Perspective in the mid-2010s, it also began highlighting these risks in its Bank Supervision Operating Plans as follows: For FY 2016, “the rapid pace of technological change” was identified as a focus area for Large Bank and Midsize and Community Bank (MCB) supervision in the context of AML/CFT compliance. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 36
For FY 2017, Large Bank supervision included compliance related to change management for implementing new platforms and technologies. Large Banks and MCBs supervision would continue to include technological change for compliance risk. For FY 2018, Mid-size and Community Bank supervision included operational risks associated with third-party relationships and introducing new or revised business products, processing platforms, and delivery channels. The 2018 operating plan also tasked the Compliance and Community Affairs unit within the Committee on Bank Supervision to supervise third-party relationship risk and assess compliance with BSA/AML to address risks from “evolving vulnerabilities resulting from the rapid pace of technological change, and emerging payment solutions and terrorist financing.” No discussion of financial innovation in the 2019 Operating Plan. For FY 2020, the Operating Plan was abbreviated to include priority objectives for supervisory units across the agency. One of the eight key risk areas identified is, “[t]echnological innovation and implementation, including use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, digitalization in risk management processes, new products and services, and strategic plans.” For FY 2021, three of the 13 key risk areas identified are: ● Proper oversight of significant third-party relationships, including partnerships. Examiners should identify where those relationships represent significant concentrations in operations, bank resiliency, or other risks. Examiners should assess risk oversight of third party’s own management of cybersecurity and resilience risks. ● Change management over significant operational changes. Examiners should evaluate governance over new technology innovation and implementation, including use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, digitalization in risk management processes, new products and services, and notable changes in strategic plans. Examiners will also focus on change management over emergency programs in response to the pandemic including the CARES Act and pandemic-related operating conditions. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 37
● Payment systems products and services, currently offered or planned, focusing on new or novel products, services, or channels for wholesale and retail customer relationships. Examiners should consider potential risks including operational, compliance, strategic and reputation and how these risks are incorporated into institution-wide risk assessments and new product review processes. For FY 2022, the OCC will supervise for the following three of the 11 key risk areas identified: ● Third parties and related concentrations: Examiners should determine whether banks are providing proper oversight of their significant third-party relationships, including partnerships. Examiners should identify where those relationships are critical to bank operations and understand whether they represent significant concentrations or impact resiliency. Examiners should also be aware of the cyber-related risks emanating from third parties and evaluate the bank assessments of the third party’s cybersecurity risk management and resilience capabilities. ● Payments: Examiners should evaluate payment systems products and services that banks offer or plan to offer, with a focus on new or novel products, services, or channels for wholesale and retail customer relationships. Examiners should consider potential risks including operational, compliance, strategic, credit, and reputation and how these risks are incorporated into institution-wide risk assessments and new product review processes, if applicable. ● Fintech/Cryptocurrency: Examiners should identify banks that are implementing significant changes in their operations using new technological innovations and evaluate implementation, including use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digitalization in the risk management processes. Examiners should evaluate the appropriateness of governance processes when banks undertake significant changes. Continuing its focus on financial innovation, in August 2021, the OCC, along with the Fed and FDIC, published guidance for community banks, “Conducting Due Diligence on Financial Technology Companies: A Guide for Community Banks.” The guide elaborates on six key due diligence topics: business experience and qualifications; financial condition; legal and regulatory compliance; risk management and controls; information security; and operational resilience. The Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 38
guide contains relevant considerations, potential sources of information, and illustrative examples to aid community banks. The OCC also published in March 2020 frequently asked questions (FAQs) to supplement previous OCC bulletins published on managing risk from third-party relationships. The FAQs include information on topics such as: ■ When cloud computing providers are in a third-party relationship with a bank; ■ When data aggregators are in a third-party relationship with a bank; and ■ The type of due diligence and ongoing monitoring that should be applied to fintechs, startups, and small businesses. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 39","Ceres, a nonprofit organization focused on climate change, submitted comments on the OCC's proposed principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. Ceres supports the OCC's initiative and suggests that the principles should apply to all banks, not just those with over $100 billion in assets, as climate risks affect banks of all sizes. They recommend using a $50 billion threshold, aligning with existing risk management guidelines. Ceres emphasizes the systemic financial risks posed by climate change, citing recent climate disasters and their economic impacts. They advocate for mandatory, rather than voluntary, adoption of these principles, similar to actions by European regulators. Ceres also suggests developing a climate risk assessment tool, akin to the FFIEC's Cybersecurity Assessment Tool, to help banks manage climate risks. They highlight the need for banks to consider climate risks in lending and investment decisions and to develop strategies for managing transition and physical risks. Ceres calls for enhanced regulatory reporting and stress testing to include climate risks and recommends that banks engage with clients on climate strategies. They also stress the importance of considering the impacts on low-income and disadvantaged communities and suggest incorporating climate resilience into the Community Reinvestment Act."

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am the Chief Risk Officer at Heartland Bank, a $1.5 billion community bank headquartered in Whitehall,  Ohio, and I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions.  Heartland bank exemplifies  the true meaning of a community bank. Our commercial lending focuses on our communities, lending  within niche markets, and helping start-ups get off the ground. We understand that when we lend to  businesses in our communities it strengthens our neighborhoods, provides jobs, revitalizes the  economy, and results in money going back into those same neighborhoods allowing them to prosper. I  am concerned that the proposed framework for managing climate-related financial risk management for  large banks will negatively impact the communities we serve.  As a community bank, we have a long  history of managing risk, including concentration risk and natural disasters, within our lending and  investment portfolios. Additional regulation is unnecessary for us to manage our climate related  financial risk. Our bank has long-standing and prudent underwriting and insurance practices that  sufficiently address climate risk and should not be overly burdened with duplicative and unnecessary  regulation that is aimed at larger and more complex institutions. Unlike large banks, we are not a  systemic risk to the financial system and should not be subjected to a one size fits all climate related risk  management framework. On January 1, 2023, we will be adopting CECL and will already be more  concerned about reflecting future risks, including climate related risk, in our loan loss reserve.  In  addition to the burden a required climate risk management framework would cause for community  banks is the concern related to the cost of such requirements like scenario analysis. Scenario analysis is a  complex process for which we would have to find a third-party consultant to perform, and which will  provide little value for the cost of a consultant as we are already familiar with our concentration risks. It  would also be difficult to gather climate data from our customers, and we are already stress testing our  loan portfolio.  Community banks have long been managing risks across the institution, including climate  related risks. We do not need the burden of additional regulation to interfere with the value we provide  our communities. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the statement of principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions.    Jennifer Eckert   Johnstown, OH","Jennifer Eckert, Chief Risk Officer at Heartland Bank, expresses concerns about the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework for large financial institutions. She argues that such regulations are unnecessary for community banks like Heartland, which already manage risks, including climate-related ones, through prudent underwriting and insurance practices. Eckert emphasizes that community banks are not systemic risks and should not be subjected to the same regulations as larger banks. She highlights the potential burden and cost of compliance, such as scenario analysis, which would require hiring third-party consultants. Eckert asserts that community banks are already familiar with their concentration risks and conduct stress testing, making additional regulations redundant. She concludes by stating that these regulations could interfere with the value community banks provide to their communities."

While banks publicly claim to be phasing out financing for fossil fuel extraction, financial reports show that they continue to pour billions into fossil fuel companies. For example, JP Morgan Chase has provided more than a quarter trillion dollars to the fossil fuel industry since the signing of the Paris Agreement.  Regulators of banks are responsible for protecting the stability of the economy and  therefore must require banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the damage banks cause through their deliberate financing of the companies causing climate disaster.

Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment criticizes banks for their role in financing the fossil fuel industry, which contributes to climate change. Despite public claims of reducing fossil fuel financing, banks like JP Morgan Chase continue to invest heavily in these industries. The commenter urges regulators to enforce stricter climate-related risk management in banks, including integrating climate risk into business operations, planning for long-term climate impacts, and ensuring internal strategies align with public climate commitments. The commenter supports proposed guidance for banks to manage climate risks and suggests that banks' climate risk management should influence their supervisory ratings. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is called upon to issue strong guidance and enforce remedies to ensure banks act to minimize climate risk, benefiting both the public and the banks."
140,kze-u7qm-xkdu,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks’ continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429    Re: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions [RIN 3064-ZA32]    Via comments@fdic.gov     Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am pleased to provide these comments in response to the release by the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of its draft “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial  Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.”1    General Comments    Section 1(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act reads:    (a)  Establishment of Corporation.--There is hereby established a Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the ""Corporation"") which shall insure,  as hereinafter provided, the deposits of all banks and savings associations which are  entitled to the benefits of insurance under this Act, and which shall have the powers  hereinafter granted. (emphasis added)    The FDIC mission statement reads:    The mission of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is to maintain stability  and public confidence in the nation's financial system. In support of this goal, the FDIC:    • Insures deposits,  • Examines and supervises financial institutions for safety and soundness  and consumer protection,  • Works to make large and complex financial institutions resolvable, and  • Manages receiverships.2    There is nothing in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the FDIC mission statement about  climate change, curing cancer or a hundred other worthy objectives.    1 Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions” Notice  of Proposed Policy Statement; Request for Comment, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Register, Vol.  87, No. 64, April 4, 2022, pp. 19507-19512 https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-04-04/pdf/2022- 07065.pdf.   2 What We Do, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation https://www.fdic.gov/about/what-we-do/index.html.  
  “Climate-related” financial risks are only relevant to the FDIC’s actual mission if they are  material to the safety and soundness of the supervised banks. As a factual matter, climate- related risks are generally not material to the safety and soundness of banks. Constant repetition  by regulators and politicians that they are does not make it so. But to the extent climate-related  financial risks are actually financially material and determinable, current laws and  regulations require that those risks be addressed. There is no need for additional rules.     Indeed, virtually the entire “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions ” document reads as if Part 364 of Title 12 of the  Code of Federal Regulations (relating to Safety and Soundness) and section 20.1 of the Risk  Management Manual of Examination Policies (relating to “Risk-Focused, Forward-Looking  Safety and Soundness Supervision”)3 were summarized and then the words “climate-related  financial” were inserted in front of the word “risk” wherever it occurred.     There is no legitimate reason to single out climate-related risks for special treatment as compared  to the hundreds of other types of material risk – risks that usually more important. If the FDIC  stays in its lane and only addresses climate-related financial risks that are actually material and  determinable under current bank supervision principles, then such an approach will do relatively  little damage. There is good reason to believe, however, that is not what is really going on.     What is going on is submission to political demands from the White House to weaponize  financial regulation in furtherance of progressive political objectives4 and to use bank  supervision to allocate credit toward favored industries and away from disfavored industries.   Attempting to further progressive political and social objectives unrelated to the FDIC’s actual  mission will make any such regulation economically suspect and may well result in a court  holding that the FDIC does not have the statutory authority to promulgate the regulation. FDIC  attempts to circumvent the Administrative Procedure Act by the use of guidance or “principles”   documents, examinations and enforcement actions will be similarly suspect.     Before this guidance document becomes the basis for any enforcement action or any bank  examination, the FDIC needs to do the hard work of writing an Administrative Procedure Act  compliant rule providing notice and seeking public comment. If it does so, the points made in the  sections below regarding the complexity and deep ambiguity involved in undertaking the  “climate-related” risk assessment enterprise will become quite evident. The FDIC also needs to  seek OIRA clearance and, further, comply with Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork  Reduction Act, Executive Order No. 12866 and related executive orders. It should not seek to  evade the APA and other regulatory requirements by issuing guidance or principles documents  that are really rules and then moving immediately to enforcement of the rule masquerading as    3 See, for example, 12 CFR §364.101 et. Seq. https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part- 364; “Risk-Focused, Forward-Looking Safety and Soundness Supervision,” Section 20.1, Risk Management Manual  of Examination Policies https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/section20-1.pdf.  4 See especially, “Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” section 3, May 20, 2021  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related- financial-risk/. The Executive Order like the “Principles” document is almost entirely unsullied by citations to facts. 
guidance by means of the bank supervision process. These deficiencies may well lead to a  determination that the “Principles” are unlawful when subjected to judicial review.    Summary of the Problems with FDIC Regulation of “Climate-Related Financial Risk”    1. Additional Climate Change Requirements Would Impede the FDIC’s Important Mission. The  important mission of the FDIC is to ensure the safety and soundness of banks and to insure  deposits. Requirements relating to climate-related financial risk beyond those required under  existing requirements related to material risks would impede rather than further that mission. It  would affirmatively harm depositors, customers, bank shareholders, taxpayers, and the economy.    2. Requiring Banks to Devote Resources and Inappropriately Weight Immaterial Climate Change  “Risk” Will Increase Rather than Decrease Risk. Requiring banks to inappropriately weight  climate-related financial risks that are not actually material and to devote resources to risks that  are not actually material or determinable will reduce the focus on, and weight given to, risks that  actually are material. Banks are likely to distort their risk assessments to satisfy a politicized  FDIC. To the extent that banks begin focusing on immaterial or lesser “climate-related” risks out  of concern for satisfying politicized regulators, instead of focusing on real, material risks, the  risks borne by the financial system will increase, not decrease.    3. Climate Models and Climate Science are Highly Uncertain. There is a massive amount of  variance among various climate models and uncertainty regarding the future of the climate.      I am no climate science expert. Nor, I suspect, is anyone at the FDIC since climate science is  way outside of the FDIC’s lane. I do know a thing or two about modeling in an economics  context. Models are typically highly dependent on a few relationships specified in their equations  and parameters. A small number of assumptions about relationships and parameters drive results.  For example, a model examining the impact of proposed tax policy might adopt a neoclassical  view where the impact of the proposed tax changes on the user cost of capital and labor response  are central (as specified in the equations) and the empirical parameters (as specified in the  elasticities) governing investment and labor are key.5 Seemingly small adjustments to elasticities  (even though within the bounds established in the empirical literature) result is significantly  different results. A Keynesian “macroeconomic” approach focusing on aggregate demand would  yield dramatically different results, operate on different principles and lead to different policy  recommendations. And so on.    Climate modeling is, in principle, no different. A small number of equations and empirical  parameters drive results. Even the conventional governmental source -- the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change – shows massive variations in projections and shows the wide  divergence in the ability of models to account for past warming6 and the degree of warming that    5 Parker Sheppard and David Burton, “How the GOP Tax Bill Will Affect the Economy,” Daily Signal, November  17, 2017 https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/11/17/gop-tax-bill-will-affect-economy/. In this case, we used the Hall- Jorgenson user cost of capital equation, the Cobb-Douglas production function and conventional price theoretic  labor market modeling.    6 See, for instance, Byron A. Steinman, Michael E. Mann and Sonya K. Miller, “Atlantic and Pacific Multidecadal  Oscillations and Northern Hemisphere Temperatures,” Science, February 27, 2015, Vol. 347, Issue 6225, pp 988- 991, https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6225/988#aff-1 and Joseph Majkut, “Climbing the Staircase of 
is anthropogenic.7 The worst-case concentration pathway, for example, assumes unlikely   projections regarding coal usage, high population growth, low economic growth and slow  technological progress.8 Using the worst-case scenario of these emissions concentration  pathways as the business-as-usual scenario will mislead the private sector, policymakers, and  regulators on the estimated climate impacts and costs.9 In fact, in a normal financial context, the  use of such a model with such assumptions would be regarded as fraudulent.    Once you broaden your reading to include those that do not have a financial or political interest  in climate change alarmism, it becomes clear that the variance and uncertainty in climate  modeling is even higher than the IPCC report indicates.10 It is clear that various models yield  dramatically different results. Explaining the details of these dramatic differences in model  outcomes is beyond the scope of this letter and my current competence. It is also beyond the  ability of the FDIC and its bank examiners.    4. Economic Modeling of Climate Change Effects is Even More Uncertain. There is an even  higher degree of variance and uncertainty associated with attempts to model or project the  economic impact of highly divergent and uncertain climate models. Any estimate of the  economic impact of climate change would have to rely on highly uncertain and divergent climate  model results discussed above. In addition to this high degree of uncertainty would be added an  entirely new family of economic ambiguity and uncertainty. Any economic estimate of the  impact of climate change would also have to choose a discount rate to arrive at the present  discounted value of future costs and benefits of climate change and to estimate the future costs  and benefits of various regulatory or private responses. The choice of discount rate is  controversial and important.

climate change (sea level rises, the impact on agriculture, etc.). Estimates would need to be made  of the cost of various remediation techniques. Guesses would need to be made about the rate of  technological change. Guesses would need to be made about the regulatory, tax and other  responses of a myriad of governments. Estimates would need to be made using conventional  economic techniques regarding the economic impact of those changes which, in turn, would  reflect a wide variety of techniques and in many cases a thin or non-existent empirical literature.  Guesses would need to be made of market responses to all of these changes since market  participants will not stand idly by and do nothing as markets and the regulatory environment  change.     Then, after making decisions regarding all of these extraordinarily complex, ambiguous and  uncertain issues, banks would then need to assess the likely impact of climate change on their  specific business years into the future – a business that may by then bear little resemblance to its  existing business. Then, the FDIC would need to assess the accuracy of the banks “risk  assessment” based on this speculative house of cards. The idea that all of this can be done in a  way that will meaningfully improve the regulation of the safety and soundness of banks is not  credible.    5. The FDIC Does Not Possess the Expertise to Competently Assess Climate Models or the  Economic Impact of Climate Change. The FDIC has neither the expertise to assess climate  models nor the expertise to assess economic models purporting to project the economic impact of  divergent and uncertain climate projections.    6. The FDIC Has Neither the Expertise nor the Administrative Ability to Assess the Accuracy of  Banks’ Climate Change Risk Assessments. The FDIC does not have the expertise or  administrative ability to assess the accuracy, or lack thereof, of banks’ “climate change risk  assessments” based on bank-specific speculation regarding the impact of climate change which  would be based on bank-specific choices regarding highly divergent and uncertain economic  models projecting the economic impact of climate changes based on bank-specific choices  regarding highly divergent and uncertain climate models.    7. FDIC Resources Are Better Spent Furthering Its Mission. Imposing these requirements and  developing the expertise to police such climate change risk assessment, even if limited to large  banks, will involve the expenditure of very substantial resources. If the FDIC ever extends these  rules to the roughly 3,100 supervised institutions, the expenditure by the FDIC would be  mammoth. These resources would be much better spent furthering the FDIC’s actual mission.    8. The Costs Imposed on Regulated Entities Would be Large. Requiring regulated entities to  develop climate modeling expertise, the ability to make macroeconomic projections based on  these models and then make firm-specific economic assessments based on these climate and  economic models will be expensive, imposing costs that will amount to hundreds of millions of  dollars (if limited to large banks) and billions of dollars if generalized. These expenses must be  recovered by the banks one way or another. They would harm investors by reducing shareholder  returns or customers by increasing costs (to borrowers) or returns (to depositors or other lenders).    
9. If these Rules are Generalized to Apply to All Banks, Climate Change Risk Assessment  Requirements Would Further Reduce the Attractiveness of Forming a New Bank and Have a  Disproportionate Adverse Impact on Small Banks. Regulatory requirements imposed on large  banks have a way of eventually being imposed on all banks. The large bank requirement is a trial  run, a pilot program if you will. Regulatory costs do not increase linearly with size. The cost of  creating a climate change risk assessment model is not much greater for a large bank than for a  small one. And so on. Imposing comparable costs on small banks as large banks will make them  less competitive since the costs must be spread over a smaller customer base.    10. Climate Change Risk Assessment Requirements Would Create a New Compliance Eco- System and a New Lobby to Retain the Requirements. The imposition of such requirements  would result in the creation of a new compliance eco-system and pro-complexity lobby  composed of the economists, accountants, attorneys and compliance officers that live off of the  new requirements. This is already starting to happen.11    11. Banking Laws are a Poor Mechanism to Address Externalities. Externalities, such as  pollution, should be addressed by either enhancing property rights or, in the case of unowned  resources such as the air and waterways, by a regulatory response that carefully assesses the  costs and benefits of the regulatory response. Banking safety and soundness regulation is the  wrong place to try to address externalities. Policing externalities is far outside of the scope of  FDIC’s mission and the purpose of the banking laws.    12. Efforts to Redefine Materiality or the Broader Purpose of Business should be Opposed. There  is a major push to redefine what is deemed material for securities regulation purposes. This  “Principles” document is the beginning of a similar push with respect to determining what is  material risk in banking regulation.     Simply because some politically motivated investors seek to impose a disclosure requirement on  issuers, for example, does not make such a requirement material. The effort to redefine  materiality in the securities laws (and now banking) is part of an increasingly strident effort to  redefine the purpose of businesses more generally to achieve various social or political  objectives unrelated to earning a return, satisfying customers, or treating workers or suppliers  fairly. This is being done under the banner of social justice; corporate social responsibility  (CSR); stakeholder theory; environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria; socially  responsible investing (SRI); sustainability; diversity; business ethics; common-good capitalism;  or corporate actual responsibility. The social costs of ESG and broader efforts to repurpose  business firms will be considerable. Wages will decline or grow more slowly, firms will be less  productive and less internationally competitive, investor returns will decline, innovation will  slow, goods and services quality will decline and their prices will increase.       11 Jean Eaglesham, “Wall Street’s Green Push Exposes New Conflicts of Interest: Auditors, Bond Raters and Others  Aim to Profit by Both Judging and Advising Companies on their ESG Scores,” Wall Street Journal, January 29,  2022. See also external cost estimate at PRA Table 4 at p. 21461 of “The Enhancement and Standardization of  Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,” Securities and Exchange Commission, Proposed Rule, Federal Register,  Vol. 87, No. 69, April 11, 2022, pp. 21334-21473  https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-04-11/pdf/2022- 06342.pdf.  
Banking regulation risk assessments should be limited to those risks that impose a substantial,  material financial risk for banks. Period. Full stop. While climate-related risks can fall into that  category, they rarely do. And, more importantly, to the extent that they do, no additional  regulation is required. The current rules would cover material risks associated with climate  change.    The Social Costs of ESG    The broader social costs associated with ESG requirements can, in principle, be quantified. This  section provides an analytical framework that may be useful in analyzing the social welfare costs  of ESG requirements.     To the extent ESG objectives are not pursued by businesses for the purpose of making a profit, R  > RESG/CSR, where R is the rate of return on investment in the absence of ESG, CSR, sustainability  requirements, diversity requirements, or stakeholder theory implementation, and RESG/CSR is the  rate of return after implementation of those requirements. The difference, R - RESG/CSR, is  economically analogous to a tax. It is a reduction in return due to the pursuit of ESG objectives.  Thus, R - RESG/CSR = TaxESG/CSR. This means that various techniques used in public finance to  analyze the social welfare impact of taxes may be used to quantitatively analyze the social welfare  cost of these provisions (i.e., TaxESG/CSR).     A tax has an excess burden or deadweight loss that can be calculated.12 By introducing a wedge  (TaxESG/CSR) between, in this case, the gross return and the net return, ESG/CSR reduces the size  of the capital market and therefore output and employment. In a well-functioning market, the price  of a capital asset should be equal to the present value of the expected future income stream  generated by the asset net of taxes and depreciation.13 Introducing a new tax (in this case  TaxESG/CSR) would reduce the expected future income stream, and therefore, the price of the asset.  It would also cause investment to flow out of the affected sector or jurisdiction.     Who bears the actual economic burden of the corporate income tax is an open question.14 The  analysis of who bears the burden of TaxESG/CSR would be the same. One thing is certain: It cannot  be corporations. A corporation is a legal fiction, and legal fictions do not pay taxes—people pay    12Arnold C.

taxes. The corporate tax could be borne by corporate shareholders in the form of lower returns;15  owners of all capital (again in the form of lower returns);16 corporate customers in the form of  higher prices;17 or employees (in the form of lower wages).18 It is, almost certainly, some  combination of these.19 The economics profession has changed its thinking on this issue several  times over the past four decades, but the latest —and highly plausible —consensus is that workers  probably bear more than half of the burden of the corporate income tax because capital is highly  mobile.20 Labor’s share of the corporate tax burden is potentially as high as three-quarters.21    15Government estimators are among the few who cling to the view that shareholders bear most of the burden.

Shareholders (investors) probably bear most of the remainder.22 Initially (i.e., in the short run), the  impact on shareholder returns would be greater. Adjustments take time.

Specific Requests for Comment    Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its climate- related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile,  and scope of operations?    Answer 2: The FDIC has to move beyond simply making abstract demands on banks and do the  hard work of explaining how climate modeling, economic modeling, bank specific assessments  of climate relating risk, projections of future government policy and so forth can actually be  done to the FDIC’s satisfaction. There is, quite literally, nothing in the Principles document that  provides any meaningful guidance to banks about how to do these things.    Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft principles  into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with financial  institutions to understand those challenges?    Answer 3: As discussed above, the challenges are legion and the FDIC, while making inordinate  demands, has done nothing to address the actual problems that banks will face when they attempt  to comply with these demands. Banks will be forced to choose a climate model and choose an  economics model notwithstanding the enormous variance and uncertainty associated with these  models. They will then be forced to make a series of guesses built on speculation about the  impact on their bank and its customers based on those models and speculation about future  government policies and market responses. All with no meaningful guidance from the FDIC.    Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and  assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?    Answer 7: The proper answer to this question is that they should not consider a particular time  horizon but should appropriately discount the future so that costs far into the future will be  discounted and only be material if extremely large. As discussed above, the choice of discount  rate is extremely important.     Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better  capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?    Answer 12: The Securities Exchange Commission has proposed and will probably adopt climate  change disclosure requirements that will apply to these large banks (since they are all public  companies). The SEC has estimated that these rules will triple the cost of being a public  company (See PRA Table 4 in the proposing release). That is enough.      22As opposed to non-corporate capital and customers.

Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment emphasizes the critical role of the banking industry in addressing climate change, urging banks to prioritize climate protection over mere financial profits. It commends Comptroller Hsu for addressing climate change issues within banks. Despite public claims of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, banks are criticized for investing heavily in fossil fuel companies, exacerbating climate change and risking the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. The comment supports proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management, plan for long-term climate impacts, and align internal strategies with public climate commitments. It calls for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to ensure banks' actions align with their zero carbon emissions commitments and to incorporate climate risk management into supervisory ratings. The comment stresses the urgency for the OCC to issue strong guidance to mitigate climate risks and protect against unsafe banking practices."

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429    Submitted via email to comments@fdic.gov       RE:  Comments on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s “Statement of Principles  for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions”      Mr. Sheesley:    The American Public Gas Association (APGA) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments  in response to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) request for comment  pertaining to its draft “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Financial Institutions.”    APGA is the trade association for more than 730 communities across the U.S. that own and  operate their retail natural gas distribution entities.1  They include not-for-profit gas distribution  systems owned by municipalities and other local government entities, all locally accountable to  the citizens they serve.  Public gas systems focus on providing safe, reliable, affordable, and clean  energy to their customers and support their communities by delivering fuel to be used for  cooking, clothes drying, and space and water heating, as well as for various commercial and  industrial applications.    APGA supports goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.  As a cost-effective  and efficient energy source, consumers value the ability to choose natural gas as the solution  that works best for their budgets and lifestyles.  Given its growing domestic supply and the safe  and reliable delivery system reaching almost every home and business in America, the direct use  of natural gas in buildings is an important part of our country’s energy future.  In fact, natural gas  has been a big driver behind our country’s declines in carbon emissions. Notably, America’s gas    1 More information available at www.apga.org. 
2    utilities have added 30 million residential customers since 1970 with virtually no increases in  emissions.2    As energy providers, APGA member gas systems are environmental stewards, prioritizing  sustainability efforts, including using more renewable natural gas (RNG) and focusing on reducing  emissions, such as through enhanced leak detection.  As FDIC works to develop its climate-related  risk principles for large financial institutions, APGA urges the agency to ensure that communities  who rely on these banks can continue to leverage public utilities, especially the workforce and  existing assets. The men and women, who work for APGA’s members, and the infrastructure they  operate provides natural gas now and lower carbon fuels in the future, which broadly support  the Administration's climate goals.      Many of our members rely on large financial institutions to lend money that is then used for  capital intensive projects, such as implementing new leak detection technology or repairing aging  infrastructure.  Any policy statement that may lead to higher costs for APGA members to borrow  money for these projects, which would help to lower emissions, could ultimately hurt the  consumer.  Because community-owned natural gas utilities operate as not-for-profits, costs are  directly passed to the end user, meaning that a policy statement that too broadly discriminates  against an industry large financial institutions do business with might actually result in higher  utility bills for consumers, even in communities working to minimize emissions. FDIC’s actions  could even lead to setbacks for our country’s decarbonization goals.  Accordingly, APGA  encourages FDIC to develop a policy that does not make broad sweeping assumptions that would  result in higher banking costs for publicly-owned gas utilities.  Misguided policies that put all our  energy “eggs in one basket” by mandating electrification are not helpful, as they eliminate  Americans’ ability to choose the energy source best fit for their needs and budget.      * * *    APGA members play a critical role in delivering Americans the safe, reliable, affordable,  and clean  energy they need.  Accordingly, FDIC’s climate principles should not hinder communities,  especially those who own and operate their own natural gas utility, from continuing to leverage  the existing natural gas distribution workers and fuel delivery infrastructure to meet the climate  goals of the current Administration.

The Principles are intended to improve banks’ identification and  management of climate-related financial risks at banks with $100 billion in assets and above.  The Principles call for enhanced governance, strategic planning, risk management, oversight, and  data reporting practices for climate-related financial risks.   ABA and its members understand that climate change has implications for banks, their  counterparties and the communities banks serve.2 Overall, we support the Principles as a guide  for larger institutions, which are currently working to better understand their climate-related risks  and communicate the information and actions to regulators, investors and other stakeholders. We  reiterate the concerns and comments discussed in response to the BCBS and OCC’s proposed  principles,3 and emphasize the need for a tailored, principles-based approach until the data and  methodologies for understanding climate-related financial risk are more fully developed.                                                               1 The American Bankers Association is the voice of the nation’s $24 trillion banking industry, which is composed of  small, regional and large banks that together employ more than 2 million people, safeguard $19.9 trillion in  deposits and extend nearly $11.4 trillion in loans.    2 ABA has developed a set of principles guiding our advocacy on these issues:  https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/climate-change-and-banking   3 ABA comment letter to the OCC https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/clclimateocc20220214    ABA comment letter to the BCBS https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/clbcbs20220214   
    2    The largest banks are currently making significant investments in staffing, training, systems,  modeling and data collection to better assess and monitor their climate-related risks. As the  FDIC is aware, however, defining and quantifying climate change-related impacts on traditional  bank risks is a relatively new and complex process, with the assumptions backing the analyses  dependent on a vast number of policy choices and outcomes, over timeframes that extend far  beyond those used to assess traditional banking risks.   Given these uncertainties, and to accommodate what will likely be significant changes to the  practice of climate-related financial risk identification, we urge the FDIC to continue to take a  principles-based approach that is flexible and iterative—and that allows banks to assess the risks  they identify as the most material to their unique circumstances. Moreover, we urge the FDIC  not to expand the scope of the guidance to mid-size and community banks until more robust data  is available, and the climate-related financial risks and opportunities are better understood. This  does not mean that these risks are unmitigated, rather, that banks and other corporations are  being asked to identify and isolate new variables and concepts, such as exposure to transition  risks. Banks are well-practiced in adapting to and managing change in the business environment  and consumer and market preferences. Climate-related financial risks are naturally embedded  into this process through the dynamic market, economic, and counterparty data that are the  backbone of robust risk management. As the policy goals, definitions, and methodologies behind  climate-related financial risk identification evolve, banks of all sizes will continue to apply  traditional credit and financial risk tolerances and parameters to their balance sheets to manage  their risks and support the customers and communities they serve.   Prescriptive guidance or regulation based on today’s climate –related financial risk  assumptions would be premature   The largest banks are conducting climate specific qualitative assessments, developing internal  models, and incorporating forward-looking, climate-related considerations into strategy and new  business assessment. As a practical matter, however, the nascent stage of climate-related risk  assessment means that banks are in the earliest stages of exploring how to refine and adapt their  management of climate-related financial risks.   The risk management frameworks, systems, and metrics the largest banks use to manage  traditional bank risk are effective, well established, backed by deep and robust market and  economic data, and understood by bank boards and management, bank counterparties, investors,  supervisors, and other stakeholders. Climate-related financial risk assessment is not nearly as  well understood or developed. For example, there is an absence of robust market data related to  climate-related financial risk,a lack of standardized definitions surrounding what is meant by  climate-related risk, and limited information about how climate-related risk interacts with  traditional financial risks. For example, there is little information as yet on the risk of losses,  posed by climate change, the probability of default or loss given default or the making the  modeling necessary to identification extremely difficult. Together, these foundational gaps mean  that the processes, procedures and methodologies surrounding climate-related risk identification  and monitoring are in the earliest stages of development. It would be premature, then, to  implement prescriptive or quantitative based requirements with respect to climate related  financial risk, such as those related to risk limits and appetites.  Any future guidance should not  be so prescriptive as to require changes to existing - or creation of new - credit risk appetite and  lending limits, as a result of climate risk considerations 
    3    ABA believes that any future guidance or regulations should remain open ended with regulators   focused on ensuring that the largest banks are progressing in their capabilities and conducting  internal climate-related risk analysis calibrated to the risks material to their individual business  model. Over the near term, attaching regulatory consequences to climate-related risk exposures  would be premature. Additional regulation based on today’s capabilities could potentially result  in a misallocation of resources.   The FDIC should continue to tailor its climate-related guidance    ABA understands that banks of all sizes must identify, monitor, and manage their risks. We  support and appreciate the FDICs’ assurances that any forthcoming regulation will be tailored to  reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business  models, and we agree with this approach. As a general matter, banks of differing sizes and  complexity are engaged in different combinations of activities, which in turn present a wide  variety of risk profiles. This is also the case with climate-related financial risks, with the added  challenge of significant uncertainty around definitions, data, and the capacity to build necessary  systems and expertise.   As discussed above, many of the largest institutions are devoting significant resources to better  understand how to assess and integrate climate-related financial risks, while many smaller  institutions are still trying to determine if they have exposure based on current definitions, and if  so, what it may mean for their institution, their customers and their communities. Additionally,  smaller institutions rely on third parties for data and reporting, so they will need additional time  to quantify and assess their climate-related financial risks.   We recommend that the FDIC not apply this guidance to mid-sized and smaller institutions until  climate-related financial risk is more precisely identified and understood, and the methodologies  have evolved. Future supervisory expectations or further regulation will need to be calibrated for  smaller institutions, mitigating any negative impact on their communities.     Climate scenario analysis should be an internal and confidential supervisory process  We appreciate the FDIC’s distinction between “scenario analysis,” and “stress testing.” Scenario  analysis is typically a forward-looking assessment of a potential future state of the world over  time, resulting from a plausible and possibly adverse set of assumed events or sequence of  assumed events. Stress testing typically assesses the potential impacts of transitory shocks to  near-term economic and financial conditions. Stress testing usually has capital planning  implications, and refers to exercises, conducted by the Federal Reserve, that may have regulatory  consequences. “Climate scenario analysis” is a tool used to enhance critical strategic thinking  and inform strategic decision-making to assess business risks and opportunities against a range  of plausible future climate scenarios. To avoid confusion, we recommend that the FDIC provide  further clarity by using the term “climate scenario analysis” to connote an exploratory exercise  for banks’ assessment of the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities over short,  medium, and long-time horizons.   As part of their overall effort to better understand their climate-related financial risks, large  banks are developing climate-related scenario analysis based on their unique systems, risks, and  business models. Through this process, many banks are identifying key data and modeling gaps,  and they are evaluating external providers to find a work around for those identified gaps. We 
    4    recommend that until climate-related risks are better understood, and more market and economic  data is available, climate scenario analysis be performed using banks’ internal models and  processes.   The FDIC should ensure that banks can continue to serve their communities  Banks are a critical source of lending to retail and small business in communities across the  United States. The FDIC, together with the OCC, Federal Reserve and other agencies, should  ensure that any future guidance or regulations related to climate related financial risk allows  banks to continue providing loans and other financial services to the communities and customers  they currently serve.   ABA appreciates the question as to whether or not the banking agencies should, “modify existing  regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act, to  address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged  communities” While we will be submitting a detailed comment letter on the recently issued joint  agency proposal to modernize the Community Re-investment Act, we tentatively support  providing positive CRA consideration for certain loans and investments intended to address the  impacts of climate change, particularly as it relates to low- and moderate-income customers and  communities. We stand ready to work with the banking agencies to ensure that all communities  are supported.  The FDIC must continue to collaborate with the other banking agencies and financial  services regulators   An orderly and efficient progression forward dictates that the FDIC work in close conjunction  with the other U.S. banking and financial agencies and international standard setting bodies to  close data gaps and apply a consistent set of definitions, assumptions and methodologies.  Collaboration will also help avoid unintended consequences and ensure that any rules or  guidance are within the issuing agency’s mandate.  Moreover, to help avoid unintended  consequences, it is critical that the  banking agencies seek frequent public input from banks of all  sizes to ensure supervisory goals and expectations align with current capabilities, are properly  calibrated to the risks, and regulations, do not penalize bank customers or the communities banks  support  ***  We appreciate the FDIC’s use of principles, rather than reliance on more detailed or prescriptive  rules, and encourage the FDIC to continue to use this more flexible and iterative approach. This  will allow banks to adapt risk management to their most material issues and to adjust to the  rapidly evolving climate-risk policy and practice environment.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment of its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of Tioga State Bank  N.A., a $560 million community bank located in Spencer, NY. Our bank has been operating in Upstate  New York since 1864 as a commercial bank providing residential, small business and agricultural loans in  our market. I am very concerned that the proposed framework for managing climate-related financial  risk management for large banks will trickle down and negatively impact community banks throughout  the country.  Our bank has been managing climate risk since 1864. We have weathered numerous  blizzards, ice storms, floods, and droughts in our 150+ year history. We experienced two 100-year floods  over the past sixteen years, one in 2006 and another in 2011 that devastated many homes and  businesses in our community, however the bank came through both events with little to no losses. We  also assisted many of our customers and provided zero interest and low interest rate loans to many to  help them through the recovery process. Having been in business through various climate cycles over  150 years shows evidence that we know how to manage and mitigate that risk.  To my knowledge there  has not been a bank failure due to climate change or even climate transition. Our country has gone  through many different transitions over the last 150 years that banks have certainly been able to  manage. Our banking system is extremely resilient and showed that during the recent Covid pandemic.  I  understand the transition risks as we try to move our country away from fossil fuels. However, I don't  anticipate the transition risk to be a major impact in our market. It is interesting that there continues to  be differing opinions about the move away from fossil fuels to renewable sources. The book, Unsettled  by Steven E. Koonin and a recent opinion article in the Wall Street Journal, Fossil Fuels' Forthright  Defender both provide differing opinions on our ability to affect climate change and transition away  from fossil fuels. Additionally, community banks have proven time and time again that we are nimble  and work with our customers and course correct as needed when wide-sweeping changes do occur.  The  proposal would require large banks to perform scenario analysis via computer modeling to determine  the future impact on the bank due to changes in the economy, financial system and or physical hazards  due to climate-related events. Truthfully, I find this modeling to be senseless. Scientists have not been  able to use computer modeling to recreate past weather events much less predict the future. There are  just too many variables.  We all know that regulations, including climate change risk management, tend  to trickle down to smaller banks as best practices. I am very concerned about the additional costs to  bring in so-called ""climate experts"" to help us manage this ""new"" risk. There will be many new climate  expert consultants who will make some significant money when this is implemented.  Requiring  community banks to gather climate data from our customers will also be problematic. Most of our small  business customers would have no idea of how to determine this data, much less be willing to collect 
and disclose the data to their bank.  It is concerning that this framework could discourage banks from  doing business with legal but climate disfavored industries. In the Northeast, most homes in our area are  heated with fuel oil. There are many small businesses that are tied into this industry, from fuel oil  dealers to furnace install and repair shops. If these businesses are shunned from the banking system,  who will step in to fill this role? This could lead to another ""Operation Chokepoint"" to target businesses  that may be out of favor with the administration and therefore, have a severe negative affect on rural  America and the many small communities and small businesses  I appreciate that the FDIC is giving us  the opportunity to weigh in on this important subject and hope you consider this in the implementation  of the proposed framework. I appreciate that the framework is limited to banks over $100 billion in  assets and would encourage the FDIC to ensure the framework does not trickle down to community  banks as a best practice.    Sincerely,    Robert M. Fisher   President & CEO     1 N. Main Street  PO Box 386   Spencer, NY 14883-0386","Robert M. Fisher, President and CEO of Tioga State Bank, expresses concerns about the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework for large banks, fearing it may negatively impact community banks. He argues that community banks, like his, have successfully managed climate risks for over 150 years without significant losses, even during severe weather events. Fisher criticizes the requirement for scenario analysis via computer modeling, deeming it impractical due to the complexity of variables. He worries about the financial burden of hiring climate experts and the difficulty for small businesses to provide climate data. Fisher also fears the framework could discourage banks from working with industries linked to fossil fuels, potentially harming rural communities. He urges the FDIC to ensure the framework remains limited to large banks and does not trickle down to community banks."
75,kyl-uyug-yptr,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks.  If we fail to act on climate change threats, we will have no financial investments worth salvaging. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, as stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment addresses the issue of climate change and its impact on financial investments, urging Comptroller Hsu to take action.

CFA advocates for legislative and administrative  action to address the severe threats of climate change and the resulting serious economic,  environmental, and public health consequences. Climate change presents substantial risks to  financial institutions, our financial system, and our economy, and many financial institutions will  benefit from clear, holistic guidance on assessing those risks. We support this important step  toward addressing climate-related financial risks in the banking system and urge the FDIC to  meaningfully address all stakeholder concerns and questions, strengthen these draft principles,  and develop final principles that adequately address the existential and severe threat that climate  change poses to our financial system.     CFA is an association of non-profit consumer organizations that was established in 1968 to  advance the consumer interest through research, advocacy, and education. Over 250 of these  groups participate in the federation and govern it through their representatives on the  organization’s Board of Directors. Our comments are based on CFA’s many years of experience  advocating for consumer protections in the financial marketplace, protective financial and bank  regulation, and affordable and fair access to financial services.      
      2  1. Climate Change is an Existential Threat to Our Financial System That the FDIC  and Other Federal Regulators Must Address      The FDIC is an independent agency tasked by Congress to maintain stability and public  confidence of our nation’s financial system, by insuring, regulating, and supervising more than  5,000 banks and savings associations chartered by the states or by the Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency (OCC). The agency’s work is extremely vital to the nation’s financial system  and greater economy, and it works closely with a variety of regulatory agencies to fulfill its  mandate. The FDIC plays an important role in identifying and reducing financial risks. As the  Federal Reserve,1 the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC),2 and the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have indicated,3 climate change poses significant risks  and challenges to our economy, financial system, and financial stability. It is critically important  for the agency, and other federal financial regulators, to assume a leading role in mitigating the  risks posed by climate change.      Climate change is already affecting the United States with more extreme weather and natural  disasters,4 increasing surface temperature,5 and rising sea level,6 and these sweeping changes  show no sign of easing.7 For example, analysis of satellite images dating back to 1979 shows that  climate change is making hurricanes more intense and destructive. Now hurricanes are more  likely to develop into a Category 3 storm or higher, with winds of at least 110 miles per hour.8  Additionally, the U.S. Forest Service estimates that the fire season is two and a half months  longer than in the 1970s, and wildfires are burning more acres than ever before.9 In 2021, over  40% of Americans lived in counties affected by climate disasters, which included flooding,    1 “Climate Change Is a Source of Financial Risk.” By Glenn D.

      3  mudslides, power outages, wildfires, drought, and heat waves.10 These natural disasters cause not  only loss of life and property, but also significant economic costs – NOAA reports the U.S. has  witnessed 310 weather and climate disasters since 1980 with damage or costs of $1 billion or  more.11     Further, FSOC recently identified climate change as an emerging and increasing threat to  financial stability. The Council stated that by collecting and publicly disclosing data,  incorporating analysis of climate-related risks into supervisory and regulatory functions, and  promoting disclosures of climate-related risk, “financial regulators can both promote the  resilience of the financial system and help it support an orderly, economy-wide transition toward  the goal of net-zero emissions.”12     The risks to our financial system require further action beyond market forces and competition.  Strong regulations are needed to ensure that financial institutions adequately assess climate- related financial risks and are properly prepared for climate-related impacts, and that consumers  are sufficiently informed of how climate change will affect their financial well-being. Although  these principles are an important first step, they will only apply to a handful of regulated entities  as the majority of institutions regulated by the FDIC are community banks and savings  associations. These community banks and savings associations are critical to providing banking  access for low- and moderate-income consumers (LMI), who will be disproportionately affected  by climate change as discussed below. We implore the FDIC to encourage smaller financial  institutions to consider these risks and prepare for them, since these entities are more likely to  feel the brunt of climate change’s effects. Of course, principles for smaller institutions should be  tailored to their size and circumstances.    Further, the FDIC must also encourage the other financial regulators, including the National  Credit Union Association (NCUA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), to  address climate-related financial risks through their regulatory and supervisory actions as well.  Finally, the FDIC should coordinate its actions with the OCC, which recently issued its own  Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.13      10 “More than 40% of Americans Live in Countries Hit by Climate Disaster in 2021.” By Sarah Kaplan and Andrew Ba Tran.

      4  2. Climate Change Will Disproportionately Hurt Low- and Moderate-Income  Consumers and Communities of Color    Low- and moderate-income (LMI) consumers, communities of color, and other financially  vulnerable Americans are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change and climate- related financial risks.    These consumers already feel the brunt of predatory financial practices, discriminatory policies,  and systems that perpetuate existing disparities. In addition, these consumers have less access to  safe and affordable credit or traditional financial services and therefore, are more likely to be  unbanked and make use of nonbank financial services such as money orders, check-cashing  services, and payday loans.14     Among banked consumers, Black and Latino consumers are more likely than white consumers to  have incurred overdraft fees15 and are already harmed by lack of oversight and predatory  practices. Further, although 18% of consumers reported overdrafting an account in December  2021, these rates are higher for underbanked consumers and those experiencing income  volatility.16     High interest, short-term lenders specifically target and exploit Black communities– Black adults  are more likely than white adults to live near payday lenders and pawn shops.17 Although credit  cards can be a more affordable form of credit, Black consumers find it more difficult to obtain  them.18 Additionally, Black and Hispanic households find it more difficult to gain approval for  conventional mortgages, and when they are approved they tend to pay higher interest rates.19  This is partly due to the use of credit reports and scores, which both reflect and perpetuate large  racial disparities and have a very real impact on consumers’ abilities to pay their bills.20 Finally,  these systems and practices exacerbate the racial wealth gap–  in 2019, the typical white family    14 “How America Banks: Household Use of Banking and Financial Services.” Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

      5  had five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family and eight times the wealth of a typical  Black family.     These consumers are also particularly vulnerable to the greatest impacts of climate change and  will be the least able to prepare for and recover from the effects of climate change, including  health, labor, and financial costs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently reported  consumers of color and low-income consumers face disproportionate and unequal risks of the  impacts of climate change, including the impacts that air quality and extreme temperature will  have on health and labor hours, property damage and loss, and traffic delays due to island and  coastal flooding.21 Consumers of color are most likely to live in areas with the highest projected  impacts of climate changes.22 In addition, those consumers with low-income or no high school  degree are more likely to currently live in areas with the highest projected losses of labor hours.23  Therefore, consumers of color and low-income consumers are disproportionately at risk to the  highest health, labor, and property impacts of climate change.     Further, these consumers also bear the brunt of financial instability and crises. As we learned  from the 2008 financial crisis, the effects of financial crises are disproportionately felt by LMI24  consumers25 and communities of color.26 The result is a K-shaped recovery– following a  recession, different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes–  resulting in exacerbation of the existing wealth, homeownership, wage, and employment gaps.      Climate change and the associated financial risks will disproportionately harm consumers of  color and low-income consumers. Financial institutions cannot be idle spectators to the  anticipated effects climate change will have on our financial system and the consumers they  serve.      The FDIC must be aggressive and proactive to address the ways in which financial institution  activity might be fueling climate change and ensure that financial institutions are adequately  prepared for and addressing climate-related financial risks. Further, the FDIC should pay  particular attention to the ways in which vulnerable consumers will be disproportionately  affected by climate-related risks; and through supervision of regulated entities, monitor how  safety and soundness issues affect consumers of color, low-income consumers, and other    21 “Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States: A Focus on Six Impacts.” Environmental Protection Agency.

In addition, CFA welcomes the FDIC’s recent announcement to overhaul the Community  Reinvestment Act,27 and encourages the agency to strengthen and finalize its recent proposal to  address the impact of climate-related financial risks on LMI consumers and communities of  color.    3. CFA Recommends the Following:    In order for financial institutions to prepare for climate change and the associated risks, they  must adopt good governance strategies, apply transparency, accountability, responsibility, and  fairness in their business activities, and the FDIC must facilitate these changes through  mandatory requirements. Below are several recommendations that the FDIC and financial  institutions should take regarding climate-related financial risks.     The FDIC Should Enact Mandatory Requirements for Considering Climate-Related Financial  Risk     The FDIC’s principles for climate-related financial risk management provide an important  framework for reducing risks and preparing for worst-case scenarios. But the principles are  dependent upon the financial institutions recognizing their significance and fully embracing  them; if financial institutions are reluctant to implement the principles, they are of limited use.  The FDIC should therefore institute mandatory requirements to ensure large institutions are  adequately addressing climate-related financial risk and incorporating the costs of carbon  emissions into their financial strategies. For example, the FDIC should require greater capital  requirements to counter climate-related financial risk28 and in order to do that, climate change  needs to be included in economic and financial forecasts and assessments of systemic risk.29     The FDIC Should Extend Principles to Smaller Financial Institutions, For Which the Proposed  Principles Do Not Apply       27 FDIC, OCC, FRB, “Joint Proposal to Strengthen and Modernize Community Reinvestment Act Regulations,” (May 5, 2022)  https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22018.html.  28 “Addressing Climate-Related Financial Risk Through Bank Capital Requirements.” Center for American Progress.

      7  Further, as mentioned above, these principles will only apply to a small handful of regulated  entities as the majority of institutions regulated by the FDIC are community banks and savings  associations. Community banks and savings associations are critical to providing banking access  for LMI consumers, who will be disproportionately affected by climate change. The FDIC  should extend these principles to smaller banks and institutions, and these principles for smaller  institutions should be tailored to their size and circumstances.    The FDIC Should Work with Other Federal Agencies to Comprehensively Address Climate- Related Financial Risk    Interagency cooperation is essential to reducing climate-related financial risk and ensuring that  financial institutions are prepared for its adverse, multifaceted impacts. The FDIC should work  with the following organizations on various projects:     ● The FDIC should cooperate with the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to create a national  effort to develop and implement mitigation and resilience standards and strategies to  reduce exposure to climate change-driven risk.30 The effort should include how financial  institutions and insurance companies will contribute to such mitigation as part of their  overall work. FIO and the FDIC should also develop workstreams on insurance industry  underwriting practices with climate impacts, how available and affordable insurance is  and the likely impacts of climate change on that affordability and develop federal and  regional strategies to meet expanding capital needs for reinsuring major catastrophes and  natural disasters.   ● The FDIC should coordinate with other deposit institution regulators, the Federal  Reserve, the OCC, the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), and state banking  regulators, as well as the market regulators, Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA),  Office of Financial Research, and the CFPB, which has established a climate working  group.31 Together with these other regulators, the FDIC can require that all financial  institutions publicly disclose any assets that contribute to climate change, mitigate  climate risks to their portfolios, and provide credit, physical banking access, and  necessary financial services to communities facing the worst impacts of climate change.   ● The FDIC should further cooperate with other agencies, including but not limited to the  EPA, Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA), and CFPB to holistically  address the impact of climate change on consumer financial well-being and security. In  2021, the CFPB established a climate working group to better assess the impact of  climate change on consumer financial well-being and on the markets for consumer  financial products and services. The working group will also examine the adverse    30 “Re: FIO Insurance Sector and Climate-Related Financial Risks.” Consumer Federation of America. November 15, 2021.

      8  impacts of climate change of historically underserved and disadvantaged communities  and households–an obvious area of possible cooperation with the FDIC.32    Financial Institutions Should Take a Holistic View of Climate Risk and Stakeholder Exposure    In CFA’s aforementioned comments to the OCC, we discussed the importance of stakeholder  exposure to climate risk and regulator’s role in addressing it.33 These concepts may directly  apply to significantly fewer of the FDIC’s regulated entities, but they are still important  considerations, and the core concepts may still be relevant in the FDIC context as well.    The principles proposed by the FDIC advance critical considerations for regulated institutions.  As such, they should be adopted and built upon with a broader view of climate-related financial  risk management. Due to the size, organizational complexity, and economic footprint of our  banking system, financial institutions are unique among industry sectors in the context of climate  change. Financial institutions are exposed to the climate-related risks of their own financial  entanglements, and by extension their own stakeholders are exposed to the same. Because the  physical and socioeconomic footprint of financial institutions is so expansive,34 regulation of  them should be tailored to capture the unique risks that they present, and this reality should be  reflected in the FDIC’s principles for climate-related risk management and subsequent  regulations. On an institutional level, the complexities of financial institutions’ climate exposure  risk should also be reflected in risk management governance, policies and procedures, and public  disclosures.     As the FDIC develops principles and subsequent regulations for financial institutions, the view  must be that a financial institution’s stakeholders include more than just physical assets, balance  sheets, and shareholders. For these financial institutions, and as discussed throughout this  comment letter, the impacts of both good climate risk management and less-than-good climate  risk management will have significant downstream impacts, and this will be especially true for  those communities that are already the most vulnerable, both to the physical impacts of climate  change and the financial impacts of instability in the financial system. As the FDIC’s proposed  principles state, “The board and management should also consider climate-related financial risk  impacts on stakeholders’ expectations, the institution’s reputation, and LMI and other  disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products  and services.” This statement should be a forethought for oversight, rather than an afterthought.       32 Id.   33 CFA Comments to OCC re Climate-Related Financial Risk, (Feb. 2022).  34 “Are Banks Prepared for Climate Change?” Boston Common Asset Management., (2015). Available at  https://bostoncommonasset.com/Membership/Apps/ICCMSViewReport_Input_App.ashx?IX_OB=None&IX_mId=18&IX_RD= Y&ObjectId=731308, (“Banks are tied to every market sector through their lending practices, making them uniquely vulnerable  to climate-related risk.”). 
      9  The FDIC’s RFI asks, “How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial  risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?” This  question may or may not seek to impart the same meaning of the word “material” as does the  anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws,35 but hopefully not. To do so would unfortunately  lead to a view that may dangerously narrow the climate-related considerations of banks’ risk  management strategies and those which the FDIC should incorporate into its oversight.  Importantly, it is difficult to identify an industry sector that has more vulnerabilities or touch  points to climate change as do financial institutions,36 and to limit consideration and/or  management of these unique vulnerabilities by way of a narrowed materiality analysis would be  dangerous for financial institutions, their stakeholders, and the financial system writ large. The  climate risks of one institution are likely to seed climate risks for many others as well, and a  narrowed view of material climate risks may therefore undermine the systemic view required of  the FDIC.37      Appropriately, the RFI asks, “How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be  augmented to better capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?”  Here again, the RFI seems to appreciate the complex, multifaceted impacts that climate change  poses for financial institutions. As such, the FDIC should certainly consider information that is  financially material to regulated entities’ direct stakeholders, but only as one piece of the larger  constellation of climate change risks that should be actively managed by financial institutions,  and should be incorporated into their risk governance and strategic planning, and also codified in  the FDIC’s safety and soundness oversight and regulation.    Financial Institutions Should Gather Expertise and Authority for Climate Scientists    Financial institutions should possess substantial expertise on climate change and its impacts,  both physical and financial. Knowledge about climate change is essential for making informed  decisions and yet, too many financial institutions are ignorant of this subject. Financial  institutions should be required to have climate scientists as members of their corporations and for  these scientists to be given resources and authority so they can evaluate the impacts of rising sea  levels, more frequent extreme weather disasters, and other consequences of a warming plant.  These positions should be substantive and possess the power to make real reforms, as opposed to  surface level “greenwashing”— conveying a false impression or providing misleading    35 “Comment Letter Re: Public Input on Climate Change Disclosures.” Consumer Federation of America.

Bank boards and  management must also understand climate-related financial exposures and the vulnerability of  their institutions.     A few banks, including the European Central Bank and Lombard Odier, are competing to hire  experts in order to gain knowledge and decarbonize their portfolios and loan books.38 Mounting  evidence shows that climate change poses a serious threat to price stability and financial systems,  and some institutions feel they require greater expertise.     Although CFA appreciates Acting Comptroller Hsu’s identification of the following questions  that bank boards should be able to adequately address, all financial institutions, including those  regulated by the FDIC, should impart their answers and work plans to address these concerns  with their regulators:     ● What is our long-term exposure to climate change, and how manageable is this exposure?   ● Which counterparties, sectors, or locales need our heightened attention and focus?   ● How vulnerable are our data centers and other critical services to extreme weather?   ● What can we do to position ourselves to seize opportunities from climate change?39       Financial Institutions Should Divest from Climate Change Exacerbating Projects    The FDIC must ensure that public facing promises made by financial institutions to divest from  climate change exacerbating projects are met, and that through investment, financial institutions  are not further contributing to many of the industries that worsen climate change. For example,  many banks finance activities that further fuel climate change and are more likely to harm  vulnerable consumers such as natural gas extraction, coal mines, and coal-fired power plants, and  oil extraction and pipelines. From 2016 to 2020 the world’s 60 largest commercial and  investment banks invested $3.8 trillion into fossil fuels.40      Financial institutions must stop funding fossil fuel projects such as oil pipelines, natural gas-fired  power plants, and coal-fired power plants, which emit greenhouse gas emissions and increase  climate change. These projects lead to stronger hurricanes and wildfires, drought and heat waves,  more frequent and extensive flooding, unusually hot or cold weather patterns, and rising sea  levels, which lead to massive financial and human costs, as well as destruction of both personal    38 “Climate Scientists Swap Fieldwork for Finance.” By Simon Jessop, Carolyn Cohn, and Iain Withers.

Therefore, the result is a self-fulfilling cycle of banks  financing climate change, which contributes to financial instability while raising costs and  creating greater exposure for the most vulnerable consumers.     Despite making public facing promises to invest in clean, sustainable financing, many banks  have been resistant to divest from fossil fuels.41 These actions are necessary in order to reduce  climate change and transition to a lower-carbon economy. Financial institutions must stop  financing new fossil fuel projects and expanding existing projects. Further, they should start  phasing out existing insurance and funding for them unless there are exceptional circumstances.     Financial Institutions Should Prioritize Long-Term Thinking and Analysis    Traditionally banks and other financial institutions have prioritized shorter time horizons, profits,  and immediate risks. While they examine past records and behavior, they make decisions based  on immediate and near-future consequences. But investors, market participants, financial  institutions, and regulators all must consider the effects of climate change and its impact on risks  over the long term.     In comparison, insurance companies aim to distribute risk so that individuals and individual  companies do not have to bear the full brunt of losses, by selling a diverse set of policies across a  variety of markets. However, large natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires can destroy  or impact large areas and overwhelm insurers, possibly creating compounding losses. Climate  change is making these cases more frequent, yet many insurers are underestimating the risks  involved.42 Banks and other financial institutions must prioritize long term planning and legacies  over short term profits. They should consider circumstances and climate over the next twenty,  thirty, or even fifty years, and make the necessary preparations.     4. Conclusion     The FDIC’s draft principles are an excellent beginning to addressing climate related financial  risk. CFA urges that they be strengthened and adopted as quickly as possible. The banking  industry, its regulators, and all consumers have a lot at stake, yet the burden of climate change  and the financial risks will be disproportionately carried by consumers of color, LMI, and other  vulnerable consumers. Climate change will impact every area of the financial sector and create  dramatic risks, raising costs for everyone unless sweeping measures are adopted.        41 Id.  42 “The $5 Trillion Insurance Industry Faces a Reckoning.

They urge the FDIC to address stakeholder concerns, strengthen the draft principles, and extend them to smaller institutions. CFA highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on low- and moderate-income consumers and communities of color, advocating for mandatory requirements for financial institutions to assess and manage climate risks. They recommend interagency cooperation, divestment from fossil fuels, and long-term planning to mitigate climate risks. CFA also stresses the importance of transparency, accountability, and the inclusion of climate scientists in financial institutions. They conclude by urging the FDIC to adopt and strengthen the draft principles swiftly to protect vulnerable consumers and ensure financial stability."

However, a non-binding guidance that merely provides guiding principles for banks with assets of $100 Billion or more is not enough.

The latter is starkly absent from OCC’s proposed guidance; for the reasons discussion herein, this lack of coverage causes Friends of the Earth significant concern. In January 2021, U.S President Joe Biden took an initial step toward rejoining the global accord, Paris climate change agreement, which was a landmark achievement of former President Barack Obama and from which former President Donald Trump later withdrew.4 Each country established its own pledge to combat climate change under the Paris Agreement, which was negotiated in 2015 and signed in 2016.5 President Biden signed an Executive Order on Climate- Related Financial Risks in May 2021, instructing the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to assess and report on specific climate risks.6 Section 3 of the Order titled “Assessment of Climate-Related Financial Risk by Financial Regulators” requires the Secretary of the Treasury, as Chair of the FSOC, to “engage with FSOC members to consider the necessity of any actions to enhance climate-related disclosures by regulated entities to mitigate climate-related financial risk to the financial system or assets and a recommended implementation plan for taking those actions,” and to issue a report to the President within 180 days of the date of the order on any efforts by FSOC member agencies to integrate consideration of climate-related financial risk in their policies and programs, including “any current approaches to incorporating the consideration of climate-related financial risk into their respective regulatory and supervisory activities and any impediments they faced in adopting those approaches.”7 4 Russell Gold et al., President Biden Quickly Rejoined Paris Climate Accord.

Federal officials, non-governmental entities, and the general public have advocated for a larger effort to combat climate change via executive branch agencies or independent regulators. They want the Federal Reserve to have a stronger hand in influencing finance in the fossil-fuel business.8 A Supervision Climate Committee (SCC) was recently established by the Federal Reserve to analyze and mitigate climate-related risks to supervised firms,9 and OCC has issued the proposed guidance at issue here. But this is not enough. It is crucial for the SCC to collaborate with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and OCC to develop and disseminate mandatory, binding regulations, instead of supervisory guidelines, on climate-related risks as fast as possible.10 Bank regulators in the United States should also look to international peers that are steps ahead with implementing climate-related regulations.11 Banking regulators must invest in internal climate capacity and ensure that examiners are adequately trained to ensure that these institutions are functioning in a safe and sound manner with respect to these risks as part of this effort.12 Integrating climate risk into continuing supervision would support the development of new climate-related legislation and guarantee that climate issues are correctly centered in core decision- making functions at banks.13 Issuing guidance will not accomplish as much as enforceable regulations that oblige banks to incorporate both climate and financial sector risks into their risk management frameworks since 8 Pete Schroeder, Wall Street sees first Fed climate change review in 2023, REUTERS (Nov. 17, 2021, 8:39 PM) https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/wall-street-sees-first-fed-climate-change-review-2023-2021-11-17/; “Moreover, Congress could go even further than financial regulators’ significant, but constrained, authority and more directly phase out fossil fuel financing in an orderly fashion to mitigate these risks.” Gregg Gelzinis, Addressing Climate-Related Financial Risk Through Bank Capital Requirements, CTR.

banks have already objected to the development of climate-related stress tests.14 They claim that climate-related shocks and their impacts are highly unpredictable, and that modeling them would be difficult.15 It is important to clarify that stress tests are not intended to forecast the future.16 Rather, they are used to “test bank balance sheets against extreme, but plausible, scenarios.” 17 Given the aim and significance of stress testing, these issues are far from insurmountable. Furthermore, banks have complained about the scenarios’ extended time horizons when it comes to assumptions about bank balance sheets.18 As a matter of fact, banks’ arguments against climate-related stress tests are similar to their arguments against the initial stress tests, the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, and the annual macroeconomic tests devised in the aftermath of 2007-2009 financial crisis, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.19 Banks have been at odds with the Federal Reserve for the past 12 years on what constitutes appropriate or realistic scenarios, models, and assumptions.20 Mr. Hsu has urged the financial services industry to take climate change risk more seriously.21 The proposed guidance demonstrates the regulator's desire to encourage banks to 14 Francisco Covas, Challenges in Stress Testing and Climate Change, BANK POL'Y INST.

consider their climate risk, and in fact the largest US Banks have begun to devote resources, albeit insufficiently, to this area.22 Mr. Hsu detailed efforts by OCC to push banks to get a better handle on the risks posed to their balance sheets by climate change and extreme weather events at the WSJ Pro’s Sustainable Business Forum in December. Nevertheless, banks will keep resisting and argue that the cost outweighs the risk. Under the proposed guidance, such resistance will be an effective strategy for banks to avoid adopting robust, predictive risk-management tools. It is finally time for OCC to issue regulations mandating banks to, in fact, fully assess climate- and finance-related risks and adjust their balance sheets over time to avoid these long- term risks. OCC is empowered to take several types of official enforcement actions against financial institutions and parties linked with them.23 I. OCC’s Authority over Banks General Regulatory Power of OCC It is within the scope of OCC’s powers to issue regulations targeting national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies of foreign banking organizations.24 The main duties of OCC consist of chartering, regulating, and supervising all national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.25 OCC makes certain that the banks it oversees are safe and sound, that they provide fair access to financial services, that they treat clients fairly, and that they follow all applicable laws and regulations.26 22 Id. 23Enforcement Action Types, OCC, https://www.occ.gov/topics/laws-and-regulations/enforcement- actions/enforcement-action-types/index-enforcement-action-types.html (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 24 Id. 25Who We Are, OCC, https://www.occ.treas.gov/about/who-we-are/index-who-we-are.html (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 26 Id. 6
One of the core mission functions of the agency is to supervise banks and establish appropriate policies.27 OCC enjoys broad regulatory powers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). SOX Section 11.1 provides that “[t]he Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is vested with the powers, functions, and duties otherwise vested in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to administer and enforce the provisions of sections . . . of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . . . for national banks and Federal savings associations with one or more classes of securities subject to the registration provisions of sections 12(b) and (g) of the Exchange Act . . . [f]urther, OCC has general rulemaking authority under 12 U.S.C. §§ 93(a), 1462(a), 1463, and 1464, to promulgate rules and regulations concerning the activities of national banks and Federal savings associations.”28 The U.S. Code mirrors the SOX provision as it gives OCC the authority to issue rules and regulations to carry out the office’s functions.29 Section 1463 notes that OCC’s regulations targeting savings associations must be as stringent as those established for national banks.30 Other functions of OCC consist of assessing and reviewing banks’ compliance with SOX standards.31 More specifically, banks that have a class of securities registered with OCC under 12 C.F.R. § 11 or 12 C.F.R. § 16 are subject to this type of supervision.32 OCC could cite a violation of law on the specific section of SOX at the bank level if the overall compliance program, including §404 supporting documentation, reveals any significant weaknesses.33 27Supervision Risk and Analysis, OCC, https://www.occ.treas.gov/about/who-we-are/organizations/supervision-risk- and-analysis/index-supervision-risk-and-analysis.html (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 28 Section 11.1, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002. 29 12 U.S. Code § 93(a). 30 12 U.S. Code § 1463. 31 Internal and External Audits, OCC, Version 1.1, 63 (July 2019), https://www.occ.gov/publications-and- resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/internal-external-audits/pub-ch-audits.pdf. 32 Id. 33 Id. 7
Pertinent OCC Enforcement Actions OCC is not limited to issuing mere guidance focused only on climate-related financial risks. Rather, OCC should take a more effective and authoritative route and issue comprehensive climate- and financial-risk regulations that banks and other financial institutions have to comply with. The agency possesses various “Enforcement Action Types” that would further its goals and policies by deterring those institutions from violating the regulations.34 For instance, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(b) allows OCC to issue Cease & Desist Orders or Personal Cease-and-Desist Orders to require banks or institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from an unsafe or unsound practice or violation and to take affirmative action to correct or remedy any conditions resulting from any violation or practice.35 OCC could push the banks to take affirmative action to correct or remedy any conditions resulting from any violation or unsafe or unsound practice through the issuance of restitution orders that could require banks to make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss.36 Banks could be subject to Civil Money Penalty Orders, which consist of orders issued under 12 U.S.C. §1818(i), that require them to pay a monetary penalty.37 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured banks are subject to mandatory and discretionary restrictions and actions depending upon the bank’s Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) capital category.38 Technically, by issuing a PCA directive, OCC imposes discretionary restrictions and actions on the bank.39 Finally, OCC can serve banks a “Notice of Charges” (also referred to as “Notice of Assessment of Civil Money Penalty”) commencing litigation against the respondent banks when necessary.40 34 OCC, supra note 23. 35 Id. 36 Id. 37 Id. 38 Id. 39 Id. 40 Id. 8
II. OCC Must Enact Binding Regulations The proposed guidance acknowledges both the physical and transitional risks associated with climate change but fails to require banks to do anything to counteract these significant risks. The current proposal is only guidance – stating what banks should do – instead of a series of regulations that would ensure that banks monitor the environmental- and financial-related risks of their funding decisions. While this proposal is a step in the right direction, a mandatory binding rulemaking that forces banks to comply would better serve OCC’s goal of lowering a bank’s exposure to both physical and transitional risks. OCC has previously acknowledged that they have the authority to mandate banks’ compliance.41 OCC could utilize deterrents such as fines, civil penalties, or civil liability to enforce compliance. We ask OCC to deploy its full power to provide teeth to this set of principles by issuing binding regulations. Bank Resistance Although there are compliance costs associated with binding regulation, the benefits of reducing exposure to climate-related financial risks would far outweigh the cost.42 The proposed guidance suggests banks should take extra steps to monitor risks posed by climate change; however, the increased cost associated with the increased scrutiny may leave banks hesitant to comply. Similar to the implementation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, a bank’s internal costs could increase as a direct result of compliance. Banks would likely be averse to reducing their carbon footprint if there is no immediately evident benefit for them, especially if there is an up- front cost involved. The idea of managing risk is not a novel concept. Major banks already contain 41 Yevgeny Shrago, Fact Sheet: OCC Climate Guidance for Banks, PUB. CITIZEN https://www.citizen.org/article/fact-sheet-occ-climate-guidance-for-banks/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 42 Joseba Eceiza et al., Banking Imperatives for Managing Climate Risk, MCKINSEY (June 1, 2020), https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/banking-imperatives-for-managing- climate-risk. 9
robust risk management departments to monitor risks and hedge against uncertainty. Each bank has varying exposure to risks resulting from climate change and differing tolerances to risk, but it is undoubtedly in a bank’s best interest to analyze their profile.43 Regardless of their risk tolerances, a bank must understand their exposure to adequately manage their potential risk. Moreover, given the current “code red” moment for humanity and our warming planet, it behooves all federal agencies to vigorously regulate climate risks within their purview, and not avoid necessary regulation due to push-back by banks that are solely concerned about their short-term profits. Banks Should Manage Risks Related to Climate Change The main function of risk management is to protect a bank’s balance sheet from uncertainty.44 Banks have major exposure in industries with high transition risks, including energy, mining, water, transportation, and construction.45 A study conducted by consulting firm McKinsey and Company found that risks resulting from a changing climate could have “direct and indirect negative impact on banks, including an increase in stranded assets, uncertain residual values, and the potential loss of reputation.”46 Furthermore, these risks could potentially cause major losses. The McKinsey study presented an example of these risks by calculating the potential loss rate Miami-Dade County could experience as a direct result of rising sea levels. They concluded that severe flooding could lead to a loss rate of 2.53 percent, just lower than the 2.95 loss rate Miami experienced during the peak of 2008’s financial crisis.47 Additionally, if there is any external pressure from an economic slowdown, the rate could increase to as much as 7.25 percent loss.48 43 Michael S. Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask (Nov. 8, 2021), https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2021/pub-speech-2021-116.pdf. 44Eceiza, supra note 42. 45 Id. 46 Id. 47 Id. 48 Id. 10
Banks have substantial exposure to climate-related financial-risks that must be assessed and mitigated; further, if financial-related climate risks are left unmonitored it could open these institutions up to significant long-term losses.49 Mandatory regulations would ensure that banks consider these potential risks in their lending practices.50 Some of the largest banks have claimed to acknowledge these risks for years.51 Influential banks have claimed commitments to more sustainable banking including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Barclays. Barclays in particular claimed it is committed to managing both direct and indirect risks associated with climate change.52 Its central risk management department now includes a team solely dedicated to evaluating environmental risk.53 Further, the bank says it has taken steps to educate and train business and credit risk teams on the dangers of environmental risks.54 Barclays identified over 50 environmentally sensitive industries and created guidance documents to brief lending teams on the environmental risks these sectors pose, even requiring more stringent due diligence when evaluating the investment.55 Nevertheless, it is important to point out that while these banks claim they are moving in this direction, most have yet to take meaningful action. 49 Id. 50 Rainforest Action Network’s annual Banking on Climate Chaos report documents state that since the Paris Agreement and all these new bank promises, total fossil fuel financing has increased. 51 A growing number of banks have committed to be “net zero by 2050,” meaning that the net sum of their financed greenhouse gas emissions would be zero by 2050. Friends of the Earth International believes that “net zero by 2050” is a faulty approach due to methodological flaws, the exclusion of the full scope of emissions, reliance on unproven technologies and non-viable offsets, and postponement of action needed today, among other concerns. Friends of the Earth US believes a more viable approach is to curb bank financing of the most harmful projects immediately. For example, in the fossil fuel sector, Friends of the Earth US proposes the curbing of fossil fuel expansion projects immediately and phase out funding for other fossil fuels in line with the internationally accepted 1.5 °C warming target. 52 Environmental Risks in Lending, BARCLAYS, https://home.barclays/citizenship/the-way-we-do- business/environmental-risks-in-lending/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 53 Id. 54 Id. 55 Id. 11
Despite large banks stated commitments to reduce their climate impacts, a study conducted by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) found that, “… 2020 [financing] levels remained higher than in 2016, the year immediately following the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The overall fossil fuel financing trend of the last five years is still heading definitively in the wrong direction, reinforcing the need for banks to establish policies that lock in the fossil fuel financing declines….”56 While banks claim to make commitments to reduce their climate impacts, there has yet to be a discernable movement in that direction. A binding regulation from OCC will ensure all banks take effective measures toward assessing and minimizing both financial and climate risks. Although a few of the largest banks by asset size claim to have begun to move towards more sustainable practices, commercial market pressure is likely not enough to ensure they and other banks will fully acknowledge or mitigate environmental risks. Mandatory binding regulations are needed to compel all banks to act, and to ensure that the practices adopted by banks will be the most effective. McKinsey notes that “There are material risks on a ten-year horizon (not far beyond the average maturity of loan books), and transition risks are already becoming real, forcing banks, for example, to write off stranded assets.57 In addition to financial risks, environmental risks could lead to severe losses in the near future, making it banks’ best interest to also monitor these potential risks. III. Demands OCC should embrace the global wave and follow best International Models Mr. Hsu said in November that OCC’s guidance would be consistent with the principles discussed in international forums such as the Network for Greening the Financial System, a 56 RAINFOREST ACTION NETWORK, BANKING ON CLIMATE CHAOS: FOSSIL FUEL FINANCE REPORT (2021), https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Banking-on-Climate-Chaos-2021.pdf. 57 Eceiza, supra note 42. 12
network of central banks and financial supervisors.58 Mr. Hsu added that the guidelines would not be the agency’s final word on climate risk, and that the agency will continue to investigate various aspects of climate risk.59 As climate change is rapidly worsening, countries across the world have been working alongside to remedy the situation. An increasing number of central banks, the world’s most powerful financial institutions, say they want to be environmental stewards as well.60 Climate change, according to central banks, is both a financial and economic danger. Rising sea levels, increasing numbers of wildfires, and more powerful storms will result in shortages, which will lead to inflation, the regulators' traditional foe.61 Globally, the most committed banks are attempting to mitigate climate change by diverting their financial systems away from fossil fuels.62 Their restrictions may have an impact on American corporations doing business abroad. A long- term trend has developed with the frequency and costs of severe weather-related disasters increasing over the last two decades.63 Climate change, as well as other reasons such as greater economic development in high-risk locations, have contributed to this tendency.64 Event counts and total cost estimates reflect weather and climate disaster events with costs exceeding one billion in CPI-adjusted 2020 dollars.65 58 Dylan Tokar, U.S. Climate Risk Guidance Will Be in Line With Global Principles, Bank Regulator Says, WALL STREET J.

members, including central banks and regulators from key European countries, as well as China, Russia, and Japan.68 Some members are making policy changes in response to climate concerns, including as greater capital charges for lending to fossil-fuel businesses and bank stress tests that focus on the risk of rising temperatures to loan portfolios.69 Although the Bank of England’s own carbon footprint is infinitesimal compared to that of the banks OCC should be regulating, this bank began disclosing emissions from its physical activities in 2020, such as producing bank notes, the carbon footprint of its buildings and business travel.70 The Bank of England’s mandate has been expanded to encompass environmental sustainability in addition to price stability.71 The Bank of France has begun to calculate the costs of climate change. Because of the increased risk of droughts and flooding, a pilot climate stress test of banks and insurers indicated that the cost of insurance claims in parts of France could jump by as much as six times by 2050.72 Climate change has been already addressed by the European Central Bank's mandate, which controls monetary policy and bank regulation in the eurozone.73 The Bank for International Settlements, also known as the central bank for central banks, has a renewable energy financing program.74 The European Central Bank is assisting in the funding of this program.75 It is clear that the United States is lagging behind. 68 Michael S.

According to the central bank organization, regulators who ignore climate threats are failing in their duties.76 “If you have a financial stability mandate and you are not looking at climate then you are not fulfilling your mandate properly,” said Morgan Després, head of the secretariat of the Network for Greening the Financial System at the Bank of France in Paris.77 It is important to recognize the Federal Government’s desire to improve corporate disclosure of carbon emissions and climate risks. 78 But it is crucial to mention that it is past time to impose regulations on banks that will compel them to look beyond the models they have used to regulate financing and markets in the past.79 Without strong climate-related regulations, banks will simply maintain their current positions and defend fossil fuel investments. Climate change regulation is a global move that the U.S. must swiftly follow. From a financial perspective, climate change is already affecting the bottom lines for U.S. companies abroad; but from a scientific perspective, it is causing widespread, rapid, and intensifying global harm, some of which is now irreversible.80 This is an eye-opening moment for OCC to go beyond issuing mere guidance. Sarbanes Oxley Provides a Regulatory Model An alternative to OCC’s proposed guidance would be to model regulations after The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Even though the Sarbanes Oxley Act is an act of Congress, its framework could be adopted by OCC while issuing a binding regulation that forces banks to address both climate-related financial risks as well as financial-related climate risks. SOX mandates controls and practices to ensure the reliability of financial reports of public companies 76 Clark, supra note 11. 77 Nick J. Adam, Central Banks Jump Into Climate-Change Policy Fray, TECHILIVE, (May 17, 2021), https://techilive.in/central-banks-jump-into-climate-change-policy-fray/. 78 Clark, supra note 11. 79 Id. 80IPCC Report:‘Code Red’ for Human Driven Global Heating, Warns UN Chief, UN (Aug. 9, 2021), https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362.

that could impact investing practices. The process controls and public reporting requirements sanctioned by the act could be mirrored in OCC’s effort to require banks to acknowledge environmental risks associated with their financing. Moreover, SOX provides guidelines for compliance of corporate directors and officers, including civil liability and criminal penalties. These guidelines could readily be transitioned into the context of environmental risk management. A reasonable suggestion would be to mirror the internal controls required by §404 of The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.81 Sarbanes Oxley §404 mandates publicly traded companies to file an annual report with the Securities Exchange Commission; the report must be certified by the company’s officers and attested to by external auditors. The act requires management to “establish and maintain an adequate internal control structures” and to assess the effectiveness of those controls. Although the controls mandated by Sarbanes Oxley revolve around financial reporting, OCC could introduce a similar control system to require banks to acknowledge environmental risks associated with their financing practices. Banks Must Submit Environmental Risk Assessments to OCC A major requirement of Sarbanes Oxley is the submission of an annual report with the SEC. Prior to the enaction of SOX, the trustworthiness of financial reports had deteriorated – specifically in wake of the Enron Scandal – and there was significant evidence that companies were manipulating earnings.82 Former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt highlighted the problem stating “we are witnessing an erosion in the quality of earnings, and therefore, the quality of financial reporting. Managing may be giving way to manipulation; integrity may be losing out to illusion.”83 81 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (116 Stat. 745). 82 Murdock, Sarbanes Oxley Five Years Later: Hero or Villain, 39 LYUCHILJ 525, 558 (2008). 83 Id. (quoting Arthur Levitt, Chairman, SEC, The “Numbers Game,” Remarks at the N.Y.U. Center for Law and Business (Sept. 28, 1998)). 17
This problem has become less rampant following the implementation of SEC reporting, mainly due to the officer’s attestation as officers could be subject to fines or imprisonment. A similar approach could be imposed on banks to mandate their compliance in the management of risks resulting from and contributing to climate change. This area is currently unregulated, and banks have free reign to make investments without regard to the financial or environmental risks associated with their decisions. This is analogous to financial reporting prior to Sarbanes Oxley, as corporate directors and officers can make decisions without accountability. The implementation of a similar reporting system to Sarbanes Oxley would provide more accountability, as OCC could require banks to acknowledge the role that climate change plays for both financial and environmental risks associated with their practices. If OCC notices that a bank has failed to comply, they would be able to utilize their broad powers to impose fines or otherwise deter these practices. These deterrents could include but are not limited to civil liability and criminal penalties for management who signs off on a fraudulent report. IV. Banks must specifically analyze and disclose their contribution to deforestation as an environmental risk Deforestation is a significant contributor to climate change globally, and as part of the climate-related risk governance framework, banks must recognize and incorporate the significant risks associated with financing companies connected to deforestation.84 U.S. banks and financial institutions actively fund companies involved in deforestation and land degradation through debt 84 Deforestation is not the only activity in which banks participate that has impacts on the climate. Large banks also directly finance fossil fuel production such as coal, oil, and gas. See David Tong, Unused Tools: How Central Banks Are Fueling the Climate Crisis, OIL CHANGE INTL. (2021), http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2021/08/central_bank_report_A4_v08.pdf; RAINFOREST ACTION NETWORK, BANKING ON CLIMATE CHAOS: FOSSIL FUEL FINANCE REPORT (2021), https://www.ran.org/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/Banking-on-Climate-Chaos-2021.pdf. 18
and equity financing and make billions in interest, dividends, and fees in the process.85 These companies produce, trade, or use soft commodities like soy, beef, and palm oil which are mass produced using destructive methods. The production of agricultural commodities in the developing world — including soy, palm, timber, cocoa, pulp & paper and cattle — contribute to deforestation and climate change in multiple ways. First, tropical agriculture is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions.86.If tropical deforestation were a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world.87 Forests hold more carbon than humans have emitted for the past 30 years through fossil fuel use. However, deforestation now accounts for roughly 8% of global emissions,88 and converting forests into farmland is the number one cause.89 Second, farming activities (including plowing and irrigation) and inputs (such as fertilizer and fuel) also produce emissions. This accounts for another 11% of global emissions. Finally, forests act as a carbon sink and help mitigate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Deforestation reduces the amount of carbon that the world’s forests can remove from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. In the 1990s, intact tropical forests removed around 46 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere, a total of 17% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the decade. This figure decreased to 6% of emissions during the subsequent decade in part because tropical forests are shrinking. One recent study from 2017 estimated that forests could mitigate over a third of the total carbon needed to limit global temperature rise to only 2° Celsius by 2030.90 85 Deforestation Dividends: How global banks profit from rainforest destruction and human rights abuses, GLOB.

If historical trends continue, we stand to lose another 131.21 million hectares of standing forest cover over the next 30 years, an area approximately the size of Peru. Virtually all the scientific models for meeting the Paris goals require achieving zero net deforestation by 2030. Furthermore, most deforestation in the developing world linked to internationally traded commodities is illegal (violates local law) and connected to organized crime.91 Companies that contribute to deforestation span across all stages of the supply chain, “from those managing plantations, to commodity traders, processors and manufacturers, and retailers across a wide sector of industries from food to cosmetics.”92 Banks and financial institutions expose themselves to deforestation risks through financing these companies.93 Complex supply chains and commodity aggregation impose traceability challenges, which make it difficult to parse out the companies involved in deforestation. However, initiatives to improve monitoring and traceability have developed technology to link companies and banking institutions to deforestation risks. For example, Trase Finance is a “data-driven transparency initiative” that maps supply chains and financing of tropical commodities like beef, soy, and palm oil.94 It provides accessible online tools to the public to reveal how commodity exports, companies, and financial institutions are linked to deforestation. Trase Finance reveals that asset managers like Vanguard Group hold shares in commodity traders of soy and palm oil exposed to significant deforestation risks.95 In fact, Trase Finance shows that Vanguard had the highest exposure to 91 Illegal Agriculture Is the Main Reason We’re Still Losing Forests.

Brazilian Soy deforestation risk of all US financial institutions in 2018 through equity holdings.96 Forests & Finance is another initiative that allows the public to search for the top investors and creditors financing tropical commodity production linked to deforestation by region.97 A deep dive into Forests & Finance reveals that JP Morgan Chase bank was the top American creditor funding the production of risky tropical commodities in 2021.98 These initiatives show that there is a growing public pressure and demand for transparency and accountability from companies and financial institutions with regard to their connection to deforestation. The risks from deforestation threaten our global financial system The physical risks associated with deforestation present a direct danger to the global financial system. Biodiversity loss and climate change present major sustainability challenges for investors, and deforestation is directly linked to both.99 The US economy relies heavily on tropical commodities, and rainfall in crucial agricultural regions of Texas and Mexico is affected by the Amazon rainforest.100 In fact, fifty percent of the world’s GDP relies on nature and ecosystem services affected by deforestation, and a loss in services like pollination and wild fisheries could lead to a $2.7 trillion decline in global GDP by 2030. 101 The increasing government, shareholder, and public understanding of the US banking system’s role in deforestation and climate change presents legal and reputational risks for banks. Changing consumer sentiment and public pressure by environmental organizations on banks to discontinue funding deforestation will impose reputational risks, and there have already been 96 The Vanguard Group, Inc., TRASE, https://trase.finance/financiers/4903b402-a3e4-3beb-a0b6-deab6df9b5bc (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 97 Finance’s Role in Deforestation, FORESTS & FIN., https://forestsandfinance.org/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 98 Data Deep Dive, FORESTS & FIN., https://forestsandfinance.org/data/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 99Sustainable Land Use, PRINCIPLES FOR RESP.

public initiatives to make this funding more transparent. Legal risks may also arise as new legislation requiring climate-related financial disclosures link companies to their impacts on deforestation, climate change, and the financial institutions that fund them. Especially as the environmental and human rights abuses associated with deforestation and the enormous profits banks have made through funding these operations come to light. This is so because the increased scrutiny of environmental and human rights abuses draws more public attention to the need to reform the sector generally. In fact, congress has already started taking action. In October of 2021, three members of Congress introduced the federal FOREST Act – a bipartisan bill that provides the Federal government with tools to deter commodity-driven illegal deforestation and directly addresses the impact of the U.S. market on global deforestation.102 This demonstrates that there is increasing concern taken on by members of congress to address deforestation, and highlights the growing risk associated with investments linked to deforestation. The first known case of a bank being held accountable for its damaging lending practices arose in 2020.103 The Australian bank ANZ agreed to compensate land-grabbing victims with the profits made from a $40 million loan it granted to a sugar company after it forcibly removed them from their land in Cambodia to build a sugar plantation. Although ANZ acknowledged its inadequate due diligence before funding the project, it maintained that it was not legally liable for the damages arising out of the project.104 Test cases for financial sector accountability have started to appear across the world with the filing of claims against banks for the environmental and human rights abuses that result from 102 FOREST Act Bill, https://www.schatz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/forest_act.pdf; Brian Schatz U.S. Senator for Hawai’i press release on the FOREST Act, https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-blumenauer- unveil-new-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-stop-illegal-deforestation-around-the-world-fight-climate-change. 103 GLOB.

the projects they finance. One case was filed against the Dutch Bank ING in 2019 by campaign groups through an OECD complaint mechanism.105 Another complaint was brought jointly by Friends of the Earth Australia and Australian bush-fire victims against ANZ bank under OECD guidelines.106 The complaint targets ANZ’s failure to adhere to Paris Agreement reduction targets through its lending practices and for violating the Paris Agreement guidelines by not disclosing “the full extent of its lending emissions.”107 Although complaints brought to the OECD are non- judicial, they bring attention to the issue and can influence future legal action.108 However, cases against banks have also been brought to courts. A case was brought against the Dutch Development bank HMO in Dutch courts by the Civil Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) for funding a hydroelectric dam project in Honduras that appropriated land held sacred by the indigenous Lenca people.109 In China, there is an ongoing case brought by an NGO against two Chinese banks for the environmental harm caused by their loans to a pig farm that dumped raw sewage into the Han river.110 The Chinese government has also begun investigating ways to hold lenders liable for environmental harm and is studying the legal systems in other countries to set its own requirements. 111 Rather than funding this devastating industry, U.S. Banks should participate in initiatives to stop deforestation Governments, companies, and financial institutions throughout the world have publicly acknowledged and pledged to take action against deforestation, showing that they are aware of the systemic risks posed by the production of commodities related to deforestation. Still, there is very 105 Id. 106Bushfire Survivors Launch Claim Against ANZ Under International Law for Financing Climate Change, FRIENDS OF THE EARTH AUSTL.

little accountability associated with voluntary pledges. As a result of the World Leader’s Summit at COP26 in 2021, 141 countries covering around 91% of the world’s forests have committed to stop deforestation and begin the reversal process by 2030 through sustainable land use practices, conservation, and forest restoration.112 Additionally, over 30 financial institutions endorsed a statement in November 2021 pledging to “use best efforts to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation activities at the companies in [their] investment portfolios and financing activities by 2025.”113 However, 72% of the 350 largest companies involved in driving deforestation and the 150 leading financial institutions that finance them do not have policies in place recognizing the risks of these problematic commodities.114 And while only 11 out of the 28 companies that published a new commitment since 2021 include a deforestation commitment for the commodities they are exposed to, many companies with commitments fail to explain how they are implementing them.115 In 2010, the Consumer Goods Forum, representing some of the world’s largest companies, pledged to help achieve “zero-net” deforestation in their supply chain by 2020.116 Notwithstanding the much lower commitment of “zero-net” deforestation versus zero deforestation, none of the companies met their goal and many did not even try.117 112 UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONF.

Voluntary pledges are not enough to address climate risks We can’t rely on voluntary pledges and loose guidelines to achieve progress in eliminating deforestation and reducing the risks of climate change to our financial system. The reality is that the banking sector profits enormously from financing deforestation and will continue to do so absent public policy designed to stop it. American banks are not currently bound by mandatory regulations or real legal consequences for their environmentally harmful lending and investment practices. Large banks face an overwhelming lack of accountability which means they have little incentive to take real action in preventing their contribution to deforestation and climate change. Foreign governments have already acknowledged the need for mandatory legislation and regulation to hold banks and companies accountable. In the EU and the UK, legislation is being developed that will require companies “to undertake due diligence on deforestation risk in their supply chains,” and there is mounting pressure “to extend similar requirements to financial institutions.”118 In 2017, France enacted its “Duty of Vigilance” law which requires businesses and banks to “identify, mitigate, and prevent human rights abuses and environmental harms.”119 Again, it remains clear that the United States is lagging too far behind. Environmentally-conscious American banks are far fewer in number, but do exist. These are smaller, regional or specialized banks that acknowledge the environmental impact of investment choices and take care to avoid funding projects that harm the environment. Some of these banks are certified B Corporations, which means they can measure their “entire social and environmental impact.”120 Others are members of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV), which is “a network of independent banks using finance to deliver sustainable economic, 118 GLOB. WITNESS, supra note 85. 119 GLOB. WITNESS, supra note 85. 120Measuring a Company’s Entire Social and Environmental Impact, B CORP., https://www.bcorporation.net/en- us/certification/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 25
social and environmental development.”121 These banks’ successful business models – which include operating ethically and transparently – are placed in jeopardy by their big bank competitors, who profit greatly by investing without added responsibilities.122 The current OCC draft principles are not effective because they do not specifically require that bank management recognize and incorporate the climate risks associated with deforestation and the banks’ own role in facilitating deforestation through its funding activities. If OCC aims to mitigate the risk of climate change to the banking sector it must not only recognize the impacts of climate change on financial risk, but also the impact of the banking sector on climate change. OCC must therefore integrate the deforestation risks of banking activity into the risk governance framework for climate change risks to be meaningfully captured. It should require that financial institutions recognize deforestation as a material climate risk and prioritize deforestation as a criteria impacting financing decisions. It should also mandate banks to analyze and publicly disclose the extent to which they contribute to deforestation. Ultimately, OCC should include a requirement that banks identify their debt and equity financing practices that fund deforestation, and to discontinue these practices. V. To Implement Broad Policy Regarding Climate Change, OCC Must Undergo and Implement a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. Programmatic reviews under the implementing regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are indispensable to implementing broad proposals or planning-level decisions within agencies.123 “Programmatic NEPA reviews assess the environmental impacts of proposed 121 GLOB. ALL. FOR BANKING ON VALUES, https://www.gabv.org/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 122 Ella Nilsen, The Smartest Way to Finance Clean Energy That You’ve Never Heard of, VOX (Jun. 1, 2021), https://www.vox.com/2021/6/1/22454779/green-banks-biden-american-jobs-plan. 123 40 C.F.R. §§ 1500-1508 (2020) (implementing the goals set by Congress in 42 U.S.C. §§ 4331-4347). 26
policies, plans, programs, or projects for which subsequent actions will be implemented.”124 The level of detail in a Programmatic NEPA review is sufficient to allow informed decision-making at the planning stage and leads to development of broad mitigation strategies.125 To fully and adequately address and mitigate climate change-related risks, including those risks posed by deforestation, a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) should be prepared by OCC. Using a PEIS will allow OCC to examine the interaction among proposed actions and to assess cumulative effects of its decisions, including “no action” alternatives, on deforestation and other climate change-related decisions.126 Further, federal courts have often agreed that the use of a PEIS is beneficial to an agency in making long-term, policy-based decisions, enforcing the concept that a PEIS would prove essential to OCC in creating regulations as it proceeds with climate change-related risk mitigation. Utilization of a Programmatic EIS is beneficial for implementing broad policy changes or rulemakings Under the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) 1978 regulations implementing NEPA, Programmatic review via a PEIS or Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA), is best utilized when an agency expects to make broad policy changes or planning-level decisions.127 Programmatic reviews set out the broad, general view of environmental impacts and benefits of a proposed decision or policy.128 As described by CEQ, Programmatic review for repetitive agency activities can “provide a starting point for analyzing direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts” of environmental issues related to broad resolutions.129 Programmatic NEPA reviews, including 124 COUNCIL ON ENV’T. QUALITY, MEMORANDUM: EFFECTIVE USE OF PROGRAMMATIC NEPA REVIEWS 7 (2014). (Council on Environmental Quality hereinafter, CEQ) 125 What is the Difference Between a PEIS and Project-Level EIS?, WASH.

creation of PEISs are governed under the same regulations and guidance which apply to project or site-specific NEPA analyses130. Within the past ten years, legislation trends have encouraged agencies to apply programmatic approaches in NEPA reviews.131 Programmatic NEPA reviews, including use of a PEIS, aid in influencing the nature of subsequent decisions through a tiered approach, allowing for integrated policy or planning framework. After the agency establishes a PEIS to implement policy or rule-making objectives, later tiers in the NEPA process may be tailored to conform to the PEIS analysis to allow narrower investigation into a specific project or issue. In fact, after a PEIS is employed, a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of multiple proposed actions may become clear.132 A PEIS may also be used to “support policy- and planning-level decisions when there are limitations in available information and uncertainty regarding the timing, location, and environmental impacts of subsequent implementing actions(s).”133 The initial use of a PEIS that adequately examines the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a policy, plan, or proposed program could establish parameters for subsequent analyses falling within the scope of the initial PEIS.134 The use of a PEIS can further advance the nation’s environmental policy as articulated in Section 101 of NEPA, by promoting sustainability and incorporating comprehensive mitigation planning to address impacts on a broad programmatic scale.135 130 See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.4(b)-(c)(1978); 40 C.F.R. § 1502.4(b)(2020) (The use of Programmatic review is embedded within the CEQ Regulations that address analyses of “broad actions” and the tiering process.). 131 CEQ, supra note 124, at 4 (citing MAP-21 Section 1305, Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 § 1040). 132 CEQ, supra note 124, at 10. 133 Id. at 11. 134 Id. 135 Id. at 34-35. 28
The 1978 and 2020 changes to CEQ’s Regulations for the Implementation of NEPA Friends of the Earth US acknowledges that NEPA regulations are currently in flux. On July 16, 2020, CEQ issued a final rule rewriting the entirety of its 1978 regulations implementing NEPA (2020 revised regulations).136 More than an update, the 2020 revised regulations upended virtually every aspect of NEPA and its longstanding practices, contradicting decades of court interpretations of NEPA’s mandates and undercutting the reliance placed on NEPA by the public, decision- makers, and project proponents. The 2020 revised regulations limited the scope of actions to which NEPA applies, eviscerated the thorough environmental analysis that lies at the heart of the statute, reduced the ability of the public to participate in federal agency decision-making, and sought to limit judicial review of agency NEPA compliance. All told, the 2020 revised regulations frustrate Congress’s manifest intent in enacting NEPA and threaten human health and the environment. As such, the 2020 revised regulations are facially invalid and the subject of multiple ongoing legal challenges.137 CEQ is in the middle of a two-phase process for reinstating and expanding upon the 1978 implementing regulations, which will have the effect of voiding the 2020 revised regulations.138 To that end, no agency, including OCC, should apply the 2020 revised regulations. Until the pending CEQ regulations are finalized, OCC must rely on the longstanding 136 Update to the Regulations Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 85 Fed. Reg. 43304 (July 16, 2020) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 1500). 137 See Alaska Cmty. Action on Toxics v. Council on Env’t. Quality, 3:20-cv-5199 (N.D. Cal. filed July 29, 2020) (Environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Northern District of California challenging the CEQ’s amendments to NEPA regulations. The plaintiffs asserted that CEQ should have prepared an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the existing regulations to evaluate the amendments’ impacts, including environmental justice impacts and impacts on efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to evaluate how a changing climate affects proposed projects. Plaintiffs also asserted that CEQ failed to comply with NEPA and/or the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to review environmental justice impacts, by violating standards that apply to agency decision-making, by promulgating rules that are contrary to the plain language and purpose of NEPA, and by invalidly attempting to amend statutory thresholds for judicial review.). 138 See CEQ NEPA Regulations, NEPA.GOV, https://ceq.doe.gov/laws-regulations/regulations.html (last visited Feb. 6, 2022). 29
and unchallenged regulations that properly implement NEPA and dictate the agency’s actions in this instance. OCC should conduct a PEIS to implement broad policy or rulemaking to mitigate climate change-related risk To best identify and mitigate “weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate” and produce meaningful obligations for banks to “develop capabilities, deploy resources, and make necessary investments to address climate-related financial risks,” OCC must conduct a PEIS to implement broad policy.139 As addressed in 40 CFR § 1508.1(q)(3)(i-iv) (“Major Federal Actions”), an agency may use Programmatic NEPA review in a decision to adopt official policy or formal plans which result in or substantially alter agency programs, or guide or constrain alternative uses of Federal resources, upon which future agency actions will be based.140 A PEIS performed by OCC would enable the agency to implement broad policy to mitigate the impact of climate change on banks, as well as enable banks to make decisions to mitigate climate change-related risk from the outset. By conducting a PEIS, OCC could use the information generated by the analysis to inform subsequent decisions on investment or financial backing. For example, the use of a PEIS would enable OCC and banks to evaluate whether further investment in agricultural commodities is wise in the face of financed-based climate risk.141 A PEIS would start the process for OCC to mitigate investments in climate-adverse industries at the outset of consideration, and subsequently, related projects could follow suit. 139 OCC, OCC-2021-0023, PRINCIPLES FOR CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR LARGE BANKS 1 (2021). 140 As cited in the 2020 CEQ Regulations. In the 1978 CEQ Regulations the definition of “Major Federal Action” is cited at 40 CFR § 1508.18(b). 141Money to Burn, GLOBAL WITNESS (Sept. 23 2019), https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/forests/money- to-burn-how-iconic-banks-and-investors-fund-the-destruction-of-the-worlds-largest-rainforests/. 30
Through a Programmatic NEPA review that contains sufficient discussion of relevant issues and viewpoints, OCC must take a “hard look” at the environmental effects of the proposed action(s) and make a reasoned choice amongst available alternatives.142 The affected environment in a PEIS may be broadly described and impacts, though temporal, may be discussed with emphasis on cumulative effects.143 As such, OCC should take a “hard look” at the cumulative impacts of its decisions on climate change and climate change-related risk by conducting a PEIS. OCC should conduct a PEIS for climate change-related risk issues as federal courts have held the process is a valid step to implementing broad policy Federal courts look favorably on Programmatic NEPA reviews. The PEIS is recognized by federal courts, which hold them as valuable for analyzing broad environmental impacts. Programmatic NEPA reviews addressing broad, cumulative impacts have been upheld in several circuits. As these courts find PEIS and other programmatic NEPA reviews a valid interpretation of CEQ’s regulations, OCC should further endeavor to conduct a PEIS to analyze the cumulative impacts of its decisions in a step toward implementing broad policy on climate change-related risk. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has characterized a PEIS as “reflecting the broad environmental consequences attendant upon a wide-ranging federal program” and as “look[ing] ahead and assimilat[ing] broad issues relevant to the program.”144 The court also noted that CEQ regulations state that a PEIS should be prepared if actions are “connected, cumulative, or sufficiently similar” and that a PEIS is the best feasible method to assess the combined impacts of similar actions.145 142 NRDC v. Morton, 458 F.2d 827, 838 (D.C. Cir. 1972). 143 CEQ, supra note 124, at 33. 144 Nevada v. Dept. of Energy, 457 F.3d 78, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Found. on Econ. Trends v. Heckler, 756 F.2d 143, 159 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). 145 Nevada, 458 F.2d at 92. 31
When evaluating a PEIS in regard to large scale development, the Eastern District of Tennessee found Tennessee Valley Authority’s use of a PEIS to evaluate changes in vegetation management policies over a large region an appropriate use of the NEPA mechanism.146 The court made clear that a PEIS “may be required when several proposals could have a ‘cumulative or synergistic’ impact within a region.”147 Additionally, the court held that the preparation of a PEIS does not relieve an agency from later preparation of specific action review, but that the general discussions in the PEIS may later be referenced through the tiering process.148 The Ninth Circuit enforced the concept that a PEIS need not include detailed site or action-specific analysis, especially for those providing broad guidelines and no irreversible commitment of resources.149 Most recently, the Arizona District Court visited the concept of the PEIS, in discussing “programmatic attacks” under the APA. The court reiterated that a PEIS is appropriate when actions are “connected, cumulative, or similar.”150 Consequently, as climate change-related risk is the result of “connected, cumulative, or similar” actions via investment or otherwise, OCC should conduct a PEIS adhering to the scope determined by the federal courts. Conclusion Friends of the Earth applauds OCC for acknowledging the impact banks have on global climate and for taking initial steps to hold banks accountable for their actions. But OCC should and must do more to prevent catastrophic outcomes for the environment and our financial system. For all the aforementioned reasons, OCC must undergo a comprehensive rulemaking process, 146 Sherwood v. TVA, No. 12-CV-156, 2021 WL 3276373, at *17-18 (E.D. Tenn.

402,2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-065_29,"Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    The FDIC is proposing that large financial institutions, defined as those with over $100 billion in total  consolidated assets, be subject to a climate-related financial risk management framework. To manage  climate-related financial risks, the FDIC has proposed a framework that would require large banks to  ensure climate-related financial risks are addressed in the bank's (1) governance; (2) policies, procedures  and limits; (3) risk management; and (4) data, risk measurement, and reporting. Additionally, the FDIC  would require large banks to address climate-related financial risk in the following risk areas: (1) credit  risk; (2) liquidity risk; (3) interest rate risk; (4) operational risk; (5) strategic planning; (6) reputational  risk; (7) liability or litigation risk.  I truly believe these steps are an overreach and are not necessary to  manage the safety and soundness of my community bank. In support of this belief I offer the following  reasons. * Existing risk management practices have been proven effective and have enabled community  banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. * Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose  systemic risk to the financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate- related financial risk management framework designed for large, complex institutions. * Compliance  with a climate-related financial risk management framework would be expensive and unnecessarily  duplicates current risk management practices.  The banking industry by its nature is involved in  assessing all types of risks and taking steps to mitigate and monitor risks. These are already incorporated  into our multitude of risk assessments and action plans. For example we monitor severe weather events  and have well established plans to execute. Example is past years of tornado activity in our area of  Missouri. How we have monitored economic factors for our loans which includes climate impact of  drought or too much rain, or hail events in our agriculture sector. Further our assessment of our reserve  for loan loss account we do review all these factors and run projections on potential impact to the loan  portfolio. Therefore, many of these factors sought to be addressed are already being done as normal  practice for banking and community banks in particular. The approach of scenario analysis is an  expensive exercise that requires specialized third-party expertise, and it should not be mandatory for  community banks, given the small size, relative non-complexity and lower risk profile of community  banks as compared to large banks. Finally, as part of the proposal it would require financial institutions  climate data from our customers. This will be extremely challenging and difficult for the customers of  community banks. Many of these customers will not have this information and will refuse to provide  such information. Will this lead us to point where banks will not be allowed to provide services to this  customer base and serve our mostly rural markets and communities? That is a strong and hopefully  unintended consequence of taking such steps and actions.    John Denkler   Farmington, MO","The comment by John Denkler addresses the FDIC's proposal for large financial institutions to adopt a climate-related financial risk management framework. Denkler argues that this framework is unnecessary for community banks, which do not pose systemic risks and already have effective risk management practices in place. He contends that the proposed measures would be costly, duplicative, and inappropriate for smaller banks, which already monitor climate-related risks through existing practices. Denkler highlights that community banks, unlike large institutions, have a lower risk profile and should not be subjected to a one-size-fits-all approach. He also raises concerns about the requirement for banks to collect climate data from customers, which could be challenging and potentially lead to unintended consequences, such as limiting services to rural communities. Denkler emphasizes that community banks are already adept at managing various risks, including those related to climate, through established procedures."

This seems like spitting into the wind as the lowly tiny voices of the peon working class members of society are seldom considered when dealing with, well, pretty much anything in our country but here goes - it is beyond vital that we make drastic changes to thwart the looming climate disaster and one way to do that is by getting banks to limit their funding of fossil fuel corporations and companies. 
Put that money towards developing alternative power sources - lord knows that there can be billions made in those markets if the funding can be applied there rather than in dirty fossil fuels.

I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.

Everyone has been responsible or climate change, and it's up to everyone to change the projectory that we are on to clean up Mother Earth.
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, as stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;

Gruenberg Acting Chair, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 550 17th St. NW Washington, DC 20429 June 3, 2022 Re: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions Dear Acting Chair Gruenberg, On behalf of the 67 undersigned organizations and our millions of members and supporters, we welcome the opportunity to comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions. We support this important step toward advancing financial institutions’ efforts to assess and address climate-related risk, and we urge the FDIC to strengthen and finalize the draft as soon as possible. Climate change poses significant risks to the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the financial system, and communities. We support the FDIC’s recommendations for large financial institutions to take a whole-of-business approach to mitigating climate risk, to consider longer time horizons for assessing and addressing climate risk, and to develop climate-related data and scenario analysis modeling. We also welcome the provisions directing these financial institutions to align their internal strategies with their public climate commitments and to recognize the fair lending implications of their risk-management measures and their adverse effects on low-income and other disadvantaged households and communities. Nevertheless, we are concerned that the Statement does not directly acknowledge that: (1) nearly all of the financial institutions regulated by the FDIC are community banks and savings associations — financial institutions disproportionately threatened by climate change; and (2) large US financial institutions not only face significant climate-related risks, but also fuel the risks through their financing of greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting activities. The Statement should acknowledge these realities and explicitly recognize that large financial institutions — through their financing and facilitating of emissions — are threatening the safety and soundness of other important FDIC-regulated financial entities, as well as the financial system. This acknowledgment will lay the groundwork for the FDIC to cooperate with other federal banking regulators to protect the safety and soundness of the banking system.
We also urge the FDIC to provide greater clarity around what it means for large financial institutions to align their climate commitments to their internal strategies, and to provide even greater attention to fair lending concerns fueled by climate risk management. Acknowledging the need for large financial institutions to stop enabling climate change The FDIC is mandated to ensure the safety and soundness of approximately 4,000 community banks and savings associations in the US, many of which are critically important for low and moderate income communities. One in five counties depends on community banks for access to a physical bank branch. And, yet, the Statement targets climate risks to only large financial institutions - of which the FDIC regulates only a handful. This focus draws inadequate attention to the fact that community banks and savings associations are particularly vulnerable to climate change-related impacts. One federal advisory committee explained that this vulnerability is due to community banks’ focus on agriculture, residential, and commercial real estate lending, and their reduced capacity to move or shift portfolios. This committee observed that climate-related sub-systemic shocks to communities and, in turn, to community banks, are creating a systemic crisis in slow motion. The FDIC is understandably seeking to tailor expectations for small banks to reflect their circumstances. But this Statement is an opportunity to acknowledge the fact that protecting small banks and the deposit fund requires addressing the risks that large banks are facilitating. The Statement acknowledges that climate-related financial risks can be transmitted to a significant number of financial institutions and raise financial stability concerns. Indeed, the Statement rightly defines climate-related financial risks as a clear and significant risk to the U.S. financial system and a near-term threat to safe and sound banking and financial stability. When banks finance the creation of heightened climate-related risks, they contribute to this threat. This is exactly what the largest US banks are doing. The Banking on Climate Chaos report and other studies have demonstrated that large US banks, through their financing and facilitating of fossil fuel-related activities and other high-emitting projects, contribute significantly to GHG emissions and, in turn, exacerbate climate-related risks. Similar to bank action during the subprime mortgage crisis, banks supporting fossil fuel-related activities are creating risks that other entities are left to deal with. The Statement should recognize that orderly reductions in such financing and support would meaningfully reduce safety and soundness risks for all financial institutions — large and small — as well as the risks of impaired access to financial services for all communities and risks to the financial system. Because few of the banks that must make these reductions are under the FDIC’s primary jurisdiction, the Statement should be
followed by an interagency guidance from all federal banking regulators detailing the risks that financed emissions create, and how to reduce those risks. Ensuring transparency and alignment of climate commitments and strategies We welcome the provision directing financial institutions to ensure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public statements, given that many large US financial institutions - including FDIC-regulated Truist bank - have publicly committed to creating and executing “net-zero” transition plans. However, to ensure that this provision contributes to meaningful climate-related risk management, greater detail is necessary. To date, many US banks that have made commitments to “net-zero” emissions by 2050, including members of the bank-led Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) initiative under the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), are falling short of establishing strategies to meet these commitments, and are still engaging in actions inconsistent with them. Financial institutions are continuing to finance new fossil fuel activities, other high-emitting projects, and companies expanding high-emitting activities. This financing is not compatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 or limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. This conduct raises questions about whether financial institution managers desire to follow through on these commitments or are merely seeking public relations wins. To meet its public commitments, a financial institution’s corresponding actions and internal strategies must be grounded in climate science and technological realities. The FDIC should clarify what it means in practice for large financial institutions to align their net-zero transition plan commitments with their internal strategies. Among the most significant parameters to expand on are (1) providing measurable near-term targets based firmly in climate science and technological realities; (2) aligning financial institution financing with the institution’s own commitments to net-zero emissions; and (3) accurately accounting for the challenges posed by offsets. Measurable Targets The FDIC should make clear that financial institutions committing to net zero by 2050 must have in place, and must implement, credible internal strategies that meet the imperatives of climate science, technological realities, and safety and soundness. A credible plan in line with public commitments includes short- and medium-term targets and metrics. Such milestones are
critical not just to meeting the commitments, but also to avoiding a fire sale from financial institutions trying to meet their commitments at the last minute. A credible plan should include milestones such as a 50% reduction in absolute financed emissions by 2030 and should be publicly available. Aligning Financing Activity to Emissions Reductions Targets The expansion of fossil fuel production is not compatible with any science-based limit on global temperature rise or with meeting public commitments for net-zero financed emissions by 2050. Key tenets of the International Energy Agency’s roadmap for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 include “no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects” and “no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants.” Yet, as indicated by the recent Banking on Climate Chaos report, U.S. financial institutions are the most significant financiers of fossil fuels globally, and have continued to increase their funding despite voicing their support for the Paris Agreement and committing to net zero by 2050. Such contradictions raise serious questions about the sincerity of financial institutions’ climate commitments or, alternatively, the soundness of their management processes and controls. To meaningfully align their internal strategies and their commitments, financial institutions need to switch to a science-based approach to meeting absolute emissions reduction targets. We urge the FDIC to work with all regulators to adopt a consistent approach to overseeing alignment of climate commitments in line with these recommendations. . Offsets Some institutions may seek to rely heavily on purported “offsets” of carbon emissions from forests, wetlands, and carbon removal technologies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. But offsets have such deep limitations that they cannot be relied on to play more than a trivial role in any credible net-zero plan. The limitations include difficulties quantifying or verifying avoided or reduced emissions, questions about the effectiveness and permanence of natural sinks that may be threatened by human or natural impacts, concerns about the reliability and legal norm compliance of promised reductions due to violations of Indigenous rights and treaties, the lack of technologies that are credible and dependable, and the potential for fraud. For these reasons, climate commitment standard setters are increasingly treating offsets as only a last resort to negate residual emissions that remain after financial institutions have directly reduced financed emissions as near to zero as is possible.
Questions about the integrity of offsets have stymied efforts by Mark Carney and others to advance the carbon offset market, and also prompted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to begin examining the integrity of offsets-related claims. Given these challenges, regulators should understand how banks are assessing offsets as part of their climate commitments, and carefully scrutinize plans that rely on offsets for reductions of more than a residual level of emissions. Ensuring fair access to financial services We welcome the FDIC’s attention to potential fair lending concerns as financial institutions reduce their own exposures to climate change-related credit and other financial risks. Financial institutions are increasingly likely, for example, to reduce financing  in “hot-spot” areas and for assets threatened by climate-related extreme weather events — following the lead of insurers who are restricting or raising the price of coverage in hotspot areas. Costs related to financing in these areas are likely to increase, which will slow these communities’ ability to recover and adapt, further entrenching climate-exacerbated racial and economic inequalities. The FDIC’s recent proposal to revise Community Reinvestment Act rules recognizes several of these challenges. The FDIC correctly calls on financial institutions to reduce or mitigate the impact that risk management may have on broader aspects of the economy, including disproportionate impact on disadvantaged communities. It should move quickly to issue additional guidance on how financial institutions can improve on providing credit to vulnerable communities equitably while acting in a safe and sound manner. As part of this guidance, the agency should call on  financial institutions to identify, measure, monitor, and address potential and actual disproportionate impacts on marginalized  communities, such as communities of color and low-moderate-income communities, and have a system for tracking the progress of their actions to avoid or address disproportionate impacts. It should also reiterate that banks cannot exacerbate climate-related financial risks with their willingness to finance high emissions activities, and then pull back from the communities harmed by the climate impacts their financing has fueled. Such conduct cannot be a path to prudently meeting the financial services needs of their communities. Conclusion These draft principles are an important step in the right direction. They are also only a starting point that should be followed by additional guidance. The U.S. lags behind much of the world on mitigating climate-related risk. We encourage the FDIC to take the lead with its global peers
at the European Central Bank (ECB), Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and other regulators who are actively exploring the need for additional supervisory measures to respond to climate risk, including the need for increased attention to capital and liquidity requirements at the largest, most complex institutions. We look forward to continuing to engage with you on these issues. For questions, please contact Anne Perrault at aperrault@citizen.org and Yevgeny Shrago at yshrago@citizen.org.

395,2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-065_22,"Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am sending this correspondence in response to the FDIC's request on its statement of principles of  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the Community President  of First Option Bank in Louisburg, KS, as well as on our Sr. Management Team that has banks in  communities surrounding the Kansas City Metro in Kansas and Missouri. Most of our banks are in  communities of less than 6000 people. We are a $600 Million community bank providing home loans,  small business and commercial loans, consumer loans and agriculture loans. In several of the  communities we are the most active lender remaining with a full service bank. After reading what you  have proposed, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-risk management to  banks like ours, a small community bank. This proposed framework would negatively impact my  communities. Community Banks with any exposure to agriculture have always been impacted by  climate-related risks. We've always accounted for those issues. Community Banks do not pose a  systemic risk to the financial system and a 'one size fits all' framework that is designed for large complex  institutions that do not know their clients well, or who do not live in the areas where climate impacts  occur regularly, could seriously affect our institution and the communities we serve. Dealing with the  costs and complexity of compliance as it currently is, and add something of this magnitude, and I feel  the expense would be insurmountable and unnecessarily duplicate our current risk management  practices. Weather has always played a role in our current practices when assessing loan loss provisions  and credit management. Living in Kansas, severe weather has always played a part in our daily lives.  Bankers in Kansas have always rallied to support their communities when tornados or other severe  weather incidents occur. With the adoption of CECL, we're already assessing risks such as climate, with  the booking of each loan. This proposed regulation would create additional response and costs to what  we're already doing. I personally thank you for limiting the proposal currently to banks over the $100  billion in asset threshold and I strongly encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community  bankers to understand why this proposal should never trickle down to community banks.    Mark P. Williams   Louisburg, KS","Mark P. Williams, Community President of First Option Bank in Louisburg, KS, expresses concerns about the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework for large financial institutions. He argues that applying this framework to small community banks, like his, would negatively impact their operations and communities. Williams highlights that community banks, especially those with agricultural exposure, already account for climate-related risks and do not pose systemic risks to the financial system. He criticizes the 'one size fits all' approach, designed for large institutions, as potentially burdensome and costly for small banks. Williams emphasizes that Kansas bankers are accustomed to managing weather-related risks and that the proposed regulation would unnecessarily duplicate existing risk management practices. He appreciates the current limitation of the proposal to banks with over $100 billion in assets and urges the FDIC to engage with community bankers to prevent the regulation from affecting smaller banks."
411,2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-065_36,"Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing this comment letter regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles  for climate-related financial risk management for large institutions. New Market Bank is a small  community bank with assets of approximately $190MM (prior to the pandemic we were only  approximately $125MM in assets). We have three locations in Elko New Market, Lakeville and Prior Lake  which are suburbs of the southern Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN metro area. We have 40 people on our  team in total which includes everyone from tellers at all our locations to me who is CEO, President and  CFO of our small organization. Most of the loans we make are to small businesses that help to either  finance larger purchases such as buildings or equipment to smaller operating lines of credit. We also  have a 2nd market mortgage department which consists of 7 of those 40 team members.  The main  reason that I am submitting a comment letter is because I am concerned the FDIC may in the future  apply this climate-related financial risk management framework to community banks. Community banks  do not pose a systemic risk to the financial system and already work hard to implement risk  management practices that are effective to managing the safety and soundness of our institutions.  These risk management practices already have considerations for potential climate-related risks woven  into the program. For example, the recent adoption of CECL requires banks to have a forward-looking  approach to risks on the economy through use of qualitative factors. Along with CECL, community banks  also have implemented stress testing on their loan portfolio to understand how various stress levels  would affect the level of reserves the bank would need to survive.  The most concerning part of the  proposal however is the scenario analysis exercise. The idea that a community bank may have to  eventually complete a scenario analysis that explores the impacts of climate-related risk on our strategy  and business model as well as identify and measure vulnerability to relevant climate-related risk factors  including physical and transition risk is overwhelming to say the least. This analysis would no doubt force  us to hire a 3rd party as we would not have the expertise on our team to complete the exercise  internally. It appears that in order to complete such a scenario analysis, we would also need to gather  climate data from our customers which could be nearly impossible as small businesses do not maintain  this data and would also have an objection to starting to collect it and then having to disclose it to us.  Finally, the results of the analysis would most likely not have any practical use for us as the likelihood of  these climate-related risks are remote and the impact is minimal. This exercise would just place another  expense burden on community banks which in turn decreases earnings and makes it harder to compete  against other larger financial institutions.  In conclusion, I sincerely hope the information provided in this  comment letter helps you to understand the challenges smaller community banks would face in  complying with a climate-related risk management program. The cost of implementing such a program  would be significant to a smaller institution with no real identifiable benefit. I appreciate the 
opportunity to share my comments and concerns. If there is any additional information that I could  provide that would help you understand the impact this potential rule could have on a community bank,  I am happy to be a resource.    Thank you,    Anita Drentlaw  CEO/President/CFO   Prior Lake, MN","Anita Drentlaw, CEO/President/CFO of New Market Bank, expresses concerns over the FDIC's climate-related financial risk management principles potentially being applied to community banks. She argues that community banks, like hers, do not pose systemic risks and already incorporate climate-related considerations into their risk management practices. Drentlaw highlights the challenges of conducting scenario analyses, which would require external expertise and customer climate data, posing a significant burden on small banks. She believes the costs of implementing such a program would outweigh the benefits, as the likelihood and impact of climate-related risks are minimal for community banks. Drentlaw urges the FDIC to consider the financial strain and competitive disadvantage this could impose on smaller institutions."

196,kzk-00bg-hro0,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks.
The banks need to be reminded that there are no profits on a dead planet.
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
This is greenwashing of the worst kind. Public lies, corporate profits.
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;

0,kxa-gdxf-5l0y,"The OCC should not have regulations related to climate change as they affect banks.  This is no different than banks not having regulations how their investments are affected by sunspots, animal evolution, shifting consumer preferences, or other specific external factors.  External factors always come into play into any decision, and singling out climate change as one that rises to the importance of requiring a policy appears to be purely political and not related to any relevant century-long event that affects investments on the relatively short term time horizon that banks lend money or make investment decisions on.  And although these regulations would initially apply to only banks of larger than $100 billion, as we all know, regulation creep seems to percolate downward into smaller banks who are ill equipped to deal with an unnecessary burden amongst all other other regulatory burdens that are placed on them.","The commenter argues against the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) implementing regulations related to climate change for banks. They compare climate change to other external factors like sunspots and consumer preferences, suggesting that singling out climate change is politically motivated rather than based on its relevance to short-term investment decisions.

We believe that Final Guidance closely based on the Draft Principles would effectively support and provide the needed flexibility to advance the efforts of financial institutions with respect to their climate-related financial risk management. We appreciate this opportunity to provide additional thoughts and look forward to engaging in further conversations on this topic with you. A. IIB’s Distinctive Perspective The IIB represents internationally headquartered financial institutions from over 35 countries around the world doing business in the United States. The IIB’s members consist principally of international banks that operate branches and agencies, bank subsidiaries, and broker-dealer subsidiaries in the United States. Our members believe that financial institutions have an important role to play in facilitating the climate-related transition objectives of their clients and approach the topic of climate change and financial risk from an international perspective. Many of our members are headquartered in jurisdictions where financial regulators are in the process of implementing, or have implemented, regulations and supervisory expectations pertaining to climate-related financial risk. For instance, regulators in some of the jurisdictions of our members have formally assessed how financial institutions are managing climate- 1 OCC, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021). ___________________________________________________________________ The Institute’s mission is to help resolve the many special legislative, regulatory and tax issues confronting internationally headquartered financial institutions that engage in banking, securities and/or insurance activities in the United States. ___________________________________________________________________
related financial risk as compared to supervisory expectations or are asking financial institutions to conduct scenario analyses. In addition, many of our members already have deployed considerable resources toward the management of climate-related financial risk, including by developing greater internal climate risk management expertise (such as hiring dedicated personnel and teams), modeling and undertaking scenario analyses, and engaging with regulators on these issues. We come to this Request for Feedback with enthusiasm about what principles-based, internationally consistent climate risk management guidance stands to achieve. We believe that a principles-based Final Guidance provides the best avenue for allowing financial institutions to make tailored risk management decisions and operate under multiple international regulatory regimes. As organizations in the business of managing risk, financial institutions are uniquely well-suited to help their clients meet their climate objectives and manage the challenges that a transition to a lower carbon economy could entail, while remaining focused on the financial institution’s own management of physical and transition risks. Financial institutions have a role to play in the efforts of their clients to further climate-related transition objectives, including those clients operating in traditionally carbon-intensive industries. Participation in these efforts likely will take different forms and differ among financial institutions across timelines and geographies. Consequently, flexible, principles-based guidance – in contrast to prescriptive requirements2 – maximizes the chances that financial institutions can bring innovation and resources to better support the climate-related transitions of their clients. We would be pleased to meet with you to discuss the Request for Feedback and provide you with information about practices in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as our experiences with clients and other regulators. Further, under the understanding that the federal banking regulators are in dialog on this issue, we have copied the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) on this letter. We also have copied the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”), which has also been focusing on climate-related risk management. Below, we offer some additional considerations and request some key clarifications in relation to the issuance of any Final Guidance. B. The Final Guidance Should Continue to Recognize that Methodologies, Models, and Data for Analyzing Climate-Related Financial Risk Remain a Work in Progress We appreciate the OCC’s acknowledgement in the Draft Principles that “incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time.” As the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s (“FSOC”) recent report similarly notes, “Defining, identifying, measuring, and monitoring exposures to climate-related financial risks will necessitate investment in data and analytic capacity by FSOC members, other government agencies, and the private sector.”3 2 As Governor Brainard has stated in the context of climate risk, “We would not tell banks which sectors to lend to or which sector to not lend.” See also Board Chair Jerome Powell, as quoted in Law360 (Jan. 11, 2022) (“Climate is appropriate for us as an issue to the extent it fits within our existing mandates. I think it does, in the sense of it’s another risk over time that banks are going to run. But the broader answer to climate change has to come from legislators and the private sector”). 3 FSOC, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021). 2
Methodologies, models, and data for analyzing climate-related financial risk remain a work in progress. To take the example of data gaps, financial institutions are both producers and consumers of data. A financial institution can only fully evaluate its own financial risks by drawing upon relevant and appropriate data situated outside the financial institution’s own operations. Such data must be collected from its clients, counterparties, and transactions, and there is no question that consistent and comparable data is not always easily available and does not always exist.4 For example, broad corporate public disclosure lacks standardization, rigor, and granularity, and forward-looking data from clients on their transition plans is weak at best. While these sources mature, banks must continue to rely upon approximations and extrapolations derived from less direct data sources. We believe that financial institutions should continue working to identify and understand gaps in methodologies, models, and data. As Acting Comptroller Hsu suggested in a recent speech, the risk management processes of banks and the questions that their boards should start posing to management can have an important role in illuminating gaps in information and tools.5 These endeavors will be non- trivial given the multitude of overlapping, often inconsistent, and rapidly evolving private and public sector definitions and measurement approaches to climate risk, reporting regimes, and the vetting of numerous regionally limited third-party data offerings. Even as data becomes more available, the proliferation of definitions and measurement approaches could complicate the efforts of financial institutions to incorporate this information into their risk management frameworks. Thus, such efforts will take time and likely will necessitate cooperation between regulators and the financial services industry. Scenario analysis as a risk management tool also remains in development, and the accuracy and effectiveness of scenario analysis depends on the availability of high-quality data, as well as advancements in modeling over medium and long time horizons. The Draft Principles make clear that scenario analysis is just one tool alongside others in enhancing climate-related financial risk management. Any Final Guidance should continue this position, and additionally make clear that scenario analysis is a separate exercise, distinct from traditional stress testing, and is not intended to affect capital requirements or supervisory actions regarding U.S. operations. We believe that attempts by other jurisdictions to incorporate scenario analysis into stress tests or capital requirements are premature6 and have created confusion based on how nascent measurement methodologies and data would influence current capital requirements. To maximize the potential effectiveness of any guidance related to scenario analysis, we would urge further dialog between regulators and industry. We would be pleased to discuss our experiences with scenario analysis in other jurisdictions with the OCC. 4 Like the OCC, domestic and international regulators and standard-setting bodies have acknowledged the data gaps that affect the measurement of climate-related financial risk. Reports by a number of authorities have emphasized this important issue. See, e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), Climate-related financial risks – measurement methodologies (Apr. 14, 2021); Networking for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), Progress report on bridging data gaps (June 3, 2021); Financial Stability Board, The Availability of Data with Which to Monitor and Assess Climate-Related Risks to Financial Stability (July 7, 2021); FSOC, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021); European Systemic Risk Board, Positively green: Measuring climate change risks to financial stability (June 8, 2020); Climate Financial Risk Forum, Climate Data and Metrics, (Oct. 21, 2021). See also Board Gov. Lael Brainard, “Building Climate Scenario Analysis on the Foundations of Economic Research” (Oct. 7, 2021). 5 Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu, “Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask” (Nov. 8, 2021). 6 See, e.g., Sec. Janet Yellen, as quoted in Bloomberg Law (Feb. 2, 2022) (“It’s just premature at this point to talk about raising capital requirements . . . it’s really important that regulators do the groundwork that’s necessary for them to evaluate risks to individual firms”) and Board Gov. Lael Brainard, “The Role of Financial Institutions in Tackling the Challenges of Climate Change” (Feb. 18, 2021) (“To be clear, scenario analysis is distinct from our traditional regulatory stress tests at banks”). 3
If finalized largely as written, the Draft Principles would allow sufficient leeway for, and encourage, the continued development of methods, models, and data to quantify and understand climate- related financial risks. C. Domestic and International Cooperation Around Consistent and Comparable Climate Change Risk Management Principles Is Critical The risks and effects of climate change are rarely confined within state or national borders, making dialog and coordination among regulators essential. Disparate initiatives on climate-related financial risks among various jurisdictions could lead to circumstances in which different sets of requirements result in inefficient and duplicative efforts (or even worse, conflict with each other). We applaud the OCC for its international work (e.g., participation in the NGFS as well as the BCBS’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks), its climate-related work under the FSOC umbrella, and other initiatives such as the creation of the Climate Change Risk Officer position, one of the aims of which was to expand the OCC’s capacity to coordinate with stakeholders, and more. We urge the OCC to continue its coordination efforts among U.S. and international regulators (as the OCC indicated it would in development of the Final Guidance), as well as its dialog with industry participants. To foster clarity and efficiency, the Final Guidance should reflect the aggregate views of the U.S. prudential regulators (the Board, the FDIC, and the OCC) and, to the extent possible, consistency with state-level regulators. Inconsistent or uncoordinated guidance is likely to come at the expense of effective risk management. Internationally headquartered financial institutions develop their risk management and strategic decisions for the consolidated organization at the level of head office, and the institution is subject to the laws and regulations of a non-U.S. jurisdiction on a consolidated, enterprise-wide basis. Consequently, a key consideration for an internationally headquartered financial institution is whether it can use the work that the financial institution does to understand, quantify, and manage climate-related financial risk in one jurisdiction across the organization to meet the expectations of other jurisdictions. Final Guidance that is flexible and principles-based, as the Draft Principles are, will allow for the development of methodologies, models, and data that are fit for multiple purposes across entities and geographies, including both host and home country supervisory expectations. Moreover, additional multinational and international frameworks for data, risk measurement, and other key financial institution tasks will undoubtedly be developed and adopted, and we urge the OCC to maintain sufficient flexibility such that a financial institution’s adoption of those international standards will exhibit compliance with U.S. regulatory expectations as well. We believe that Final Guidance that incorporates the principles-based expectations of the Draft Principles would provide internationally headquartered financial institutions with the necessary flexibility to consider the regulatory postures of their home countries and of internationally agreed upon standards. Even in the context of internationally consistent and comparable risk management guidance, issues will remain that should be addressed through cooperation among regulators. To name just a few examples, entities within an affiliated financial institution group that are subject to the rules of different jurisdictions are likely to encounter inconsistent timing requirements for implementation or for meeting regulatory expectations. Furthermore, the Draft Principles, like other climate-related financial risk management pronouncements by international regulators and standard-setters, use the term “material.” Guidance from the OCC and other U.S. regulators should clarify that each institution should be able to make decisions of materiality based on its own facts, circumstances, geographical footprint, home country regulator, and other similar factors. In addition, “materiality” also has a specific meaning in the securities law context, and regulators should acknowledge that the investor focus of the securities laws and their disclosure requirements (including conservative development of forward-looking risk factors) does not 4
necessarily equate to what may be material for safety, soundness, and risk management purposes. These competing meanings of “materiality” provide just one example of the importance of flexible, principles- based guidance. D. Any Final Guidance Should Consider the Unique Structure and Governance of Internationally Headquartered Financial Institutions An important undercurrent to our comments is the theme of adaptability and iteration. We believe that flexible, principles-based Final Guidance in the same vein as the Draft Principles would best accommodate the ever-evolving climate risk management landscape. Supervisory activity stemming from the Final Guidance also should consider the reality that best practices around climate-related financial risk management remain in development and should support rather than dictate the efforts of firms to refine, readjust, and revisit their approaches in light of evolving capabilities and circumstances. To that end, any Final Guidance should constitute “guidance” under the OCC’s framework for guidance.7 We also would expect that the OCC would provide reasonable timeframes for banks to incorporate the principles of the Final Guidance into their risk management processes. Rather than require conformance with the new guidance by a certain date, the Final Guidance should focus on ensuring that banks are working effectively, in good faith, to establish and evolve their climate-related financial risk management practices. Any timeframes for implementing the Final Guidance should reflect and accommodate the iterative nature of climate-related financial risk management, particularly given limitations with respect to models, methodology, and data, as well as potential compliance obligations in different jurisdictions. We applaud the OCC for its statement that it will tailor the Final Guidance “to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.” There are many different factors that shape a bank’s climate-related financial risk profile (for example, even institutions that are the same size could have very different climate-related risk exposures). As previously mentioned, for internationally headquartered banks operating in the United States, the unique structure of their operations reflects a further need for appropriate tailoring to take into account the fact that enterprise-wide risk management principles, analyses, and business strategies are established by a bank’s board and management at head office, and any risk management policies, procedures, and principles applied in the United States must necessarily be consistent with those enterprise-wide mandates. We also would ask that the OCC clarify that the Draft Principles (and subsequent Final Guidance) apply only to federal branches / agencies that have over $100 billion in total consolidated assets at the branch or the agency level and, separately, to internationally headquartered national bank subsidiaries of financial institutions that have over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. We believe that Final Guidance that reflects the principles-based approach of the Draft Principles would be helpful and effective. If there is any material development of the Draft Principles beyond the high-level approach already taken (as we note that the OCC indicated that it likely would present a more granular Final Guidance taking into account additional views from the Board and FDIC, as well as further research into climate-related financial risk management), we would expect that these developments would be open to additional review and comment to give industry and other stakeholders the chance to weigh in on these important issues. * * * 7 OCC, Role of Supervisory Guidance, 86 Fed.

320,2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-005,"May 12, 2022    Mr. James P. Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429    Re:       Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (RIN 3064-ZA32)    Dear Mr. Sheesley,     Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”), on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, appreciates the opportunity to  comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) draft principles for a high-level framework for  management of climate-related financial risks.1  We address our comments to several specific questions asked by  the FDIC with regards to these draft principles.   As discussed below, ICE is supportive of sustainable and impact  investing and regulatory initiatives designed to improve transparency and comparability.   We believe that our five decades of experience providing evaluated pricing and related reference data and  metrics covering millions of fixed income securities, which are largely held by financial institutions, can provide  useful insights into ESG-related practices.       Background on ICE   ICE, through its ICE Data Services business unit, is a leading provider of evaluated end-of-day and continuous   pricing services on approximately three million fixed income securities spanning approximately 150 countries  and 80 currencies including sovereign, corporate and municipal bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities as  well as leveraged loans. ICE’s reference data complements this evaluated pricing by providing our clients a broad  range of descriptive information, covering millions of financial instruments. ICE’s ESG data covers a wide range  of financial instruments including equities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS)  and loans.  Our municipal ESG data covers over 40 different demographic and workplace metrics which indicate  the potential social impact of investment in a given municipality.  In addition, these metrics are mapped to the  UN Sustainable Development Goals to provide users a means to look at their impact within a commonly  understood framework.  Our company ESG data2 includes widely reported and comparable ESG attributes and    1 https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22013.html  2 https://www.theice.com/data-services/esg-data/esg-reference-data   
    2    indicators (over 500), which can help users better understand ESG risks and opportunities of global corporations.    In addition, for most securitized products and municipal securities, ICE offers climate risk data3 on the exposure  of these securities to climate risks. This service can help users quantify climate risk exposure and make strategic  decisions across portfolios by maturity, obligor or geographical boundary.  Finally, ICE’s terms and conditions  data service4 includes classification of green, social and sustainable bonds, as well as details of any second party  opinion that confirms the status of the bond.       Climate-Related Financial Risk Time Horizons  The FDIC requests comment on what time horizons are appropriate for financial institutions to consider when  assessing the materiality of their climate-related financial risks.  In our experience, it is important to consider  multiple time horizons when evaluating the impact of climate-related financial risks.  Moreover, we observe our  clients commonly analyzing climate exposures over different time horizons for different asset types.  For  example, for short-duration instruments, our clients may refer to current exposure and the exposure at 1 or 2  years out.  For mortgage-related assets, the 7- and 10-year time horizons are very common focal points,  whereas real estate and municipal bond owners tend to look at 10- to 30-year time horizons. Climate risk should  not be viewed purely through a future lens, however, there are also material risks to real estate and  infrastructure now that should be considered. In addition, policy changes like FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0 that was  initialized in October 2021 are expected to create inflationary pressure on housing costs through changes in  flood insurance premiums. Such changes may impact liquidity in the residential real estate market that could in  turn exert downward pressure on value of certain real estate markets.5  In addition, acceleration in wildfire risk  over the past several years is also leading to changes in the willingness of insurers to underwrite wildfire policies  for vulnerable real estate,6 potentially adding risk to banks holding loans. Financial institutions should be aware  of how these kinds of policy changes and market dynamics could dovetail with actual measurements of physical  climate risk.  We suggest that the FDIC recommend financial institutions consider a wide array of climate exposure time  horizons when quantifying the materiality to their institution.    Scenario Analysis of Climate-Related Financial Risks  The FDIC requests comment on several aspects of scenario analysis with regards to climate risk management,  including what challenges exist today and what factors should be considered when designing and executing a  scenario analysis.  ICE notes that there are well-understood climate scenario analysis tools available to the    3 https://www.theice.com/data-services/esg-data/climate-risk  4 https://www.theice.com/market-data/pricing-and-analytics/reference-data/terms-and-conditions  5 https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2021/10/08/flood-insurance-is-changing-for-property-owners-heres-what-real- estate-clients-should-know-414-210980/?slreturn=20220318112500  6 https://www.wsj.com/articles/wildfire-risk-in-california-drives-insurers-to-pull-policies-for-pricey-homes-11642593601 
    3    industry.  For example, the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)7 has established  Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP),8 which are pathway scenarios commonly utilized for climate  modeling and research.  These well-defined scenarios range from RCP 2.6 (representing the aspirational goals of  the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2100) through RCP 8.5 (considered by some to be the  worst-case scenario for climate change with expectations of projected warming exceeding 4°C by 2100).    These types of standardized, readily available scenarios can be incorporated into financial institutions’ scenario  analyses workflows and assist these entities in better understanding the potential of their climate-related  financial risks.    Additional Tools and Approaches for Risk Management of Climate-Related Risks  The FDIC discusses various risk management tools that are available today to financial institutions including  exposure analysis, heat maps, climate risk dashboards, and scenario analysis.  The FDIC goes on to inquire about  specific tools or strategies that financial institutions use to successfully manage climate-related risks.  ICE believes that all of these tools mentioned above add value to an institution’s analysis and management of  climate-related risks.   For example, dashboards and heat maps may be more appropriate for senior managers,  whereas exposure and scenario analysis are generally more appropriate for the managers more actively focused  on mitigating climate risks.     From our experience as a climate risk data provider, we strongly believe that the underlying thread that ties  these tools together is the validation of underlying assumptions utilized.  We regularly have clients asking us to  validate and compare our projections to actual outcomes once realized.  Therefore, we believe that the FDIC  should explicitly require financial institutions to research, outline, and detail the correlation between climate  risks and the financial risks to which they are exposed, and provide transparency into the data utilized to  validate any assumptions that underlie their models.      Application of Climate-Related Risks to Credit and Liquidity Risk Management  The FDIC highlights in these draft principles that a sound risk governance framework allows a financial institution  to identify and mitigate climate-related risks in various risk categories (e.g. credit risk, liquidity risk, operational  risk, etc.).  The FDIC further suggests that additional risk assessment principles will be provided in subsequent  guidance.  We caution the FDIC about being overly prescriptive in the application of climate-related financial risks to other  risk categories.  As a service provider in both the climate and liquidity space, ICE is still looking for ways to  appropriately incorporate climate events into its liquidity models, and correlations are quite difficult to apply on  a macro level.  With liquidity models that are broadly driven by underlying risk factors such as bid-ask spreads,  price volatility, depth of asset holders, and observed trading volumes (each of which are highly positively    7 The IPCC was established in 1988 and is comprised of 195 member states.  8 The RCP measure greenhouse gas concentration trajectories through the year 2100 and each of these RCP describe  different potential climate future scenarios. 
    4    correlated to liquidity), it is complicated to apply climate risk to these factors in a quantitatively, data-driven  way.      Conversely, on the credit risk side, there is ample data proving a strong correlation to climate risks and property  values, these data can be utilized to quantitatively model both an increase in the probability of default, as well  as the loss-given default assumptions used in credit modelling.       Conclusion  ICE appreciates the opportunity to share our thoughts on this important topic, and hope that our  recommendations are helpful as the FDIC develops a framework for the safe and sound management by  financial institutions of exposures to climate-related financial risks.  We would be happy to discuss these  suggestions in greater detail with FDIC representatives if that would be useful.    Respectfully submitted,   Anthony Belcher, Vice President, Sustainable Finance  Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE) provides feedback on the FDIC's draft principles for managing climate-related financial risks for large financial institutions. ICE supports sustainable investing and regulatory initiatives for transparency. They highlight their expertise in providing pricing and ESG data for financial instruments, which can aid in understanding ESG risks. ICE emphasizes the importance of considering multiple time horizons for assessing climate risks, noting that different asset types require different time frames. They suggest that financial institutions should consider both current and future climate risks, including policy changes like FEMA's Risk Rating 2.0 and increased wildfire risks. ICE also discusses the use of scenario analysis tools, such as the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathways, to understand climate risks. They recommend that the FDIC require institutions to validate assumptions in their risk models. ICE advises caution in applying climate risks to other risk categories, noting challenges in incorporating climate events into liquidity models. They conclude by offering to discuss their recommendations further with the FDIC."

291,kzn-crue-y39j,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously, they are providing hundreds of billions of dollars in financing annually into fossil fuel companies. Banks' continued financing for fossil fuels is driving climate change – a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. Regulators must finally put an end to financial institutions gambling with our future. While it is notable that the OCC is beginning to assess the risks that climate change is posing for our economy, it is of paramount importance that you also compel banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address and mitigate the harms their funding decisions are causing to our environment and communities. While I support a number of issues that were proposed in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) guidance’s recommendations to banks, I believe that the OCC should instead conduct a rulemaking that compels these actions: • incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; • plan for climate change over a long-time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; • develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; and • make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments. However, it is my opinion that rather than put forward mere guidance, the OCC should instead issue mandatory obligations on regulated banking institutions so that they must assess, disclose, and mitigate the potential risks that their funding decisions could pose for climate change. Indeed, these obligations are in conjunction with federal environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as the OCC’s duty to supervise financial institutions so that they operate in a safe and sound manner. The OCC must also ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to align with the international community’s commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 ºC. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions, including through an immediate end of financing for the fossil fuel industry’s expansion, as well as a phase-out of remaining fossil fuel financing in line with a 1.5 ºC global warming limit. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    My name is Randy Whitehead, President and CEO of PeoplesTrust Bank in HamiIton, Alabama. I am  writing to provide comments regarding the FDIC's statement of principles for climate-related financial  risk management for large financial institutions. I suspect that should these proposed requirements be  placed upon larger institutions it will only be a matter of time before smaller institutions will have  similar requirements.  I submit to you that the risk of ever-increasing regulation and the related  expense, creates a much greater risk to rural community banks than does climate change risk. As you  know the tremendous expense involved in complying with this regulation would be a huge burden on  small community banks. The banks which are the financial lifeblood of rural towns and communities are  either being consolidated into larger institutions or are closing branches in small towns partially due to  the ever-increasing cost of regulation, leaving the people of these communities with the only option of  driving many miles to participate in the banking system.  Our small City of Hamilton, Alabama has a  branch of a major nationwide banking institution. While that institution is pleased to operate here and  offer a myriad of checking accounts which provide that institution with low-cost deposits to be utilized  around the country, local individuals and small businesses find it difficult to obtain loans at that  institution. My point, obviously, is that without small, local community banks, people in rural  communities are going to be greatly harmed and unable to participate in the financial system.  Climate  change is ultimately ""weather"" which fluctuates and cycles over time within a fairly narrow range. As  high school students in the 1970's we observed that the climate scientists of the time were predicting  that the earth was entering into the next ""ice age"". How wise would it have been to commit millions and  billions of dollars over the course of the past 50 years preparing for the risk associated with another ice  age?  We operate a branch in Hackleburg, Alabama, a small town that was almost totally destroyed in  the tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011. We were able to work with our customers in the aftermath of  that disaster and in the years since the tornado the town has become better and stronger. Having  witnessed the devastation personally, I can attest that no amount of risk management would have  reduced the damage done by the F-5 tornado that day. In addition, many of our customers, operated  heavy equipment (fueled by diesel and gasoline) to clear the debris from the destruction and help  residents get on with their lives.  While I am pleased that this proposal is currently limited to banks of  $100 billion or more in total assets, I also know that many times, limited application regulations are  ultimately applied to all banking institutions. I respectfully request that the FDIC refrain from  implementing climate related risk management requirements that will ultimately do serious financial  damage to the residents of the rural communities we serve.

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC  20429    Re: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) Request for Comment on  ""Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions” (RIN 3064–ZA32)    Dear Mr. Sheesley:  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (“the Chamber”) appreciates the opportunity to  share our views in response to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC” or  “agency”) request for feedback on “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related  Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions” (“principles” or  “proposal”).     The Chamber has been a leader in the conversation on environmental, social,  and governance (“ESG”) topics for nearly a decade, and we continue to actively  collaborate with our members and other stakeholders to promote practices, policies,  and technology innovations across industry and government that address our shared  climate challenges, particularly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the lowest  levels possible at the pace of innovation.      Having been engaged on ESG topics across all industries, the Chamber is also a  ready participant in conversations about the impacts of climate change on our  financial system. While the Chamber is supportive of the overall goals of the FDIC as  we move toward a low carbon economy, we also support the development of market- driven solutions to these problems. As we noted in a 2020 report, “the fundamental  challenge we face today is to preserve the ability of American companies to grow,  innovate, and drive prosperity under a system of free and fair capitalism. The  Chamber—through its Project Growth and Opportunity or “Project GO”—is committed 
to identifying practical, sustainable ways to address socio-economic challenges.”1 As a  part of this effort, the Chamber, in 2019, released principles for ESG reporting that are  both material and industry specific.2    These FDIC principles follow the actions of other regulators who are also  prioritizing the development and implementation of a standardized reporting regime  for climate risks. Earlier in 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)  released a request for feedback that is substantively similar to the FDIC request.  Around the same time, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) accepted  comments on a proposal it issued on climate-related financial risk for banks. As noted  in this request, the FDIC plans to issue forthcoming guidance on climate risk “that  would distinguish roles and responsibilities of boards of directors (boards) and  management, incorporate the feedback received on the principles, and consider  lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions.” We  applaud the FDIC for its stated intention to incorporate feedback from stakeholders  and urge you in any future guidance to collaborate with other regulators at home and  abroad who are taking these similar steps on climate risk.     It is also critical to point out that in any forthcoming guidance on climate- related financial risk, the FDIC should not recommend moving capital away from  industries or sectors that may have more environmental risk. As the federal agency  standing behind consumers’ deposits and tasked with resolving failed institutions, the  FDIC has a keen interest in the safety and soundness of insured depository  institutions. Directing capital away from politically disfavored industries can be  dangerous for our entire economy. Indeed, such an approach would lead to wide  swings in regulation as political Administrations change, undermining confidence in  our banking system. We encourage the FDIC to limit its focus on supporting financial  institutions in their assessments of climate risks only for safety and soundness  purposes.   Responses to FDIC Principles and Questions  In the comments below, the Chamber addresses certain aspects of climate- related financial risk management for banks and answers specific questions posed in  the guidance.    1 Restarting the Growth Engine: A Plan to Reform America’s Capital Markets, U.S. Chamber of  Commerce Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (November 2020). ccmc_growthengine_final.pdf  (uschamber.com)  2 ESG Reporting Best Practices, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Project GO (2019).  https://www.projectgo.com/esg-reporting-best-practices/ 
Governance  The need to understand the exposure and impact of climate-related financial  risk is important, but the outline of governance in the principles is short on specific  requirements and instead gives a high-level review of expectations for bank  management. While the request mentions that a bank’s board and management  should demonstrate “appropriate understanding of climate-related financial risk  exposures,” it seems to be left to the FDIC’s discretion to determine what is  appropriate. The proposal also mentions that the board’s understanding and  knowledge to assess the potential impact of climate-related risks on an institution  should be “adequate” but gives no detail as to what constitutes adequate knowledge.  As we have mentioned, the Chamber supports market-driven solutions, and many  public companies—including banks—are already demonstrating a significant  understanding of these risks.3 Institutions are also integrating climate-related policies  and responsibilities throughout their organizations. Further guidance from the FDIC  should take into account these efforts and the deep understanding of climate risks  that banks already possess.    Strategic Planning  The Chamber commends the FDIC for recognizing that strategic planning for  climate-related financial risk is an iterative process, and the proposal notes that  climate risks evolve and mature over time. The proposal also notes that “any climate- related strategies, including any relevant corporate social responsibility objectives,  should align with and support the bank’s broader strategy, risk appetite, and risk  management framework.” Climate-related risk is one of a host of risks, and banks  must institute different strategies to prepare for each type of risk in any strategic  planning.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has even noted that there is a  limited amount of research and accompanying data that explore how climate risk  drivers feed into transmission channels and the financial risks faced by banks.”4  Undue emphasis on climate-related risk in strategic planning could lead banks to  spend inordinate time and resources on climate risks when others are more material.  We urge that in any forthcoming guidance, the FDIC not place an undue emphasis on  climate-related risks over others in a bank’s overall risk strategy.      3 See for example the Chamber’s report on materiality of corporate disclosures. Essential Information:  Modernizing Our Corporate Disclosure System. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Center for Capital Markets  Competitiveness (2017). https://www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com/resource/essential-information- modernizing-our-corporate-disclosure-system/   4 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission  channels (April 2021), https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf.  
Management of Risk Areas   Managing climate risks presents an added layer of difficulty for banks  since these risks must be incorporated into a bank’s overall risk profile.  Research by Federal Reserve staff recognizes these challenges:  In principle, quantifying climate-related risks should be  similar to quantifying other financial stability risks. In  practice,  however, climate-related  risks  face  several  challenges to measurement beyond those associated with  conventional financial system vulnerabilities and potential  shocks, and which will require investment to address. These  climate-related features impair not only estimation and  modeling at the level of the overall economy, but also the  analysis of region-, sector-, asset-, institution-, and investor- level exposures. Investment in data procurement, and careful  analysis of climate-related data to describe specific  economic and financial risks, is critical to addressing these  challenges and producing high-quality research on climate- related outcomes.5  The proposal also makes numerous references to physical risks of climate  change like damage to property and business disruptions and notes that financial  institutions are likely to be affected by these risks. However, the proposal fails to note  that those risks are often negligible and very short-lived. A staff report by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York concluded that:   FEMA disasters over the last quarter century had insignificant  or small effects on U.S. banks’ performance. This stability  seems endogenous rather than a mere reflection of federal aid.  Disasters increase loan demand, which offsets losses and  actually boosts profits at larger banks. Local banks tend to  avoid mortgage lending where floods are more common than  official flood maps would predict, suggesting that local  knowledge may also mitigate disaster impacts.6     5 Board of Governors of the Federal System, Climate Change and Financial Stability,   https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/climate-change-and-financial-stability- 20210319.htm   6 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks? (November 2021),   https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr990.pdf  
  In any future guidance, the FDIC should consider the challenge banks  face in managing climate risk while recognizing that many banks are already  doing significant work to mitigate the effects of climate-related disasters.  The proposal notes specific risk areas that bank should account for in  their risk management plans:  A. Credit Risk  Credit risk is an important aspect of a bank’s overall risk profile. In the context of  climate-related events, staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noted that  climate disasters have not proven to be a significant source of risk for banks:  Our findings suggest the disaster channel is not likely a  material source of instability for banks. Even very small banks  facing extreme disasters are not substantially threatened. This  resilience seems inherent to some degree because disasters  increase the demand for loans. Earnings on new loans helps  offset losses on loans on the books. In fact, income for larger  banks increases after disasters. Local banks also manage to  limit exposure to high-risk areas, perhaps reflecting their  greater knowledge of such risks. Those endogenous factors  seem to buttress banks more than federal disaster assistance.7  The FDIC should consider these findings in any future guidance related to credit  risk, in addition to recognizing that relying on credit risk models presents its own set  of challenges: “the estimation of credit risk models needed to generate loss  projections relies on a limited set of datapoints and has no near-term potential for  back-testing. Furthermore, because the loss projections rely so heavily on the  judgment of experts, validating the projections is nearly impossible.”8  B.  Liquidity Risk  The guidance directs banks to “assess whether climate-related financial risks  could affect liquidity buffers and, if so, incorporate those risks into their liquidity risk  management and liquidity buffers.” Banks already incorporate these risks into their  risk management profile. With already stringent liquidity requirements in place for  banks, the Chamber cautions the FDIC against issuing any guidance that would  unnecessarily burden banks with increased liquidity requirements, thus impairing    7 Federal Reserve Bank of New York at  https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr990.pdf   8 Bank Policy Institute (BPI), Challenges in Stress Testing and Climate Change (October 2020),   https://bpi.com/challenges-in-stress-testing-and-climate-change/   
banks’ ability to meet customer needs. As noted above, banks consider all forms of  risk, and climate-related risk is only one of a host of risks they must weigh.    C.  Legal/Compliance Risk  As with any new regulations, legal and compliance risks will increase for banks  as they are required to incorporate climate risk into their overall risk profile. This will  be particularly acute for banks that have instituted a massive increase in legal and  compliance staff in the wake of the regulatory barrage following the implementation of  the Dodd-Frank Act. In any forthcoming guidance, the FDIC should weigh the  implications of future regulatory actions on banks’ compliance efforts, as such  compliance costs are regressive to the size of an institution. This is important to note  as mid-size banks are important providers of financing for main street businesses.    The guidelines also note that any consideration of risks by banks should  include “possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures  disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as  race or ethnicity.” The Chamber notes that banks are acutely aware of the potential  impacts of their risk mitigation efforts and are committed to instituting risk measures  that do not disproportionately affect any particular communities, including their  obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and applicable fair lending  laws.     Below, we address specific questions posed in the FDIC principles:  Question 1: Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location,  business model) to which these principles should apply?   The Chamber does not feel that these principles should apply to other  categories of banks. The choice of a $100 billion threshold already encapsulates a  significant number of banks and will encompass more as banks grow organically and  as the industry continues to consolidate. In any event, the Chamber urges  coordination with other bank regulators to ensure that these principles are applied  fairly.    Question 2: How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related  financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile,  and scope of operations?   The Chamber applauds the FDIC for its intention to maintain a risk-based  approach to supervision and to tailor future guidance based on banks’ complexity of 
operations and business models. In future guidance, the FDIC should recognize that  banks have differing risk profiles and needs based on their size and structure. We  believe that appropriate tailoring should be included in any future guidance for banks  related to climate risk based on size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations.  Question 3: What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their  risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with banks to  understand those challenges?  Compliance issues are always among the biggest challenges in implementing  new policies and procedures at any financial institution. Even when banks undertake  these changes voluntarily, which many are doing, the transition costs and burdens are  significant. As the FDIC plans to issue future guidance on climate risk, banks would  likely welcome engagement with the agency. This request for feedback, along with  other public interaction with banks, will provide the FDIC opportunities to better  understand the challenges banks face in incorporating climate risk into their risk  management systems.    Question 5: How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material  and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?               Banks and other financial institutions are making investments in more climate- smart, modern, resilient infrastructure to reduce overall risks over the asset life cycle.  Companies that have operations or products dependent on natural resources or are  geographically at risk to climate impacts are often highlighting material implications in  disclosures.   From a climate risk perspective, banks take into consideration the plausibility  and certainty of a risk to determine materiality. Risks that meet these criteria will  warrant greater attention by boards and management. If a bank determines that risks  are speculative and distant, they generally will not consider them material or give them  heightened scrutiny. Banks should be given the flexibility to determine what is  material, and in future guidance, the FDIC should recognize that these determinations  are evolving due to the immaturity of data.    Question 9: How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial  risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities,  specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities?  Banks are acutely aware that their risk mitigation strategies could impact  communities and are focusing on building resilience as part of investments. A major 
strategic focus of banks is compliance with CRA. Under CRA, banks are required to  consider the impact of their business decisions on low-to-moderate income (LMI) and  other disadvantaged communities. Allowing banks to receive CRA credit for climate  risk mitigation activity in LMI communities would be an attractive way to promote  responsible climate policies and transition to cleaner investments while also  furthering the investment goals of the CRA.  Question 10: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models  from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor,  and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain  this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data,  metrics, tools, or models?  Regarding data, the Chamber commends the FDIC for its acknowledgment that  “data, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at  a rapid pace.” A major point of concern for Chamber members is the fact that, while  data is foundational, it is currently very immature. Since collection of climate data is in  its early stages, banks are still trying to determine what data needs to be collected  and do not have a complete understanding of what is useful. Data will improve over  time, but the Chamber requests that the FDIC explicitly appreciate that current data  collection practices are not at their end state. Banks have a strong desire to comply  with supervisory expectations and requirements, but there is a need for phasing or an  iterative process in the early stages as each bank determines what is useful. Long lead  times should be permitted, and the Chamber asks that regulators provide banks  latitude in any forthcoming guidance regarding data collection.   Another major concern banks have regarding data, disclosures, and reporting is  the audience for the data. Banks would want to know if the information they provide  will be private and only for regulators’ use, or if it will be made public.   The FDIC should also make use of any data that is collected and reported to  international bodies. Coordination by these agencies is key to reducing burdens on  banks to provide redundant information. This will streamline requirements for banks  and help avoid duplicative, time-consuming efforts to comply with the demands of  multiple regulators.    Question 12: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management  that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks  use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face?  Banks engage in “scenario analysis,” but banks define the term in a variety of  ways, and this request does not attempt to bring clarity by defining the term. In any 
forthcoming guidance, the Chamber requests that the FDIC clarify what is meant by  “scenario analysis,” as it is an ambiguous term that could encompass many different  types of planning. Additionally, the Chamber asks the FDIC to clarify who will be  responsible for conducting scenario analysis: will the FDIC be conducting the analysis,  or will the responsibility fall to banks or third parties?   The Chamber does not believe that scenario analysis should be tied to capital  or liquidity requirements. Scenario analysis should only be used to help understand  potential risks to a bank’s balance sheet and inform its overall risk management  strategy.  It is important to note that the SEC is also exploring scenario analysis  requirements. The SEC Chair has made reference to requiring “scenario analysis” on  how a business might adapt to the range of possible physical, legal, market, and  economic changes that the company could contend with in the future related to  climate. As with all other aspects of this guidance, in any attempts by the FDIC to  implement scenario analysis, the FDIC should coordinate with regulators who are  pursuing similar goals to avoid duplicative regulatory requirements for banks.    Question 13: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing  and executing scenario analysis exercises?  It is important to recognize the distinction between traditional stress testing  exercises and climate scenario analysis:  Stress testing for climate change is starkly different from  existing macro stress testing and given data and methodology  challenges likely to be less reliable.  First, the lack of historical  data creates important challenges in modeling the interactions  between climate, the macroeconomy, and the financial sector,  which are necessary requirements in designing plausible and  coherent scenarios. Second, climate stress testing attempts to  measure outcomes over a much longer time horizon—30 to 50  years rather than nine quarters for macroeconomic stress  testing. Third, models that generally relate credit losses to  climate risk scenarios require large amounts of information  about future counterparty behavior over a long time horizon.  Fourth, climate stress tests generally assume that banks take  no actions to hedge or reduce exposures to climate risks over  that horizon.  While macroeconomic stress testing has a similar  assumption regarding hedging, and therefore may produce 
some error over a nine-quarter horizon, this assumption,  however, becomes deeply counterfactual over a period of  decades.”9  The proposal also recognizes this difference, and we encourage the FDIC to  continue to account for this difference in any forthcoming proposals. Additionally, for  any future design or execution of scenario analysis, the FDIC should follow the  appropriate notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act  (“APA”). New policies related to climate-related financial risk should be made only  after weighing the costs and benefits of the chosen course, with justification for new  policies being made clear to affected parties and the public. Public notice and  comment are a vital component of rulemaking and should guide all regulatory efforts.  Clear communication with banks is important, and banks should have fair and  advanced notice of their disclosure and compliance obligations. We encourage the  FDIC to provide fair notice, expressly communicate its expectations, and adhere to the  APA.  Conclusion  As the FDIC reviews the current landscape of climate-related risk for banks,  and considers possible new guidance, it must recognize the remarkable progress that  has already been achieved through market-based approaches and practices and  increased communication between banks and their customers. The business  community has made building climate-smart, modern, resilient infrastructure among  our top priorities.  Any proposals related to climate risk for banks should afford banks  the flexibility to adequately adopt disclosures that are appropriate, considering a  bank’s particular business, operations, and financial performance.

EDF, Policy Integrity, and ICRRL support the Draft Principles as an important step in the OCC’s efforts to guide banks to update their risk management practices as needed in light of climate- related financial risks, thereby promoting safety and soundness. We recommend that the OCC continue building upon these Draft Principles with more detailed guidance, as it has indicated it plans to do, moving expeditiously and in coordination with other regulators working to address climate-related financial risk. We offer the following recommendations to help inform that process:4 I. The OCC should consider offering more detailed guidance regarding the physical and transition risks that affect the management of various risk areas. (Draft Principles, Page 4–5) II. The OCC should consider guiding banks on the use of relevant, accurate, and timely climate-related data for risk management and reporting. (Draft Principles, Page 3) III. The OCC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into regulatory reports and can leverage other entities’ work on climate-related disclosures. (Draft Principles, Question #11) IV. In designing and executing scenario analyses, OCC should consider defining orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot-house scenarios, setting at least a thirty-year analysis period, and accounting for the correlated nature of risks. (Draft Principles, Question #13) V. The OCC should consider how to mitigate potential harm to disadvantaged communities from banks’ climate risk management strategies. (Draft Principles, Page 1) I. The OCC should consider offering more detailed guidance regarding the physical and transition risks that affect the management of various risk areas. (Draft Principles, Page 4–5) Although the Draft Principles provide an outline of how banks should approach managing climate risk within their portfolios, they could be buttressed with additional insight into what types of risks may manifest themselves.5 The OCC notes that it “will elaborate on these risk assessment principles in subsequent guidance.”6 We support the OCC’s intent to issue additional guidance (including the specified elements), recommend that the OCC make this further guidance publicly available, and provide a non-exhaustive list of additional considerations it should include. In addition, we encourage the OCC to more clearly highlight climate-related market risk, discuss the interconnectedness of these risk areas, and include private governance initiatives as an area of non-financial risk. 4 In parentheses beside each heading, we note the question(s) from or pages of the Draft Principles to which the section is most relevant. 5 Draft Principles, supra note 2, at 4–5. 6 Id. at 4. Specifically, the OCC intends to put forth subsequent guidance regarding these principles that will “distinguish roles and responsibilities of boards of directors (boards) and management, incorporate the feedback received on the principles, and consider lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions.” Id. at 2. 2
Climate-related financial risk is generally divided into two broad categories: physical risks and transition risks.7 Physical risks include the damages wrought by wildfires, flooding, extreme heat, and other direct results of climate change.8 Transition risks are the costs associated with societal shifts in response to climate change, such as those from technological and policy changes, changing consumer sentiment, and liability for climate damages.9 Typical bank portfolios exhibit both physical and transition risks. The OCC identifies the following risk management areas in its Draft Principles: credit risk, liquidity risk, other financial risk (including price and interest rate risks), operational risk, legal/compliance risk, and other non-financial risk (including reputational, liability, and litigation risks).10 Additional guidance explicitly outlining the types of climate-related risks relevant to each risk management area would set clearer expectations for the scope of banks’ risk assessments and make it more likely that banks acquire the tools necessary to assess the climate risks in their portfolios.11 While climate risks are similar to other types of financial risks, it is also the case that “the nature of climate risks is less familiar to financial institutions.”12 Financial institutions are still building the expertise needed to identify potential climate risks and providing more tailored guidance will ensure that banks are on the right track. A. The OCC should consider clarifying how climate-related credit risk implicates both an obligor’s ability to pay a loan, as well as risk to the underlying collateral. The OCC should consider providing examples of the types of credit risk that banks should review in risk assessments. In particular, the OCC could demonstrate ways climate change could either reduce an obligor’s ability to pay or cause damage to the underlying collateral, increasing a bank’s losses in the case of default. Currently, the Draft Principles focus most closely on the risks associated with credit concentration within a particular market or region.13 While these risks are important and bear discussion, other portfolio risks could also be made clear. The OCC’s Large Bank Supervision Handbook defines credit risk as, “the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract with the bank or otherwise perform as agreed.”14 The magnitude of this risk is 7 See, e.g., Madison Condon et al., Mandating Disclosure of Climate-Related Financial Risk, 23 N.Y.U.

defined both by the likelihood that the obligor will pay their debt and the value the bank can recover if the obligor fails to do so. In other words, credit risk responds both to the creditworthiness of the obligor and to changes in the value of the underlying collateral. Climate risk is present in both considerations. There are myriad reasons why climate-related risks could decrease the probability of debt repayment. For example, as the world transitions to a low- or zero-carbon economy, a fossil- fuel company may abandon certain projects—a transition risk. Similarly, new environmental regulations—such as the regulation of methane emissions—could make fossil fuels less profitable. Physical risks could mean that a company dependent on physical outdoor labor could have diminished productivity with increasing incidences of extreme heat. An agricultural company might face reduced crop yields. Banks should weigh these risks when assessing the creditworthiness of a debtor. Additionally, a failure to contemplate physical and transition risks may mean that the collateral underlying a loan is overvalued. Consider, for example, a home in California in a wildfire-prone area. If the home burns down—a physical risk—the value of the collateral is severely reduced. Even absent a fire, the looming specter of this risk could cause a home to lose value if, for example, insurers are no longer willing to cover the risk of wildfires or if consumers have concerns about living in wildfire-prone areas.15 In assessing a bank’s safety and soundness, the OCC already considers a bank’s underwriting practices with regards to the sufficiency of collateral and creditworthiness of obligors.16 The climate’s impact on credit risk is an aspect of these traditional concerns. By providing illustrative examples of credit risks, the OCC can ensure these risks receive sufficient due diligence. B. The OCC should consider providing more detail on the types of climate-related liquidity risks a bank may face. While the OCC properly includes liquidity risk as a category to be considered in risk assessments, additional detail would be useful. The OCC should consider clearly laying out examples of climate-related liquidity risks and also describe how liquidity risks may 15 See Jay Feinman, What Is a Protection Gap?

exacerbate—or be exacerbated by—operational and market risk.17 Liquidity risks may materialize when there is reduced buyer interest in particular assets. For example, societal movement away from fossil fuels could result in stranded assets, posing liquidity issues for banks invested in these assets.18 C. The OCC should consider providing additional detail on market risk and suggesting acceptable measurement methods for such risk. The Draft Principles section on “Other Financial Risk” discusses interest and price risk— components of market risk.19 The OCC notes that there are challenges with existing methodologies to estimate these risks and therefore advises banks to “use the best measurement methodologies reasonably available to them.”20 The OCC should consider treating market risk more explicitly within the Draft Principles and suggesting an array of acceptable measurement methodologies. Market risk—the risk that an institution’s investments lose value—is a significant avenue for climate-related financial risk. Physical risks, for example, can threaten commodities, such as agricultural products, which could affect future values.21 Transition risks can also affect investment value. For example, policy or technology changes that align the U.S. energy system with a carbon-zero future could lead to declines in the oil market;22 given the global nature of the oil market, policy or technology changes in other parts of the world could lower demand for oil as well.23 These risks could be explicitly noted. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) anticipated regulations on climate-related disclosures should assist banks in considering climate impacts as they make certain types of investments.24 In turn, this should make it easier to conduct thorough risk assessments regarding market risk. However, many tradeable assets may not be subject to the SEC’s 17 Nahiomy Alvarez et al., A New Framework for Assessing Climate Change Risk in Financial Markets, 448 CHICAGO FED. LETTER (Nov. 2020), https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2020/448 (noting that “typically, climate change risk is unlikely to make an asset less liquid without making the asset lose value, making a borrower insolvent, or disrupting financial infrastructure”). 18 See Drew Riedl, Why Market Actors Fuel the Carbon Bubble: The Agency, Governance, and Incentive Problems that Distort Corporate Climate Risk Management, J.

regulation. Municipal bonds, for example, are not subject to SEC reporting requirements.25 The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has requested that the Municipal Securities Regulation Board (“MSRB”) examine how best to estimate climate-related risk; the OCC should remain abreast of this work.26 These market considerations are within the ambit of risks that banks should already be considering. Bank supervisors already assess a bank’s “price sensitivity to various market factors (e.g. . . . commodity prices) [and] . . . sensitivity of assets, derivatives, and mortgage servicing rights to valuation inputs (interest rates, prepayments, and volatilities).”27 The Draft Principles nevertheless serve as a critical reminder that the climate crisis will likely affect these prices in a tangible way and that these climate risks must be contemplated. Adding more detail could help ensure these risks are properly considered. D. The OCC should consider describing third-party operational risk in more detail. The Draft Principles provide some detail on how climate change could exacerbate operational risks. Additional concrete examples, demonstrating the range of risks, could be helpful, particularly regarding third-party risk. Even if a bank’s operation centers do not themselves face climate risk, if they depend on at-risk infrastructure—such as sanitation and power grids—the risk inherent in that infrastructure propagates to the business operations. While Hurricane Sandy caused evacuation orders that directly shuttered many Wall Street banks, in February 2021, it was failures in the Texas electricity grid that forced banks to close branches.28 In our interdependent world, it is not sufficient to consider only the risk associated with a particular parcel of land; banks must also consider how third-party risk enters the system. While the Draft Principles mention “third-party operations” as a source of risk,29 making these connections more explicit will encourage banks to create more robust plans. E. The OCC should consider more explicitly describing how legal and compliance risk interplay with other forms of risk. While the Draft Principles currently discuss legal and compliance risk, the OCC should consider expanding the discussion to describe the interconnectedness between legal risk and other 25 FSOC Climate Report, supra note 12, at 87; see also Parker Bolstad et al., Flying Blind: What Do Investors Really Know About Climate Change Risks in the U.S. Equity and Municipal Debt Markets? 4–5 (Hutchins Ctr.

types of risk. For example, the OCC flags “changes to legal requirements for . . . flood or disaster-related insurance” as an area of potential legal or compliance risk.30 While changes to these legal requirements would pose a compliance risk for a bank, it is also the case that changes in insurance requirements could pose a credit risk, particularly given that property and casualty insurance terms are often only a few years long—shorter than many loan terms.31 F. The OCC should consider including private governance initiatives as a sub-category when discussing other non-financial risk. The OCC notes that banks should consider other non-financial risks, such as reputational damage, liability, and litigation. In addition to these risks, OCC should also consider explicitly mentioning the potential for private governance initiatives,32 including investor pressure. Member banks of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance have committed to align their assets and liabilities with a pathway to a net-zero carbon emission earth by 2050.33 It is possible that banks that have not made such commitments will face investor pressure to do so and, on the other hand, that banks that have committed will be held to those commitments by shareholders. In either case, banks should be aware of their position within the net-zero commitment landscape. II. The OCC should consider guiding banks on the use of relevant, accurate, and timely climate-related data for risk management and reporting. (Draft Principles, Page 3) As the OCC recognizes in its Draft Principles, “[s]ound climate risk management depends on the availability of relevant, accurate, and timely data.”34 The OCC should consider guiding banks on best practices regarding sources and analytical methods for climate risk data. Banks should use data both from counterparties and from public sources to develop a comprehensive picture of their climate-related risk exposure. With transactional counterparties, banks should solicit information regarding risks to the particular assets or activities involved in the transaction, as well as risks to the counterparty’s creditworthiness generally.35 The OCC could also guide banks on reliable sources and proper uses of various 30 Id. 31 See Antonio Grimaldi et al., Climate Change and P&C Insurance: The Threat and the Opportunity, MCKINSEY & CO.

types of publicly available data, such as climate-related disclosures, climate projections, and climate-related financial risks. Data should be incorporated as relevant into identification, measurement, management, and disclosure of climate risks. To efficiently develop rigorous and consistent climate data practices, the OCC should consider ways to coordinate with other regulators working to address climate risks, as well as other experts and stakeholders. The OCC’s membership in FSOC, which has commenced work on climate risk issues including data,36 as well as in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), provide important opportunities for coordination among U.S. financial regulators generally and banking regulators specifically. Given the global nature of both the financial system and climate risks, continued participation by the OCC in the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”)37 and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”)38 will also be important. Finally, the OCC can benefit from communication with other agencies with expertise in climate-related data, like the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, including through structures like interagency working groups. III. The OCC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into regulatory reports and can leverage other entities’ work on climate-related disclosures. (Draft Principles, Question #11) The OCC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into the disclosures made in their quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (“call reports”) and any other regulatory reports where such information is relevant. Requiring public disclosures by regulated entities of climate-related financial risks can spur better risk identification and management practices by those entities, as well as provide benefits for regulators, investors, the market, and the general public. In designing these requirements, the OCC can leverage existing and forthcoming work by other regulators, entities, and experts on disclosure of climate-related financial risk. Call reports are a core source of data for safety and soundness supervision, and the OCC should consider how these reports can be updated to reflect climate-related financial risks to banks. As the OCC states in the Regulatory Reporting section of its Comptroller’s Handbook, “[t]he call report data provide detailed financial information on the bank’s assets, liabilities, capital, 36 FSOC Climate Report, supra note 12, at 47–66. 37 See NGFS Publications, NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FIN.

income, and expenses, as of the report date and for the period covered.”39 The FFIEC provides instructions on preparation of call reports.40 Updating these instructions with details on where and how to incorporate climate risk into a call report will benefit both the reporting entities and the users of reported information.41 Standardizing disclosures helps to ensure that they are comparable, specific, and decision-useful.42 Disclosing climate risk information publicly, such as through call reports,43 benefits multiple stakeholders.44 As explained by FSOC, “[r]egulatory reports assist the federal banking agencies in fulfilling their supervisory mandates, and assist the public, state banking authorities, researchers, and bank rating agencies in understanding the condition of the banking sector.”45 Mandating disclosures would benefit banks by compelling them “to engage in careful and systematic analyses of their exposures to climate risk, preventing them from ignoring worst- case scenarios or unfavorable information,” while also addressing the collective action problems and mismatched incentives that dissuade voluntary disclosures.46 Access to improved climate risk information benefits investors, who can better align their investment decisions with their objectives, which in turn helps the market avoid the destabilizing effects of a burst “climate bubble.”47 Given the role climate-related disclosures can play in preventing economic crises and internalizing externalities, the greater public also benefits.48 Many other entities, including other regulators, NGOs, and IGOs, have undertaken efforts on developing climate-related disclosures that the OCC can leverage to the extent that they are relevant in this context.

climate risk disclosure resources developed by FSOC, NGFS,49 and BCBS.50 The BCBS climate risk principles include guidelines specifically for examiners as well as for banks, an approach that OCC should consider for its subsequent guidance.51 Among U.S. federal regulators, the SEC has made the most progress to date, with a proposed rule mandating climate-related disclosures expected in early 2022. In addition to looking to the SEC’s ultimate approach, the OCC can analyze the voluminous materials on climate disclosures that various experts submitted in response to the SEC’s March 2021 request for public input.52 Many of those submissions highlighted the work of voluntary disclosure regimes like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures53 and the industry-specific Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards (including for financial institutions),54 which could likewise be a useful resource for the OCC. Banking regulators in other jurisdictions both internationally, like the European Central Bank (“ECB”),55 and sub-nationally in the United States, like the New York Department of Financial Services,56 have also taken substantial steps on disclosure of climate risk by regulated entities. The OCC may also consider consulting with other types of state regulators that administer reporting or disclosure requirements relevant to certain climate-related physical or transition risks, including greenhouse gas emissions. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, for example, could provide valuable information on methane disclosure from the oil and gas sector. Furthermore, convening structures for banking industry participants like the Climate Financial Risk Forum57 and the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative58 have produced multiple reports and guides reflecting the industry’s views on best climate risk practices. 49 See NGFS Publications, NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FIN.

IV. In designing and executing scenario analyses, OCC should consider defining orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot-house scenarios, setting at least a thirty-year analysis period, and accounting for the correlated nature of risks. (Draft Principles, Question #13) A number of other jurisdictions have begun conducting either scenario analyses or stress tests over the past few years. These jurisdictions include the ECB,59 the Bank of England,60 the Bank of Canada, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,61 among many others.62 The OCC should take notice of the scenarios used by these jurisdictions and their comparative advantages, as well as the sample scenarios prepared by NGFS.63 Here, we flag three best practices of particular interest: in designing and executing scenario analyses, the OCC should consider defining scenarios that include an orderly and disorderly transition, as well as a hot-house scenario, setting at least a thirty-year analysis window, and accounting for the correlated nature of risks. A. The OCC should consider designing orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot- house scenarios in order to ensure that banks are exercising safe and sound practices with regards to each of these possible these outcomes. The OCC should consider designing scenarios reflecting an orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot-house world, in order to ensure that banks are meeting safety and soundness assessments under each of these possible future scenarios. Much is still uncertain about the extent to which the world will rise to the challenge of climate change. The scientific community, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “has collectively chosen four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs),” reflecting a range of possible trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting climate impacts, “to help [standardize] and improve comparability of climate change analysis.”64 Financial sector experts 59 Spyros Alogoskoufis et al., ECB Economy-Wide Climate Stress Test, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (Working Paper No. 281, Sept. 2021), https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op281~05a7735b1c.en.pdf. 60 GUIDANCE FOR PARTICIPANTS OF THE 2021 BIENNIAL EXPLORATORY SCENARIO: FINANCIAL RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE, BANK OF ENGLAND (2021), https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/stress-testing/2021/the-2021-biennial- exploratory-scenario-on-the-financial-risks-from-climate-change.pdf. 61 HONG KONG MONETARY AUTHORITY, PILOT BANKING SECTOR CLIMATE RISK STRESS TEST (2021), https://www.hkma.gov.hk /media/eng/doc/key-functions/banking-stability/Pilot_banking_sector_ climate_risk_stress_test.pdf. 62 See NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FIN.

then analyze the economic implications of these different emissions pathways, taking into account the accompanying societal action. The best-case scenario is an “orderly transition,” meaning stakeholders reduce emissions at a consistent rate, stemming warming around 1.5 to 2°C, as compared to pre-industrial levels.65 This approach would blunt the worst of physical risks, while imposing some transition costs. On the other hand, it is possible that no climate action—beyond current policies—is taken. In this case, warming peaks at a much higher level leading to a “hot-house” scenario.66 Under a hot-house scenario, early transition costs are limited because the economy does not decarbonize; however, physical risks are much more severe than under an orderly transition.67 A third possibility is between the two: a “disorderly transition.”68 In this scenario, emissions continue at the level of current policy commitments for another decade or so, at which point severe physical harms spur action to limit warming to 1.5 to 2°C, leading to increased transition costs as the world strives to reduce emissions on a shortened timeline. This third scenario, therefore, carries both high initial physical costs and high and abrupt transition costs, though ultimately lower physical risks than the hot-house scenario. Depending on which scenario occurs, the nature, timing, and scale of physical and transition costs vary. In order to understand whether banks will continue to meet safety and soundness requirements, it is necessary to understand how banks’ portfolios would be affected under these different possible pathways. Among other jurisdictions that have conducted scenario analysis, the three scenarios described above are a consistent fixture, with the primary variation being whether the orderly and disorderly transition cap warming at 1.5 or 2.0°C.69 B. The OCC should consider at least a thirty year time horizon and would likely benefit from also considering longer horizons. In determining the time horizon of the scenario analysis, the OCC should consider at least a thirty year time horizon and would likely benefit from considering longer time periods as well, capacity permitting. NGFS notes the tradeoffs in setting a time window for scenario analysis. While a shorter scenario window period reduces uncertainty in the estimate and may be more immediately actionable, a longer window gives more thorough insight into climate-related risks that are likely to affect the financial institution’s balance sheet, long-term, particularly as assets can be long-lived.70 65 Id. at 18. 66 Id. See also NGFS Climate Scenarios, supra note 63, at 9 (estimating warming between 2.5 and 3.0°C in a hot- house scenario). 67 NGFS Guide to Climate Scenario Analysis, supra note 64, at 18. 68 Id. 69 Alogoskoufis et al., supra note 59, at 16–17; HONG KONG MONETARY AUTHORITY, supra note 61, at 2; BANK OF ENGLAND, supra note 60, at 56; but see BANK OF CANADA, USING SCENARIO ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CLIMATE TRANSITION RISK (2022), https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BoC-OSFI-Using-Scenario-Analysis-to-Assess- Climate-Transition-Risk.pdf (using four scenarios, “no additional action”, two pathways that limit warming to 2°C, and one pathway that reduces emissions in time to meet a 1.5°C total warming). 70 NGFS Guide to Climate Scenario Analysis, supra note 64, at 14–15. 12
Other jurisdictions have taking varying approaches, with some setting windows in 2050, 2080, and 2100, while others consider a timescale of five years or less.71 If possible, sampling a short, medium, and long-term window would allow the OCC to gain the most thorough understanding of a bank’s risk. It may be particularly important to include a window that is at least thirty years in length, in order to account for the traditional thirty year mortgage cycle and other long-term loans. The mortgages that banks make today, for example, could be on their balance sheets until 2052, at which point the collateral will have faced highly escalated physical risks from climate change. C. In executing scenario analyses, the OCC should be mindful of correlated risks. In executing scenario analyses, the OCC should be mindful of the interplay among correlated risks. Sudden, large shocks to a bank’s portfolio could be more damaging than risks accruing over time in a more manageable fashion. Regional banks, for example, could be at particular risk from geographically correlated risks, such as wildfires or hurricanes. Although non-regional banks benefit from geographical diversity, they are not immune to correlated risks. Climate change may cause shifting environmental conditions and extreme weather events that affect large portions of the world at the same time.72 Furthermore, transition risks are also correlated. Under a scenario that includes decarbonization due to policy or technology changes, for example, there may be mass devaluation of oil and gas assets.73 This could lead to large portions of a bank’s portfolio losing value simultaneously. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently published research investigating the risk to banks from various stranded asset scenarios that may be useful in informing the OCC’s thinking.74 V. The OCC should consider how to mitigate potential harm to disadvantaged communities from banks’ climate risk management strategies. (Draft Principles, Page 1) The OCC recognized in its Draft Principles that banks’ climate risk management strategies have the potential to harm “disadvantaged households and communities”75 that also face disproportionately high physical climate impacts. Recognizing this risk, the OCC should examine how it can take proactive steps to mitigate it, including by offering additional guidance, working with other agencies, and incorporating the input of affected communities. 71 Id. 72 See Condon, supra note 47, at 82–83 (“Recent studies, for example, have highlighted the increasing, yet still largely unanticipated, chance for simultaneous temperature- and weather-induced crop failures in key breadbaskets around the world.”); Jitendra Singh et al., Enhanced Risk of Concurrent Regional Droughts with Increased ENSO Variability and Warming, 12 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 163 (2022), https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01276-3.pdf. 73 See, e.g., Jean-Francois Mercure et al., Macroeconomic Impact of Stranded Fossil Fuel Assets, 8 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 588 (2018), https://perma.cc/7YWU-9ZG3. 74 Hyeyoon Jung et al., Climate Stress Testing, 977 FED.

Due to historical and ongoing injustices, low-income communities and communities of color face heightened climate risks such as flooding, wildfires, and heat stress.76 Some of these inequities can be traced back to redlining, a set of racist housing policies that pushed communities of color into less desirable areas, with disparities in environmental hazards that persist to this day.77 Differential spending on infrastructure, such as sewer systems, and disaster assistance has reinforced this divide in risk.78 Today, a home located in a historically redlined neighborhood is 20% more likely to suffer high flood risk than a home in a greenlined neighborhood.79 Historically redlined neighborhoods also face higher heat stress.80 As a result, if banks decided to reduce lending in areas exposed to higher physical climate risks as a risk management strategy, low-income communities and communities of color could be disproportionately affected.81 The OCC recognizes this concern in its Draft Principles, urging banks to consider “climate-related financial risk impacts on . . . [low- to moderate-income] and other disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products and services.”82 The OCC also advises banks to consider “possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity.”83 The OCC should contemplate whether and how it could revise the Draft Principles to mitigate the risk of inequitably reduced credit access and also how it might work with other agencies to address these challenges more comprehensively, informed by the input of affected communities. For example, in subsequent guidance, the OCC could consider more specifically outlining intersections between climate risk and banks’ obligations under the Fair Housing Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Community Reinvestment Act.84 This could include offering 76 See ANNA CASH ET AL., CLIMATE CHANGE DISPLACEMENT IN THE U.S. – A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE (2020), https://perma.cc/S923-2YNL; Brad Plumer & Nadja Popovich, How Decades of Racist Housing Policy Left Neighborhood Sweltering, N.Y.

recommendations for banks on strategies for reducing climate risk exposure that would preserve lending in low-income communities and communities of color, such as advising banks on how to weigh resilience measures in risk assessments. With other agencies, the OCC could consider supporting the formation of a coordinating structure, such as an interagency working group, focused on the issue of continued credit and insurance access in low-income areas at heightened risk from climate change.85 A non- exhaustive list of potential agency members could include the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates disaster relief funding and is working to update its practices to advance equity and bolster climate resilience;86 the Federal Insurance Office, which is researching climate change-driven insurance coverage gaps;87 the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is working on issues of climate risk and equity in mortgage lending;88 the Treasury Department’s Community Development Finance Institutions Fund and Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration, which facilitate access to funding for low-income communities;89 and other financial regulatory entities. Additionally, the expertise and priorities of affected communities should inform the creation and operation of any such interagency group. * * * LENDING, COMPTROLLER’S HANDBOOK (2010), https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and- resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/fair-lending/pub-ch-fair-lending.pdf. 85 The White House Climate Policy Office has formed similar interagency working groups, including one on flood resilience, in response to Executive Order 14,030 on Climate-Related Financial Risk.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing this letter in reference to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for  climate-related risk management for large financial institutions.  I am a 5th generation community  banker with my family founding BOM Bank in 1903 in Montgomery La. Since our humble beginnings in a  very poor, rural community of 800 people, our bank has been fortunate enough to grow to 17 locations  with over 700 million in total assets.  BOM Bank is a Certified Development Financial Institution (CDFI)  with 15 of our 17 locations located in Persistent Poverty Counties. We operate 15 locations in North and  Central La and 2 locations in Deep East Texas. We are proud to have broken ground on our 18th location  and this location will be in Pineville La in Rapides Parish, which is also a Persistent Poverty County.   Throughout the years of growth, we have never lost touch with who and what has made us the success  we are, that being the citizens of our communities.  I am very concerned that the FDIC will at some point  in the future impose the same climate-related policies on community banks. Over my 28 years at BOM  Bank, it always seems regulations that are imposed on the largest financial institutions invariably end up  being imposed on community banks at some point.  BOM Bank has been in business for 119 years and  during this time-period; we have not only survived but also thrived thru hurricanes, depressions,  recessions, Covid-19, bank-runs, mortgage meltdown and everything else that has happened over the  past century. We know how to underwrite loans and continue to help our communities thrive.  During  the Covid-19 Pandemic, BOM Bank participated in the Paycheck Protection Program and provided much  needed capital in the amount of approximately 165 million to approximately 2000 small businesses. We  provided loan deferrals, waived NSF fees, donated money to food banks, bought food for bank staff  bank-wide from local independently owned restaurants, partnered and volunteered hundreds of hours  with our local hospitals where Covid-19 shots were provided. These are just a small amount of what we  did during Covid-19 and shows that even during the worst pandemic in our nations history, we still  showed up to work, took care of our customers, non-customers and the community as a whole.  I hope  and pray the FDIC only imposes these climate-related risk management policies to banks with more than  100 billion in assets.  I thank you very much for your time and I apologize for the length of this letter.  However, I hope this letter shows I have a love & passion for my communities, customers and the  community banking industry.    With Kindest Regards,      Ken Hale President/CEO   BOM Bank  Ken Hale   Natchitoches, LA","Ken Hale, President/CEO of BOM Bank, expresses concern over the FDIC's climate-related risk management policies potentially being applied to community banks. Hale highlights BOM Bank's history and commitment to serving communities in Persistent Poverty Counties, emphasizing their resilience through economic challenges and their proactive role during the COVID-19 pandemic. He argues that community banks like BOM, with assets under $100 billion, should not be subject to the same regulations as larger financial institutions. Hale underscores the bank's contributions to local economies and communities, advocating for policies that recognize the unique role and challenges of community banks. He concludes by expressing his passion for community banking and hopes the FDIC will consider these factors in their policy decisions."
155,kze-ueik-yuwx,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. You are receiving a significant number of comments - Please take them seriously. Our message may be similar, but our conviction about the importance of the issue of climate change and banks is of the utmost importance. All our children and grandchildren deserve your attention and action. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks’ continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: 1. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; 3. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 4. And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.
Your action is necessary. We are counting on you.","The comment addresses Comptroller Hsu, urging serious consideration of climate change in banking. It highlights the contradiction between banks' public commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their continued investments in fossil fuels, which exacerbate climate change. The commenter emphasizes the risk this poses to the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. They support proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management, plan for long-term climate impacts, define risk exposures, and align internal strategies with public commitments. The commenter calls for the OCC to ensure banks' actions align with their zero carbon commitments and to factor climate risk management into supervisory ratings. They urge the OCC to issue strong guidance and require banks to address climate risks, emphasizing the urgency and necessity of action."

176,kzh-jjr6-yo8o,"Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Introduction The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has identified the effects of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy as presenting emerging risks to banks1 and the financial system.2 Banks are likely to be affected by both the physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change (referred to in these draft principles as climate-related financial risks). Physical risks refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute, climate-related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, and chronic shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. Transition risks refer to stresses to certain banks or sectors arising from the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change. Weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could adversely affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system. Adverse effects could include potentially disproportionate impact on the financially vulnerable, including low- to moderate-income (LMI) and other disadvantaged households and communities.3 Many banks are considering these risks and would benefit from additional guidance as they develop capabilities, deploy resources, and make necessary investments to address climate-related financial risks. These draft principles provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks, consistent with the existing risk management framework described in existing OCC rules and guidance. The principles are intended to support efforts by banks to focus on key aspects of climate risk management. The principles will help bank management make progress toward answering key questions on exposures and incorporating climate-related financial risks into banks’ risk management frameworks. Although all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks, these draft principles are targeted at the largest banks, those with over $100 billion in total 1 In this issuance, the term “bank” refers collectively to national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies of foreign banking organizations. 2 See e.g. Semiannual Risk Perspective at pp. 2-4 (Fall 2021), available at https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications- and-resources/publications/semiannual-risk-perspective/files/pub-semiannual-risk-perspective-fall-2021.pdf. For additional background, see generally Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, Financial Stability Oversight Council (Oct. 21, 2021) (FSOC Climate Report). 3 For further information, see Staff Reports, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Understanding the Linkages between Climate Change and Inequality in the United States, No. 991 (November 2021), available at https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr991.html.
consolidated assets. The OCC is inviting public feedback on the principles for 60 days, until February 14, 2022. The OCC plans to elaborate on these principles in subsequent guidance that would distinguish roles and responsibilities of boards of directors (boards) and management, incorporate the feedback received on the principles, and consider lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions. In keeping with the OCC’s risk-based approach to supervision, the OCC intends to appropriately tailor any resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models. General Principles Governance. An effective risk governance framework is essential to a bank’s safe and sound operation. A bank’s board and management should demonstrate an appropriate understanding of climate-related financial risk exposures and their impact on risk appetite to facilitate oversight. Sound governance includes reviewing information necessary to oversee the bank, allocating appropriate resources, assigning climate-related financial risk responsibilities throughout the organization (i.e., committees, reporting lines, and roles), and clearly communicating to staff regarding climate-related impacts to the bank’s risk profile. Responsibility and accountability may be integrated within existing organizational structures or by establishing new structures for climate-related financial risks. Where dedicated units are established, the board and management should clearly define these units’ responsibilities and interaction with existing governance structures. The board should have adequate understanding and knowledge to assess the potential impact of climate-related risks on the bank and to address and oversee these risks within the bank’s strategy and risk appetite, including an understanding of the potential ways in which these risks could evolve over various time horizons and scenarios. Relevant time horizons may include those that extend beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning horizon. The board should actively oversee the bank’s risk-taking activities and hold management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. Management is responsible for executing the bank’s overall strategic plan. This responsibility includes effectively managing all risks, including climate- related financial risks, and their effects on the bank’s financial condition. Management should also hold staff accountable for controlling risks within established lines of authority and responsibility. Additionally, management is responsible for regularly reporting to the board on the level and nature of risks to the bank, including climate-related financial risks. Policies, Procedures, and Limits. Management should incorporate climate-related risks into policies, procedures, and limits to provide detailed guidance on the bank’s approach to these risks in line with the strategy and risk appetite set by the board. Policies, procedures, and limits should be modified when necessary to reflect the distinctive characteristics of climate-related risks and changes to the bank’s activities. Strategic Planning. The board and management should consider material climate-related financial risk exposures when setting the bank’s overall business strategy, risk appetite, and financial, capital, and operational plans. As part of forward-looking strategic planning, the board and management should address the potential impact of climate-related financial risk exposures on the bank’s financial condition, operations (including geographic locations), and business 2
objectives over various time horizons. The board and management should also consider climate- related financial risk impacts on stakeholders’ expectations, the bank’s reputation, and LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products and services. The OCC recognizes that the incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time. Any climate-related strategies, including any relevant corporate social responsibility objectives, should align with and support the bank’s broader strategy, risk appetite, and risk management framework. In addition, where banks engage in public communication of their climate-related strategies, boards and management should ensure that any public statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements. Risk Management. Climate-related financial risks typically impact banks through a range of traditional risk types. Management should oversee the development and implementation of processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control climate-related financial risk exposures within the bank’s existing risk management framework. A bank should employ a comprehensive process to identify emerging and material risks stemming from the bank’s business activities and associated exposures. The risk identification process should include input from stakeholders across the organization with relevant expertise (e.g., business units, independent risk management, and legal). Risk identification includes assessment of climate-related financial risks across a range of plausible scenarios and under various time horizons. As part of sound risk management, banks should develop processes to measure and monitor material climate-related financial risks and to inform management about the materiality of those risks. Material climate-related financial risk exposures should be clearly defined, aligned with the bank’s risk appetite, and supported by appropriate metrics (e.g., risk limits and key risk indicators) and escalation processes. Boards and management should also incorporate climate- related risks into their internal control frameworks, including internal audit. Tools and approaches for measuring and monitoring exposure to climate-related risks include, among others, exposure analysis, heat maps, climate risk dashboards, and scenario analysis. These tools can be leveraged to assess a bank’s exposure to both physical and transition risks in both the shorter and longer term. Outputs should inform the risk identification process and the short- and long-term financial risks to a bank’s business model from climate change. Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting. Sound climate risk management depends on the availability of relevant, accurate, and timely data. Management should incorporate climate- related financial risk information into the bank’s internal reporting, monitoring, and escalation processes to facilitate timely and sound decision-making across the bank. Effective risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities allow management to capture and report material and emerging climate-related financial risk exposures, segmented or stratified by physical and transition risks, based upon the complexity and types of exposures. Data, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at a rapid pace; management should monitor these developments and incorporate them into their climate risk management as warranted. 3
Scenario Analysis. Climate-related scenario analysis is emerging as an important approach for identifying, measuring, and managing climate-related risks. For the purposes of this guidance, climate-related scenario analysis refers to exercises used to conduct a forward-looking assessment of the potential impact on a bank of changes in the economy, financial system, or the distribution of physical hazards resulting from climate-related risks. These exercises differ from traditional stress testing exercises that typically assess the potential impacts of transitory shocks to near-term economic and financial conditions. An effective climate-related scenario analysis framework provides a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective that banks can apply alongside existing risk management practices to evaluate the resiliency of a bank’s strategy and risk management to the structural changes arising from climate-related risks. Management should develop and implement climate-related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile. These frameworks should include clearly defined objectives that reflect the bank’s overall climate risk management strategies. These objectives could include, for example, exploring the impacts of climate-related risks on the bank’s strategy and business model, identifying and measuring vulnerability to relevant climate-related risk factors including physical and transition risks, and estimating climate-related exposures and potential losses across a range of plausible scenarios. In the near term, a climate-related scenario analysis framework can also assist the bank in identifying data and methodological limitations and uncertainty in climate risk management and informing the adequacy of its climate risk management framework. Climate-related scenario analyses should be subject to oversight, validation, and quality control standards that would be commensurate to their risk. Climate-related scenario analysis results should be clearly and regularly communicated to all relevant individuals within the bank, including an appropriate level of information necessary to effectively convey the assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty of results. Management of Risk Areas A risk assessment process is part of a sound risk governance framework, and it allows boards and management to identify emerging risks and to develop and implement appropriate strategies to mitigate those risks. Boards and management should consider and incorporate climate-related financial risks when identifying and mitigating all types of risk. These risk assessment principles describe how climate-related financial risks can be addressed in various risk categories. The OCC will elaborate on these risk assessment principles in subsequent guidance. Credit Risk. The board and management should consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios. Effective credit risk management practices could include monitoring climate-related credit risks through sectoral, geographic, and single-name concentration analyses, including credit risk concentrations stemming from physical and transition risks. As part of concentration risk analysis, management should assess potential changes in correlations across exposures or asset classes. The board and management should determine credit risk appetite and lending limits related to these risks. 4
Liquidity Risk. Consistent with sound oversight and liquidity risk management, the board and management should assess whether climate-related financial risks could affect liquidity buffers and, if so, incorporate those risks into their liquidity risk management and liquidity buffers. Other Financial Risk. Management should monitor interest rate risk and other model inputs for greater volatility or less predictability due to climate-related financial risks. Where appropriate, management should include corresponding measures of conservatism in their risk measurements and controls. The board and management should monitor how climate-related financial risks affect the bank’s exposure to risk related to changing prices. While market participants are still researching how to measure climate price risk, the board and management should use the best measurement methodologies reasonably available to them and refine them over time. Operational Risk. The board and management should consider how climate-related financial risk exposures may adversely impact a bank’s operations, control environment, and operational resilience. Sound operational risk management includes incorporating an assessment across all business lines and operations, including third-party operations, and considering climate-related impacts on business continuity and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape. Legal/Compliance Risk. The board and management should consider how climate-related financial risks and risk mitigation measures affect the legal and regulatory landscape in which the bank operates. This consideration includes possible changes to legal requirements for, or underwriting considerations related to, flood or disaster-related insurance. It also includes possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity. Other Nonfinancial Risk. Consistent with sound oversight, the board and management should monitor how the execution of strategic decisions and the operating environment affect the bank’s financial condition and operational resilience as discussed in the strategic planning section. The board and management should also consider the extent to which the bank’s activities may increase the risk of negative financial impact from reputational damage, liability, or litigation, and implement adequate measures to account for these risks where material. Request for Feedback The OCC welcomes feedback on all aspects of these draft principles, including on the following questions. Among other uses, the OCC would consider responses in connection with developing any future guidance on climate-related financial risks. Refer to OCC Bulletin 2021-62 for instructions on submitting feedback. Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? 5
Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Current Risk Management Practices 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? 6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers?4 What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? 4 “Green bonds” refer to fixed-income securities, the proceeds of which are earmarked for environmentally beneficial investment. 6
Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? 7","The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has proposed draft principles for managing climate-related financial risks in large banks, emphasizing the need for effective governance, strategic planning, and risk management. These principles address both physical risks (e.g., hurricanes, floods) and transition risks (e.g., policy shifts) associated with climate change. The OCC highlights the importance of integrating climate risks into banks' existing risk management frameworks, including governance, policies, strategic planning, and scenario analysis. The draft principles are targeted at banks with over $100 billion in assets, aiming to support their efforts in managing climate risks. The OCC seeks public feedback on these principles to refine future guidance, considering banks' size, complexity, and risk profiles. The proposal also addresses the potential disproportionate impact on financially vulnerable communities and emphasizes the need for banks to consider climate risks in credit, liquidity, operational, and legal risk management. The OCC invites feedback on various aspects, including applicability, challenges, tools, and data needs, to enhance banks' climate risk management practices."

Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, D.C. 20219 Via File Upload to https://regulations.gov/ Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 – Public consultation on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Comptroller Hsu, Thank you for soliciting feedback on the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. Please accept these comments on behalf of Atmos Financial, PBC (“Atmos”). Atmos is a financial technology banking services provider, founded in 2020 with the express purpose of using the power of banking to address the climate crisis. We engage with the banking sector in multiple ways. Specifically, we aggregate deposits from consumers interested in growing a low-carbon economy, and facilitate banks to engage in scalable, low-interest climate-positive loan programs. As a party to lending arrangements with banks subject to OCC regulation, we benefit from regulations that factor climate risk into their risk management practices. We would first like to thank the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for designing these Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We also congratulate the OCC for sharing “Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask.” We agree with the OCC that addressing weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control potential climate-related financial risks is critical to ensuring the safety and soundness of U.S. banks and the global financial system. Below please find our comments in response to some of your specific questions related to the proposed principles. Page 1 of 14
Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? We agree with the OCC that all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks. While we understand that the OCC has designed these proposed principles to initially target banks with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets (i.e., the largest banks), we believe that the existential threat posed by climate change necessitates extending the application of these principles to all US Banks, irrespective of asset size, location, or business model. Climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets, posing grave threats to all banks with increasing frequency and severity. According to NOAA, in 2021 there were 20 separate weather and climate disaster events where losses per event exceeded $1 billion: 688 people lost their lives due to climate-related disasters, and the total financial cost in the United States was more than $145 billion. More importantly, we know these losses will only continue to increase until and unless meaningful action is taken to dramatically reduce emissions in line with science-based targets. These acute and progressive physical risks have the potential to seriously disrupt the stability of the banking system and the communities they serve. For example, in 2021 more than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters and more than 80 percent of Americans experienced a heat wave. Climate impacts are already manifesting in the largest state economies. In just the last few years, our home state of California has experienced record-breaking wildfires, in both number and size, that have taken hundreds of lives, bankrupted our largest utility, left millions regularly without power and brought home insurability into question. Given the lack of significant change in economic systems to materially reduce emissions, these physical risks are certain to increase in frequency and severity in the years to come. We are increasingly concerned that banks that engage in mortgage lending in disaster prone areas may not be sufficiently monitoring the increased likelihood of mortgage defaults after climate disasters. For example, mortgages in Hurricane Harvey FEMA designated counties saw a significant increase in 90+ day delinquency when compared to delinquency rates just six months prior. Within FEMA designated counties, properties estimated to have damage saw a 205% increase in 90+ day delinquency, while properties estimated to have no damage saw a Page 2 of 14
167% increase in 90+ day delinquency.1 In a worst case scenario multiple disasters occurring nearly simultaneously across different parts of the country can create billions of dollars of damages and cumulative losses. This scenario occured in 2018 where 15 named Hurricanes hit the United States causing over $50 billion in damages in the same 6 month period that the Camp Fire in California that caused over $16 billion in losses. Already, insurance is not a guaranteed mitigator for the costs of these risks. As insurance companies begin to pull coverage from areas that face higher risk of wildfires, an increasing number of homes are likely to be designated as uninsurable. Where the science is unmistakable about the likelihood of the increased frequency and intensity of weather events, and it is foreseeable that billions of dollars property stand in harm's way, cascading mortgage delinquencies and potentially defaults could destabilize certain financial institutions without appropriate risk management strategies. Furthermore, the foreseeable risks to property will require clear language for climate related underwriting, collateral and risk standards while ensuring compliance with fair lending laws. In short, climate risk is an existential threat which poses an emerging and increasing threat to U.S. financial stability. Climate risk potentially poses the greatest threat to smaller banks located in higher-risk communities, compared to large banks and smaller banks in climate-resilient geographies. Nevertheless, because climate impact is not geographically contained, and is instead a phenomenon that is caused by and impacts each of us in various parts of the global supply chain, it is appropriate that regulatory guidance be applied across the entire industry. We therefore urge the OCC to extend its Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management to all US banks. We also encourage the OCC to make some or all of these principles prescriptive, rather than voluntary best practices. Using its authority under 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1, we believe OCC can finalize this guidance and enforce it as a mandatory requirement, while creating size- and risk-based milestones that appease those opposed to such regulation. After these guidelines are finalized, the OCC should continue to create even more in-depth requirements. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other foreign financial regulatory agencies are already taking similar steps, and we encourage you to make use of the 1See Kousky, Palim & Pan,(2020) ”Flood Damage and Mortgage Credit Risk: A Case Study of Hurrican Harvey,” Journal of Housing Research, 29:sup1, S86-S120, DOI:10.1080/10527001.2020.1840131Also see Amy Gromwoski,“The Impact of Natural Disaster on Mortgage Delinquency,”CoreLogic, September 2018, available at https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/the-impact-of-natural-catastrophe-on-mortgage-delinquency/; Page 3 of 14
data they are collecting in this process. We also encourage you, wherever possible, to conform US principles and guidance to meet international goals and standards. Acknowledging the cost and burden such guidelines may have on smaller banks, we suggest the OCC implement a staggered timeline to provide smaller banks ample time to incorporate an applicable implementation strategy. A timeline could be determined based on size- and risk-based milestones derived by the OCC. Providing such broad guidance now with ample implementation time will result in the emergence of qualified vendors to ease the capital and knowledge burden for smaller banks to meet these principles. Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? We suggest detailed guidance be provided for all banks to perform a preliminary self-assessment of their own exposure to climate-related financial risk and submit that assessment to the OCC for review. The OCC should provide detailed prescriptive guidance to expand existing risk criteria as a part of periodic self assessments that take into account geographic exposure, scope of operations, and time frames as developed in coordination with FSOC partners. Audit and assurance firms may be able to effectively aid banks in making these assessments though should not be relied upon. Providing simple, but detailed guidance about how banks should undertake climate related risk management modeling would be an important first step. Once banks report the results of these self assessments, the OCC can exercise its oversight authority by tailoring its climate related risk requirements to ensure that data and modeling approaches are uniform and provide the information needed to assess whether more explicit standards are needed. Results of each bank’s self-assessment, reviewable and requiring approval from the OCC, should dictate the timeline under which climate-related financial risk management practices need to be adopted for formal ongoing reporting. Banks with the lowest potential climate-related risk, which likely include smaller banks in less impacted geographies, would be granted the most amount of time to begin formally reporting based on OCC dictated climate-related financial risk management practices. The largest banks should be required to meet the earliest possible Page 4 of 14
deadline due to the systemic impact of their potential exposure and so that such learnings may be applied to smaller banks around the country. Banks will independently assess the increased risks associated with OCC guidance and incorporate such risks into their capital, loan pricing and credit allocation decisions going forward. As banks make such determinations independently, they may find it helpful to have options to unwind “stranded assets” as a result of the physical risks of the climate-related economic transition. As the OCC reviews such options, financial aid should be limited to legacy assets only. Limiting financial aid to assets constructed before a determined date will ensure banks don’t abuse such resources for their own financial gain at the expense of society and climate risk at large. Atmos also recommends that future guidance for banks and bank holding companies involved in the trading and marketing of non-renewable commodities (including physical energy commodities and physical energy commodity derivatives) include a requirement to disclose the impact of climate-related risk drivers (including operational risk) around these products and services. Appropriate disclosures will ensure stakeholders are sufficiently warned of value fluctuation of the bank or bank holding company based on exposure to such commodities. General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Many banks currently lack sufficient knowledge-capital to assess climate-related financial risks. Guidance by the OCC directing banks to perform self-assessments would need to be sufficient and simple enough to be made applicable to all banks. Enabling a tiered implementation timeline incorporating factors like bank size, risk-profile, geographic exposure, etc. will ensure that banks that wield the greatest influence over the safety and soundness of the US economy are carrying the greatest burden related to the adoption of such practices. Analogous to the relationship between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the International Accounting Standards Board, all efforts should be made to conform Principles for Page 5 of 14
Climate-Related Financial Risk Management to internationally driven guidance. Implementing two sets of similar but different guidance will increase the implementation burden and complexity of reporting for large banks in particular operating across regulatory jurisdictions. Below are listed various challenges banks are currently encountering. ● In some cases, banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, or the most relevant scenarios do not provide sufficient detail in some areas critical to financial institutions. ● Climate models are continually being adjusted, while the associated risks to banks and bank holding companies are not updated continuously to incorporate the changing risks to their portfolio holdings. ● Banks’ internal risk departments have no immediate background in assessing climate risk and are not sufficiently informed to make risk-based calls without more prescriptive scientific background. ● Banks may have an imperfect understanding of the risks associated with non-asset based commercial loans, derived from imperfect information provided by portfolio companies. The anticipated plans for the Securities and Exchange Commission to propose climate disclosure for public companies should have a beneficial impact for all banks to gain more comprehensive and consistent information from their large clients. ● Banks may not be fully undertaking a geographic based assessment of their exposure to derivative instruments including mortgage back securities and collateralized debt obligations originated for areas of the country that are particularly vulnerable to the increased physical impacts of climate change, like wildfires, hurricanes and sea level rise, under climate risk scenario modeling. In addition to the technical challenges above, banks may face increasing challenges of managing the potential volatility in the costs of capital or liquidity as climate related financial risks manifest across sectors. Many of these challenges are market-driven and should be permitted to take effect to accelerate change across sectors more broadly but must be monitored and managed to ensure stability across financial institutions as the transition unfolds. The OCC should also make clear that having a transition plan is a crucial part of a bank’s risk management system, and provide guidance as to how these plans should be formed. Current Risk Management Practices Page 6 of 14
4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? N/A 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? It is our understanding that banks are just beginning to incorporate greater review by the board and/or management as it relates to climate-related financial risks. However, review is largely still qualitative and discussion-based while a quantified review of risk and materiality assessment has not been broadly adopted. However, much can be learned from the recent European Central Bank (ECB) economy-wide climate stress tests methodology and results. There the results revealed that climate risks are concentrated in certain regions and sectors. Furthermore, testing revealed that some 70% of loan exposures of euro area banks that are subject to future physical hazards are concentrated in the hands of only 25 banks.2 With a lack of guidance from regulatory bodies, relative to other prioritized issues, there may be a false perception that such risks are likely not near-term nor material enough to warrant an immediate review and policy change. Such perceptions may lead to imprudent financial risk taking that imperils the long-term stability of the financial sector in the absences of regulatory guidance. 6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? It is our understanding that banks generally are not considering climate-related financial risks with time horizons longer than five years. The short-term view of banks broadly is contrary to international goals for addressing the existential threats posed by the climate crisis. In 2020, Ceres produced a report highlighting the risk due to transition risks of the largest banks. In 2021, Ceres prepared an analysis of the physical risks of climate change to banks. Both of these reports highlight the imperative to have a longer time frame in the analysis. 2See European Central Bank, Climate-related risk and financial stability, Project team on Risk Monitoring, July 2021 available at https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.climateriskfinancialstability202107~87822fae81.en.pdf. Page 7 of 14
Climate-related risks should be incorporated over a period of 30 or more years to sufficiently take into account the real risks facing the economy. 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks have used, or have considered using, both insurance and carbon offsets to mitigate climate-related financial risks. Regarding the use of insurance contracts, we believe that the residential and commercial mortgage divisions of large banks are directly exposed to the risk of insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal. Specifically, with the recent increase in acute climate-related physical risk comes the specter of home insurance price increases or possible denial of coverage in certain areas. For example, AIG recently announced plans to leave the California market due to climate risks. The most recent NOAA data shows that the U.S. has experienced 20 separate billion dollar weather and climate disasters in 2021. We believe that the bank market’s reliance on the availability of home insurance for its residential mortgage portfolio in particular could lead to a climate-related gap in risk monitoring. As such, we recommend that banks study the potential impact of residential property insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal on the value, default rate, loss given default, and financing cost of residential mortgage portfolio holdings. We ask the OCC to consider including this risk in “Management of Risk Areas, Legal/Compliance Risk”. There is also risk for other portions of the banks’ portfolios. With regards to the use of carbon offset credits (or other similar carbon trading schemes) as a risk mitigation strategy, Atmos recommends that the primary focus of banks should be on “absolute GHG reductions” through client engagement and portfolio allocation as opposed to “net GHG reductions” via financial engineering. Any such GHG offset strategies should be used sparingly and only as a last resort. Outside of insurance and offsets, banks’ relationships with their clients must be at the heart of any strategy for climate risk mitigation. Arguments that large banks “bank the entire economy” and as a result have no pathway to reduce their climate risk miss the critical role of client engagement and transition, and seek to ignore the banking industry’s willing participation in carbon-intensive practices to date. Business within a sector can be shifted towards companies with a higher share of sustainable assets and/or robust transition plans. The recently released Page 8 of 14
2030 plans from a few of the largest banks take initial steps with some of their client sectors. While further actions are needed, these are good initial steps. The availability of “investable opportunities” is an important factor in how easy it is to mitigate risk through sustainable finance. The current structure of the economy will mean that most banks, particularly the largest ones, will have a “long” exposure to the business-as-usual case and a “short” exposure to the transition scenario. However, proactive banks may be able to capture enough sustainable opportunities to adjust this balance in a way that manages their overall transition risk. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks currently offer their borrowers a variety of “green” products, such as sustainability-linked loans, derivatives with embedded sustainability KPIs, etc. While we encourage banks to support their client’s climate risk management and sustainability efforts, banks should pay attention to the potential unique reputational risks these products entail, such as the risk of “greenwashing” by the bank and/or the borrower. Greenwashing is the process of knowingly or unknowingly conveying a false impression as to how sustainable or environmentally sound a product or service actually is. It can occur when the benefits conferred by the product or service are not material to the bank or borrower, or relevant to the borrower’s primary business activity. It is our opinion that the vast majority of existing products are “green” in name only. Similar to the SEC’s current initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct (SEC Division of Enforcement Climate and ESG Task Force), we encourage the OCC to include a requirement that bank compliance frameworks are updated to include greenwashing surveillance. As such, we ask the OCC to consider including this risk in “Management of Risk Areas, Other Nonfinancial Risk”. New companies and products, including Atmos Financial, are beginning to emerge to help banks with the transition. This emerging sector represents a significant economic opportunity for US-based solutions with global implications. Page 9 of 14
9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? The communities most affected by climate change will likely be those that historically represent LMI and other disadvantaged communities. Therefore it is imperative that banks incorporate this risk element when considering climate-related financial risk strategies. It would not, however, be an acceptable outcome for banks to retract accessibility to banking services and products from groups of disadvantaged communities based on risks from their geographic footprint. The OCC can and undoubtedly should play a pivotal role in assessing the legal and compliance impacts of a banks' strategic climate-related exit from certain geographies or community engagement against the legal and compliance requirements of the Fair Lending Act, National Flood Insurance Act and the Flood Disaster Protection Act. There are various strategies that could be incorporated by the OCC and/or legislative bodies to ensure the continued accessibility of financial products supporting disadvantageous communities. For banks to credibly assess the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities, Atmos sides with other industry thought leaders and recommends that banks commit to principles of diversity, equity and inclusion and that bank board members and senior management are selected from a diverse and inclusive pool of candidates drawn from the communities that the financial institutions serve. Incorporating the principles of a just and inclusive economy is foundational to any effective climate risk management regime. We appreciate the OCC’s decision to withdraw the CRA requirements established by the prior administration. We encourage banks to build on their current efforts to include diverse voices into various levels of decision-making. It is important to have individuals representing different life experiences to advise on key financial decisions. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? Page 10 of 14
What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? We recommend that banks obtain the following data in support of effective climate risk management: ● Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions data from borrowers, ● Information on planned capital expenditures and their likely impact on company emissions, as well as transition plans (if available), ● Geolocational information of all critical borrower infrastructure, ● Borrower climate disclosures prepared using the TCFD framework (banks should encourage borrowers to disclose this information using the TCFD framework to ensure that climate-relevant data is comparable across industries and geographies), ● Likely exposure to financial risks generated from necessary changes to end consumers in highly impacted areas. ● Detailed climate related assessments of collateral including but not limited to projections of the useful life of the asset. To minimize compliance costs, banks should also be encouraged and incentivized by the OCC to actively contribute to the development and sharing of climate-relevant borrower data, as appropriate. Banks should also be encouraged to use a common set of standards, such as the PCAF framework, for measuring their Scope 3 emissions associated with client activities. Without a standardized framework, and conforming that framework to international standards whenever possible, it may be difficult to accurately assess banks’ risk and the effectiveness of their mitigation strategies. However, under no circumstances should banks be allowed to let any perceived difficulty in standardizing assessment protocols preclude inclusion of Scope 3 emissions in their assessments. As banks compute the inventory of GHG emissions associated with their loan portfolio under a PCAF or other framework, banks may indicate the lack of investable opportunities puts undue burden on their shareholders. We do not think this is a valid argument. There is no shortage of opportunities, and scientific evidence has suggested as much as $100T needs to be invested in the clean economy over the next 20-30 years. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? Page 11 of 14
Atmos sides with other industry thought leaders and recommends that existing regulatory reporting requirements for banks be expanded to require the use of the TCFD framework to ensure that public disclosure of climate relevant information is comparable across banks of varying asset size, location, and business model. Additionally, as part of identifying and quantifying climate-related financial risks, Atmos believes that large banks in particular should establish and disclose net zero plans which describe in detail how they plan to decarbonize their business activities and achieve net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Furthermore, large banks should set interim decarbonization goals (for example, 2030 goals) and provide regular updates towards achieving them, to ensure a financially-stable glidepath that ensures we meet the UN’s 1.5 degree target. Finally, all interim goals and 2050 net zero commitments should incorporate the latest science, use credible climate scenarios and disclose decarbonization progress on a sector by sector basis. Detailed disclosure of net zero and interim goals will ensure that large banks sufficiently participate in the decarbonization of the economy just as they disproportionately benefited from the industrial activities leading to the climate crisis. We encourage the OCC to consider augmenting existing regulatory reporting requirements to include this additional risk-mitigating disclosure. Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? Broadly, real estate lending decisions have taken into account likelihood of natural disasters based on historical probability analyses. This form of historical analysis is no longer able to project the future potential for risk. Therefore, science-based scenario analysis is a critical component of measuring climate-related financial risks inherent to a bank’s lending portfolio. The primary challenge confronting most banks will be a lack of prescriptive guidance on which modeling to use, and the incorporation of such modeling. It is unlikely that most banks will be able to make an appropriate science-based determination of that risk. Specialty companies Page 12 of 14
have started to emerge to aid banks in making these determinations. It is our opinion that such practices and assessment specialties will be adopted by audit and assurance firms, speciality companies and insurance companies. This is an appropriate division of power to maintain objectivity, though it requires significant regulation and guidance of such firms providing those services as well as prescriptive guidance on how such information is used to prevent further abuse of disadvantaged communities. The use of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing for regional and community banks can be characterized as being in its infancy. The main challenges they face in advancing their climate scenario analysis and stress testing programs are both technical and operational in nature: ● Some regional and community banks do not yet consider climate to be a material risk factor, and so are not engaging their borrowers in obtaining climate-relevant data, ● When client engagement does occur, borrowers are unable or unwilling to provide climate data (for example, GHG emissions), ● In all cases, regional and community banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, ● Furthermore, they are often waiting for regulatory guidance before investing resources in the design of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress capabilities. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? When designing and executing scenario analysis, at a micro-level, we believe that the scientific rigor and transparency of the scenarios are paramount. As such, banks should ensure that their scenarios: ● Are science-based and aligned with the most current climate change science, ● For transition risk, the scenarios should consider both an “orderly” and “disorderly” transition, ● For physical risk, the scenarios should contain at least one ""worst case"" scenario, ● Assumptions regarding both demand and prices for commodities (such as oil) should be transparent and clearly stated, and ● Scenarios should be aligned with current best practices (i.e., IEA and NGFS scenarios). From a macro-standpoint, the U.S. regulatory regime has proven itself to be robust and flexible enough to meet the challenge of many recent perils. For example, due to the effectiveness of Page 13 of 14
periodic scenario analysis testing and monitoring of capital requirements, regulators have been able to successfully navigate new threats to bank safety and soundness such as cybersecurity and the coronavirus pandemic. We believe that thorough and well executed risk management procedures that include climate-related financial risks can offer similar safeguards for financial stability. Thus when considering which macro factors are most salient to designing and executing climate scenario analysis exercises we recommend that first and foremost the OCC continue to act with a sense of urgency around this existential and systemic threat. Second, as climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets and poses grave threats to banks of all sizes and business models, we recommend that these scenario analysis exercises should be adopted by all U.S. banks irrespective of asset size, location, or business model. Third, the OCC will need to ensure that banks have access to educational resources in support of bank innovation regarding climate scenarios, models and data. Finally, we believe that climate scenario analysis exercises should eventually evolve into a formalized climate stress testing regime which informs regulatory capital adequacy metrics. Without climate stress testing, we believe that banks are at risk of running a higher quantum of enterprise risk than they are aware of, posing a danger to the safety and soundness of our financial system. Once again, we congratulate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for its fine work in developing these Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. Your leadership on this critical issue is deeply valued. We would be pleased to discuss any questions you may have on our feedback. Sincerely, Peter Hellwig, Co-Founder Atmos Financial, PBC Page 14 of 14","Atmos Financial, a financial technology banking services provider, submitted comments on the OCC's Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.

The commenter supports proposed guidance urging banks to integrate climate risk management at all business levels, plan for long-term climate impacts, define risk exposures, and align internal strategies with public climate commitments. They emphasize that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) should ensure banks' actions align with their net-zero carbon commitments and incorporate climate risk management into supervisory ratings. The commenter calls for the OCC to impose significant penalties for non-compliance and to issue strong guidance to mitigate climate risks, protecting both the public and banks."
90,kyn-soiq-qte4,"Developing Climate Risk Assessment Regulations or Climate Risk Regulatory Guidance is a daunting task for many reasons. To begin with, Climate Risk needs to be clearly defined. Many articles and studies on Climate Risk focus on the future and speculate on widely differing scenarios about how Climate Change will affect Climate Risk. In my opinion, commingling Climate Risk with Climate Change is a mistake at this time. The extent and effects of Climate Change remain the subject of a continuing debate about both the degree of climate change, the rate of climate change, and the effects of Climate Change.
When developing possible guidance and potential regulations pertaining to Climate Risk why not start with a “first generation” basic Climate Risk model and then build upon that model with time and experience?
What do I mean by a basic Climate Risk model? What I suggest is that the first generation of Climate Risk Assessments should be based on Climate Risk as it exists today without the controversy surrounding Climate Change speculation. 
This approach has many advantages. First, as with any new regulation, the first generation of Climate Risk Assessment Models will be controversial. Adopting a Climate Risk Model that is based on current-day conditions reduces the speculation and controversy involved when incorporating Climate Change considerations.
Second, there already exists data that measure climate exposure for many natural hazards, including flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, drought, severe cold, and more than a dozen other climate-related phenomena that are currently a real and immediate threat to banks and the communities they serve.
Third, by focusing on imminent climate-related threats, climate risk assessments are not only likely to be more accurate but are more likely to attract more support because it’s easier to perceive and appreciate a threat that currently exists and could happen any day, rather than a threat that may be decades away.
How quickly could such a Climate Risk Assessment Model be developed? The answer is such a model already is available. Using data generated by at least 8 federal agencies GeoDataVision has adapted that data for banking purposes so that risk ratings in that data can be assigned to any bank asset, facility, loan or collateral location, etc. If anyone from the OCC is interested in reviewing the maps and risk ratings within the model, I would be pleased to provide a demonstration. We have written an article for publication regarding the model and are awaiting the approval process. As soon as that article is published (expected the first week of February) we will provide a copy to the OCC. Len Suzio","The comment addresses the challenges of developing Climate Risk Assessment Regulations, emphasizing the need to clearly define Climate Risk separately from Climate Change. The author argues against conflating Climate Risk with Climate Change due to ongoing debates about the latter's extent and effects. They propose starting with a ""first generation"" Climate Risk model based on current conditions, which would reduce speculation and controversy. This model would utilize existing data on natural hazards like flooding and hurricanes, making assessments more accurate and garnering more support by focusing on immediate threats.

An article on the model is pending publication."

137,kze-n9x2-kdll,"4 February 2022 To: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks The United Nations Environment Programme - Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) is a strategic public- private partnership between the UN and over 400 global financial institutions. It has established some of the most important sustainability-oriented frameworks within the finance industry, including the Principles for Responsible Investment, the Principles for Sustainable Insurance and the Principles for Responsible Banking. It also convenes leading net zero alliances of banks, insurers and asset owners which form part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero. Since the issuance of the initial TCFD disclosure guidance, UNEP FI has led pilot programmes for over 100 banks, insurers and institutional investors on climate risk and TCFD disclosures. These programs have convened financial institutions, supervisors, and climate experts with a view to improving climate disclosure and climate risk management across the financial sector. Overview UNEP FI welcomes the publication of the OCC’s Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. This document provides actionable guidance to both financial institutions and financial supervisors. Within this document, we particularly welcome the following: • Continued acknowledgement that climate risks are financial risks and that additional guidance is required within the financial sector for their management • Recognition that climate change poses capital, liquidity, credit, legal/compliance, operational, and other risks • Principles for firms to evaluate their climate risks • A set of operational areas to consider in managing climate risks: governance, policies, procedures, and limits, strategic planning, risk management, data, risk management, and reporting, and scenario analysis • Guidance to consider multiple time horizons and different scenarios in assessing the preparedness of an institution to face climate-related financial risks • Specific guidance on approaches for the monitoring and reporting of climate-related financial risks by financial institutions We have a few reflections and recommendations on the principles that we believe would be helpful to share. In this response, we have addressed the associated consultation questions accompanying this evaluation process.
Questions Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? UNEP FI believes the principles articulated by the OCC are widely applicable to banks of all sizes. At present, they only apply to banks with over 100 billion dollars in total assets. While regulatory reporting or assessment requirements may vary by size and systemic importance of the institution, climate risks do not discriminate. Smaller banks are not immune to climate risks and may even be more susceptible if they are particularly concentrated in vulnerable sectors or geographies. Other supervisors such as the PRA in the UK have espoused similar principles but have not limited their scope by bank size. They instead require that regulated firms adopt a proportionate approach to managing those climate risks to which they are exposed, whilst also providing guidance as to what this might look like in practice. Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? Though UNEP FI’s work across multiple geographies, a constant request from financial institutions is to see examples of good practices in the diverse areas of climate risk management. Case studies on good practice can be a particularly useful resource for institutions as evidenced by the CDSB’s TCFD Good Practice Handbook and the IIF and UNEP FI’s TCFD Report Playbook. In the future, supervisors can also provide more detailed and actionable guidance through reports on the application of their principles. Firms in the Eurozone and UK have, in particular, found the supervisory review reports of the ECB and PRA useful in implementing their climate risk expectations. The work the NGFS has developed in conjunction with its members has also proved useful. When considering examples for inclusion, it is valuable to offer a diversity of examples that are applicable to banks of different sizes, geographies, risk profiles, and complexity. Guidance from regulator-sponsored industry forums has additionally provided useful risk management insights to different firm-types. In the UK for example, the PRA and the FCA co-chair the Climate Financial Risk Forum (‘CFRF’) whose members are drawn from industry. The CFRF has been successful in developing a significant body of practical industry guidance with regards to climate risk management covering diverse topics such as risk appetite statements, data, tools and scenario analysis. UNEP FI’s banking members have found that outreach by regulators has been an effective way for firms to better understand regulatory expectations and regulators to better appreciate current industry practices and challenges. General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? The challenges faced by firms many vary based on the nature of their exposures and the level of maturity in their climate risk program, but some common challenges can be identified. These include: 2
• Quantification of climate risks in both risk management and reporting. This challenge relates to a need to develop suitable models for the quantification, a need for stakeholders to understand and trust the outputs, and a need to assimilate those outputs into existing decision-making processes. • Data limitations. This challenge pertains both to the availability of credible emissions data (especially for small and medium enterprise clients) for transition risk assessments as well as granular data on physical risks for different geographies. The identification of client legal risks is another area where data may be a limiting factor. • Updating existing business practices. This challenge concerns the fact that even when analysis is conducted for TCFD reporting or to meet regulatory requirements, there is no guarantee that it is used to shape future strategy or decision-making. Processes and procedures around underwriting and origination as well as risk limits and thresholds all need to be updated to consider climate risks. As noted in the prior response, the OCC can help firms overcome these challenges through reports that offer example-based guidance on good practices and engagement with industry initiatives dedicated to tackling these challenges. UNEP FI believes that increased regulatory demands for climate disclosure have enhanced the quality of climate-related financial disclosures overall and scenario analysis in particular. Thoughtful regulatory assessments with compliance consequences and capital adequacy assessments can further advance the integration of climate risk management into firms’ existing operations. Current Risk Management Practices UNEP FI believes that these questions can be best answered directly by banks responding to this consultation. However, there are a few points that may be useful to briefly mention along with some resources that explore these topics in greater detail. 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? In 2021, UNEP FI released a report on the landscape of climate risk tools that provides an overview on the features of more than 3 dozen physical and transition risk tools. In March of 2022, a supplement to this report will be released with over a dozen case studies from institutions that have piloted some of the latest commercially available tools. 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? Materiality has been a challenging term to define, but it is worth considering the TCFD secretariat’s perspective: “companies should determine materiality for climate-related issues consistent with how they determine the materiality of other information included in their financial filings.” Complicating this approach may be the long-term and non-traditional nature of climate risks. In addition, considerations of “double materiality” are increasingly important, assessing not only climate risks faced by the firm, but risks that the firm’s activities pose to the climate. UNEP FI believes that heatmapping can be an important tool for initial assessment of the materiality of climate risks. In Beyond the Horizon, UNEP FI and its members developed a transition risk heatmap for a number of sectors and did likewise for physical risks in Charting a New Climate. 3
6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? UNEP FI considers risk assessment over a variety of different time horizons critical to evaluating a firm’s climate risks. While most strategic planning within financial institutions takes place within a 3-5 year time horizon, climate risk demands a wider range of assessment windows. Other organizations and initiatives, such as the investor-led Climate Action 100+, have defined specific horizons for short-term, medium-term, and long-term in ways that might be helpful for the OCC to consider. An example of similar action by a regulator comes from the European Banking Authority, which suggested that firms extend their strategic planning to at least 10 years. 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? Institutions have pursued diverse strategies to mitigate their climate risks including and in addition to the ones mentioned in the question. Some firms have developed exclusion lists or updated underwriting criteria to reduce potential climate risks. Others have set limits and targets on certain sectors or geographies. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers?4 What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? The ESG investing space has grown massively in the last few years. Similarly, demand for green projects has also grown and many firms are experimenting with new green products. The Climate Bonds Initiative has been a thought leader on the origination and development of these new products. Some institutions have gotten actively involved in carbon credit markets as well. With the rise in enthusiasm for ESG finance, scrutiny must be applied by supervisors to ensure claims of environmental impact are not just greenwash and to monitor the potential creation of a green asset bubble. 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? One of the many injustices of climate change is its disproportionate impact on the least fortunate. This holds true on a national as well as global level when considering the negative health effects of fossil fuel combustion or the consequences of worsening extreme events. Climate finance must be careful not to exacerbate the plight of society’s most vulnerable members in an effort to manage risk. Risk management should consider the needs of adaptation finance and community investment. This complex issue will likely require government or international intervention to prevent disinvestment under the guise of risk mitigation. At present, some banks are considering the climate impacts on local communities and supporting investment in climate-resilient infrastructure. Banks have also provided adaptation finance to municipalities and other local governments. 4
Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? As mentioned previously, UNEP FI’s 2021 Landscape Report provides details on climate risk tools. It also covers a variety of data providers. In terms of specific data and metrics, UNEP FI’s recent paper: A Good Practice Guide to Stress Testing contains a data section that elaborates the data requirements for physical and transition risk assessments. From a regulatory perspective, in 2021 the NGFS released a report on bridging data gaps, which highlights progress and remaining challenges in obtaining the necessary data for climate risk assessments. These publications contain common themes regarding banks’ climate data needs. Banks will need to work with clients, public data sources, and potentially commercial data providers to obtain the required data. Key considerations for climate data include: • Transition risk o Asset-level emissions data o Client transition plans o Granular transition pathways with relevant macroeconomic factors (e.g. energy demand, carbon price) o Legal proceedings against clients • Physical risk o Multi-hazard risk forecasts for specific areas o Geolocation of assets o Resiliency plans for assets 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? COP 26 saw the announcement of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which aims to consolidate the work of a number of sustainability initiatives into a coherent standard. In late 2021, the TCFD secretariat released consultations on transition plans, disclosure metrics, and portfolio alignment methodologies. Alignment around both disclosure standards and on good practices for climate risk management is important for financial sector actors. Supervisors can continue to augment their reporting requirements by considering how their requirements align with and build on the work of the ISSB and TCFD. A helpful example of regulatory standards that build on the common TCFD framework comes from the EBA’s Final draft implementing technical standards on prudential disclosures on ESG risks. Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? Banks are increasingly conducting climate scenario analysis for a variety of purposes. Use cases include regulatory assessments: mandated climate disclosures (and TCFD reporting) and climate stress tests, 5
development of a climate strategy, opportunity identification, client engagement, net-zero alignment and more traditional risk management: including updating underwriting criteria and setting climate-informed limits and targets. In conjunction with the Center for International Climate Research (CICERO), UNEP FI has published a guide on the use of integrated assessment models (IAMs) for financial practitioners entitled Pathways to Paris. With Oliver Wyman, UNEP FI also built a transition risk assessment tool that incorporates a variety of NGFS scenarios and their relative impacts on different sectors and geographies. UNEP FI will also be publishing two papers on scenario analysis in Q2 2022 for financial practitioners. The NGFS has developed a dedicated resource for those looking to use both their physical and transition risk scenarios that has proven useful to many institutions. Other commercial and non-commercial organizations are also working on similar scenario databases and tools. Common challenges that banks face when conducting climate scenario analysis include: • Lacking institutional knowledge about important climate scenario assumptions and how to interpret and apply results • Translating climate-related factors into financial risk drivers • Producing analysis that is relevant on the timeframes typically used to set bank strategy • Having adequate coverage of certain sectors and regions (non-energy sectors and non-OECD regions tend to have less data) 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? As 1.5˚ C has become a global climate goal, it would be helpful to make an explicit recommendation that scenario analysis include scenarios aligned to this temperature outcome. As previously stated, risk assessment over a variety of different time horizons is necessary in evaluating a firm’s climate risks. Climate scenario analysis should use scenarios and generate outputs with relevance over multiple time horizons. Other considerations include: • Scenarios considering the combined impacts of both physical and transition risks • Scenarios with varying degrees of economic severity • Transition scenarios with abrupt policy shifts, economic disruptions, and price volatility • Physical scenarios with impacts on supply chains, and the incorporation of tail risks and tipping points Should the OCC have any questions about this response, UNEP FI would be delighted to discuss our perspectives further or answer any related comments or questions. Sincerely, Eric Usher Head, UNEP-FI 6","The United Nations Environment Programme - Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) supports the OCC's Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, emphasizing the need for guidance on managing climate risks, which are financial risks. UNEP FI suggests that these principles should apply to banks of all sizes, not just those with over $100 billion in assets, as climate risks affect all institutions. They recommend providing examples of good practices and detailed guidance to help banks develop climate risk management practices. Challenges include quantifying climate risks, data limitations, and updating business practices. UNEP FI highlights the importance of regulatory engagement and reports to overcome these challenges. They also discuss the need for diverse strategies to mitigate climate risks, the importance of considering impacts on disadvantaged communities, and the necessity of robust data and reporting standards. Scenario analysis is crucial, and UNEP FI suggests including scenarios aligned with the 1.5°C global climate goal. They offer to discuss their perspectives further with the OCC."

Subject: Use the full extent of your authority to curtail banks’ investments in climate change -- Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Document ID: OCC-2021-0023-0001)
To Comptroller Hsu:
Thank you for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. The public supports the new guidance telling big banks to mitigate climate risks.
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and announce new climate plans in which they will phase out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are directly fueling the climate crisis—a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance's recommendations to banks that they:
1. incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
2. plan for climate change over a long-time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
3. develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; and
4. make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must ensure that banks' actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks' management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk, and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.

It criticizes banks for investing in fossil fuels despite public commitments to phase out greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that such investments exacerbate the climate crisis, particularly affecting marginalized communities. The commenter urges regulators to enforce stricter climate-related risk management, including integrating these risks into business operations, planning for long-term climate impacts, and ensuring internal strategies align with public commitments. The comment emphasizes the need for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to hold banks accountable for their climate commitments and to factor climate risk management into supervisory ratings. It also highlights the vulnerability of community banks to climate risks and advocates for reduced emissions as a solution. The commenter calls for the OCC to use its full authority to issue strong guidance and protect against unsafe banking practices, quoting Dietrich Bonhoeffer on the moral responsibility to future generations."

Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, as stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.

We strongly agree with and welcome the FDIC’s acknowledgement of the threats that climate change  poses to the safety and stability of individual banks, the banking sector, and the US financial system  overall.  Background on RMI and Our Expertise   RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms global energy systems through market  driven solutions to align with a 1.5°C future and secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all.  We work in the world's most critical geographies and engage businesses, policymakers, communities,  and NGOs to identify and scale energy system interventions that will cut greenhouse gas emissions at  least 50 percent by 2030.   In July 2020, RMI launched the Center for Climate-Aligned Finance (the Center) to help the financial  sector transition the global economy toward a zero-carbon, 1.5°C future. Through deep partnerships in  finance, industry, government, and civil society, the Center works to develop decarbonization  agreements for high-emitting sectors and supports financial institutions to decarbonize their loan books  and investment portfolios. The Center also works to shape the financial sector’s operating environment  by addressing barriers common to all financial institutions, including those related to financial  regulation.   Beyond Risk Management to Ensure Safety and Soundness   As the FDIC has noted, climate change represents a material financial risk to both individual financial  institutions and the stability of both the domestic and international financial system overall. The price  tag for climate-related damages is already sizeable1 and growing, and there is undeniable momentum  behind a global transition to net-zero. This trend is especially clear within the US financial sector where  net-zero climate commitments have become commonplace, including from seven of the ten largest  commercial banks. This is also true among smaller and regional banks, where attention to climate- related risks is growing through initiatives such as the RMA Regional Bank Climate Risk Consortium, a  consortium dedicated to preparing mid-tier lending institutions for the transition to a low-carbon  economy.2 In other words, banks of all sizes have publicly recognized the need for a new approach to  business-as-usual to effectively address the risks presented by climate change.     1 https://aon.mediaroom.com/2021-01-25-Aon-finds-climate-influenced-weather-is-key-driver-of-268B-global-damage-from- 2020-natural-disasters-with-64-uninsured  2 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rma-forms-new-climate-risk-consortium-for-regional-banks- 301508903.html#:~:text=RMA%20promotes%20an%20enterprise%20approach,well%20as%20nonbank%20financial%20institut ions. 
  In 2021, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) acknowledged that climate change represents a  systemic risk to financial stability and the health of the entire economy. Banking institutions, whose  portfolios comprise a wide variety of interconnected exposures, are especially exposed to climate- related risks. Climate commitments from banks are a welcome step but implementing commitments will  require sweeping changes to the way banks approach their governance, risk assessments, and lending  decisions. Banks can no longer mitigate climate-related risks through hedges or minor adjustments to  their businesses or loan books. Research by Ceres found that the cumulative exposure to the largest US  banks’ syndicated loan portfolios alone could be larger than $500 billion from transition risks3 and over  $250 billion from physical risks,4 far exceeding currently disclosed estimates. In another study from  Cambridge University, researchers found that approximately half of the expected losses that a typical  equity investment would face in response to climate-induced economic shocks would be unhedgeable  unless there is a system-wide response to climate change.5 Accordingly, it is imperative that regulatory  guidance evolve in step, if not ahead of, necessary changes to banking practices.  Relatedly, we also urge the FDIC to evaluate the need for a more systemic approach to effectively  monitor individual bank operations. The FDIC is entrusted with ensuring the safety and soundness of  individual institutions, but, in the context of climate change, the safety and soundness of individual  institutions cannot be determined from individual risk exposures in isolation of broader financial system  dynamics. Given that climate-related financial risks are systemic6 and often endogenous,7 we argue that  the best defense is a good offense, and that banks themselves have a proactive role to play.   Reactive risk mitigation by individual banks fails to address the root of systemic risks. Further, the  endogenous nature of climate-related risks means they are, at least in part, driven by actions taken by  market actors, including financial institutions and regulators.8 Rather than reacting to risks as they  materialize, banks can take steps to proactively address drivers of future climate-related risks through  their pricing strategies and lending decisions. The FDIC, alongside peer regulators, has an opportunity to  pursue a more robust approach to ensuring banks’ safety and soundness by encouraging and  empowering banks to play a proactive role in facilitating a timely, inclusive transition of the real  economy toward net-zero, thereby mitigating a driving source of climate-related financial risks into the  future. A more proactive approach can deliver the dual benefits of reducing individual risk exposures,  while contributing to the long-term reduction of systemic climate-related financial risks facing the US  economy. Such an approach is central to the concept of “climate alignment”9 and our work at the  Center, where we support financial institutions in understanding, leveraging, and capitalizing on their  role in the climate transition.10    3 https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2020-10/Ceres%20Bank%20Risk%20Report%202020%20FINAL.pdf  4 https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2021- 09/Ceres%20Financing%20a%20Net%20Zero%20Economy%20FINAL.pdf  5 https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/system/files/documents/unhedgeable-risk.pdf  6 https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf  7Chenet, Ryan-Collins, van Lerven (2019) Climate-related financial policy in a world of radical uncertainty: Towards a  precautionary approach. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/iipp-wp-2019-13-climate- related-financial-policy-in-a-world-of-radical-undertainty-web.pdf  8 Danielsson, Song Shin, Zigrand (2009) Risk Appetite and Endogenous Risk. https://www.fmg.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020- 08/risk-apetite.pdf  9 https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/impact_principles_for_climate_aligned_finance_report.pdf  10 https://climatealignment.org/ 
  Climate Risks are Relevant for All Banks  While more detailed guidance from the FDIC that further elaborates on the topics discussed in these  Principles will be necessary moving forward, we support the FDIC’s initial approach of issuing high-level  guidance to help banks begin to assess and manage climate-related risks. However, we also believe the  FDIC should appropriately expand and adequately support the implementation of this guidance to all  banks overseen by the agency, including regional, state, and community banks.   Climate change represents a material financial risk to banks of all sizes, and climate-related financial  risks can be concentrated in regions and communities. Compared to larger, more diversified banks,  regional banks may experience higher rates of failure and branch closures in the wake of natural  disasters. Examples can already be seen in the financial sector. For example, consecutive record- breaking losses in 2017 and 2018 California wildfire seasons cost the state’s homeowner's insurance  industry two times the total amount of combined profits since 1991, pushing many smaller insurance  companies to or at the brink of bankruptcy.11 Analysis by Ceres has shown that over 60% of US credit  unions, which similarly face highly concentrated physical and transition risks, are at physical risk due to  both acute and chronic climate-related weather events and hazards while over 7% of Federally- chartered credit unions face moderate to high disruption due to membership fields aligned with carbon- intensive industries.12   Regional, state, and community banks overseen by the FDIC face similar climate-related risks but are  often the least equipped to understand or prepare for them.13 This problem is compounded by the types  of exposures that these banks face. In one study of all domestic FDIC-insured banks, smaller banks were  shown to lend significantly more to small businesses than larger banks, and small businesses as  counterparties often lack capacity to absorb climate-related shocks.14 For example, according to the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 40% of businesses do not reopen after a disaster, and  businesses that do survive may continue to suffer from a lack of access to credit and other vital financial  services.15 Additionally, smaller banks often are exposed to a higher concentration of counterparties in  specific industries, which can be a source of significant transition risk. For example, Zions  Bancorporation, a regional bank operating in the Southwestern US, held collective commercial loan  exposure to mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction of $1.185 billion in 2021. This exposure  represented over 19.5% of its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, meaning that a default of some of  these loans could push the bank’s solvency buffer below regulatory minimums.16 This is especially  relevant for the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), the stability of which is dependent upon the sound  risk management practices, capital adequacy, and future earnings potential of individual members, all of  which could be dramatically impacted by climate change.17 For example, correlated failures among  smaller banks created losses in significant excess of fund revenues during the finanical crisis of 2008 and    11 https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FIO_Climate_RFI.pdf  12  https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/202205/561_The%20Changing%20Climate%20for%20Credit%20Unions.pdf  13 See “Impact on Community Banks and Credit Unions”,  https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/202109/Ceres%20Financing%20a%20Net%20Zero%20Economy%20FINAL.pd f  14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560620302370  15 https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2017/SBCS-Report-on-Disaster-Affected-Firms.pdf  16 https://www.climateriskreview.com/p/us-regional-banks-team-up-to-tackle?s=r  17 https://www.fdic.gov/about/strategic-plans/performance/2022annualplan.pdf 
  2009, prompting the FDIC to take emergency action to maintain fund liquidity.18 Correlated losses  among smaller financial firms due to physical and transition risk events can also aggregately drive  disruption and economic stress throughout the entirety of the US financial system.19   Smaller and regional financial institutions are only beginning to examine and address climate-related  risks. This is especially true as many smaller, publicly traded banks prepare for compliance with other  climate-related financial regulation, such as the SEC’s proposal for climate-related financial disclosures.  We encourage the FDIC to look to developing more tailored resources, tools, and guidance for these  institutions to increase the resiliency of the US financial system against climate-related risks.   Support for the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  While we believe a wider and more proactive approach to regulation is the best way to meaningfully  address climate-related financial risks, we firmly support the FDIC’s draft principles as a complementary  first step. The Center especially supports the following elements of the proposed principles:   1. Making internal strategies consistent with public-facing climate commitments. Operationalizing  and substantiating existing public climate commitments, such as through interim targets20 and  transition plans,21 will require a significant overhaul of how banks conduct business today, especially  smaller banks. Public climate commitments and targets can send a powerful signal of intent,  including internally across banks’ business units. But commitments are only a first step, and the FDIC  is right to call for evidence on how banks organize their businesses to reflect their stated intent.   2. Incorporating climate-related risk management throughout business units. A pre-requisite to  implementing firm-wide climate commitments is the integration of climate-aligned strategies  throughout a bank’s business. Effective climate-related risk management can help banks meet  climate commitments, but as described above, climate risk management and climate alignment are  distinct concepts. They have distinct goals and often lead to different outcomes.22 Empowering  banks to incorporate climate-related risk management at every level of their business will support  banks in better understanding the myriad ways climate risks impact their firm. From here, internal  strategies must go a step further to be consistent with climate alignment commitments. By  proactively acting, through financial and non-financial activities, to mitigate climate risks, integrating  climate alignment strategies inherently supports better integration of risk management.  Our report, Zeroing In: The US Financial Sector Perspective on Net-Zero Lending and Investing,23 is  based on a series of workshops the Center held in December 2020 with nine US banks and ten  institutional investors to understand the challenges they face in implementing climate alignment  commitments. During these workshops, participants from US banks highlighted internal challenges  as a top barrier. One participant likened the transformation necessary for meeting climate  commitments to “changing the DNA of an organization”, requiring an evolution of all business units,  functions, and operational infrastructure. To enable this holistic transformation, participants noted    18 https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/crisis/chap5.pdf  19 https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47026  20 https://rmi.org/how-the-net-zero-banking-alliance-helps-banks-set-interim-emissions-targets/  21 https://rmi.org/five-trends-to-watch-in-climate-aligned-finance-in-2022/  22 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20430795.2020.1848142  23 36 https://rmi.org/insight/zeroing-in/ 
  the need for buy-in from executive leadership and culture change throughout the institution –  including by embedding climate values with portfolio managers and front-office investment teams.  Regulatory clarity was cited as a key opportunity to accelerate these processes, providing the  confidence necessary to reshape internal cultures.   3. Assessing climate risks differently than other financial risks. As the FDIC recognizes, climate poses  meaningful financial risks to US banks. However, because these risks are substantially different from  traditional financial risks, a different approach is required to evaluate their true magnitude and  scope. For one, both physical and transition risks will materialize over longer time periods than  many banks’ strategic planning horizons and must be analyzed accordingly over longer timelines.  Further, as the FDIC’s guidance suggests, it is important for banks to monitor and assess physical and  transition risk exposures across various segments of the economy and a bank’s portfolio, including  potential correlations across those risks. We echoed these positions in a recent analysis of the FSOC  Report on Climate-Related Financial Risks:  Systemic risk means that one financial actor’s vulnerability (or climate risk exposure) can  jeopardize the well-being of other financial actors, corporates, and households economy-wide.  Like dominoes, systemic risks can be passed through “transmission channels,” impacting  seemingly disconnected parts of the economy. Acknowledging that climate risks are dynamic  and interconnected directly challenges traditional approaches to assessing materiality and risk  on an individual asset basis. Instead, systemic risks such as these must be assessed across an  entire portfolio or the financial system as a whole.24  For instance, while the physical risks facing loans to coastal properties may be predictable through  first-order impacts, the complex transmission pathways for climate-related risk factors across entire  economies and lending portfolios require a broader scope and further scrutiny.  4. Developing clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting  limits to those exposures. Despite potential data or methodological uncertainties, starting the  process of measuring banks’ exposures to climate-related financial risks can help spur the  operationalization of climate strategies to reduce those exposures. This includes identifying  essential data needs, engaging counterparties to develop and implement transition plans, and  prioritizing actions based on where attention and resources are needed most, first. Climate risks do  not necessarily require divestment to be mitigated. Clear and consistent metrics can help banks  identify and work to proactively reduce their climate-related exposures, such as by working with  counterparties to develop and implement transition plans. Metrics can also help banks make  meaningful progress on integrating organization-wide climate risk assessments and monitoring  capabilities. Finally, we support the inclusion of escalation procedures to encourage attention to  climate-related exposures by boards and management.   5. Iteratively utilizing measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing climate-related  financial risks as they evolve and mature. To steer portfolios to align with their climate goals, banks  will require data and metrics that are granular (i.e., asset-specific), forward-looking, and address the  most significant drivers of emissions.25 While data and disclosures are constantly improving, we    24 https://rmi.org/we-read-a-130-page-report-on-climate-regulation-so-you-dont-have-to/  25 https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/impact_principles_for_climate_aligned_finance_report.pdf 
  support the FDIC’s guidance that banks should act now with best available resources, and then seek  to integrate updated resources over time. In its 2021 report, FSOC advised that not only can tools  like scenario analysis be used to assess climate risks in the absence of perfect data, but their use can  support data improvements over time.26 Where data gaps persist, we encourage that banks actively  seek data directly with corporates and/or through collaborative partnerships with peers, data  providers, and regulators to drive improved data accuracy and availability. To reinforce these  efforts, we encourage the FDIC, in line with FSOC's recommendations, to work with the banking  sector and other financial regulators to improve the availability and quality of climate-related  models and data.   6. Managing fair lending concerns for low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities. We strongly  support the FDIC’s disparate impact standard in examining banks’ responses to climate exposures,  and we agree that banks would benefit from additional guidance on this matter. A focus on LMI  communities aligns with FSOC’s acknowledgement that low-income and historically disadvantaged  communities are not only disproportionately impacted by climate change but also the least  equipped to cope with climate shocks. This dynamic exacerbates existing inequalities and amplifies  risks to the financial sector overall when shocks occur. Improving the availability and accessibility of  financial products and services is essential for enabling an inclusive, economy-wide transition,  thereby reducing one driver of systemic risks. This will require a dedicated, tailored approach by  financial institutions to meet the unique needs of these communities. Further, regional and  community banks, which play an outsized role in LMI and rural communities, are under-resourced to  address climate risks. We understand FDIC’s initial focus on developing principles for large banks.  However, moving forward, providing tailored guidance and support to regional and community  banks, including ensuring their access to quality data, tools, and services, will be especially  important.   In conclusion, climate-related physical and transition risks are widely accepted to be prevalent and  material to US banks of all sizes, with stark implications for the US economy, including financial markets,  communities, and households nationwide. We support the FDIC‘s efforts to revisit and update guidance  for the safe and sound management of climate-related financial risks in this unprecedented and evolving  operating environment to proactively mitigate their most severe impacts.

The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate. Your first duty is support of  your species. Your P-N-L and Stock reports are somewhere distant behind your duty to survival of  Humanity. Temporary gains do not advance mankind.","The comment addresses Comptroller Hsu, expressing gratitude for addressing climate change in relation to banks. It criticizes banks for claiming to take climate change seriously while investing heavily in fossil fuel companies, which exacerbates climate change and endangers the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. The commenter urges regulators to prevent banks from making short-term decisions that threaten the economy and communities. They support the proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management, plan for long-term climate impacts, define risk exposures, and align internal strategies with public climate commitments. The commenter emphasizes the importance of banks' actions matching their zero carbon emission commitments and suggests factoring climate risk management into supervisory ratings. They call for the OCC to issue strong guidance to banks on climate risk and prioritize humanity's survival over temporary financial gains."

Sheesley  Attn: Comments – RIN 3064-ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429      Re:    Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (RIN  3064ZA32)    Dear Mr. Sheesley,    On behalf of ANB Bank (ANB), thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) Statement of Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Financial Institutions (RIN 3064ZA32).    ANB BANK BACKGROUND:    ANB is a $3.2 billion community bank headquartered in Denver, Colorado.  ANB consists of 29 locations  in the United States, specifically in Colorado and Wyoming.  The bank serves a number of distinct and  diverse communities, ranging from large metropolitan cities in Colorado, to rural communities in  Wyoming and western Colorado, to high-cost resort communities in Colorado.   As a community bank,  ANB strives to meet the diverse borrowing needs of our customers in each unique community we serve,  offering a wide range of lending solutions from mortgage and small business loans to commercial real  estate and agriculture loans.  We also provide energy financing, focused on traditional oil and gas  production as well as renewable energy.      ANB BANK RISK MANAGEMENT:    ANB intentionally maintains a low to moderate risk profile, and our risk management practices closely  align with our commitment to serving our customers and communities.  We have developed risk  strategies, policies, procedures, and limits to monitor and manage all lending risks.  Our localized  presence in the communities we serve helps us understand and anticipate risks that large, national  organizations without a local presence may not envision.  These risks include those related to weather  or climate and indirect climate-change risks due to regulatory change or changes in consumer  preferences.       RECOMMENDATIONS:    ANB recognizes the importance of adequately preparing for the potential impact of climate change and  the transition to a low carbon economy.  As such, the bank is supportive of the FDIC’s Principles for  
      Climate Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions and offers two primary recommendations:    A) Maintain the proposed asset size threshold of $100 Billion and formally recognize that smaller  institutions with localized knowledge of their markets adequately manage climate-related risk  through existing risk-management frameworks.      B) Consider the potential for unintended consequences in both design and implementation, and  provide additional guidance to mitigate unintended impacts to communities, industry sectors,  and the economy as a whole.     $100 Billion Asset Size Threshold    Community banks have a different level of climate risk when compared to the largest financial  institutions with a national presence.  For community banks, climate risk is more localized and  understandable.  Serving local communities allows community/regional banks to directly manage  localized climate risks without applying a ""one-size-fits-all"" risk management framework.      As an example, ANB has developed policies and procedures to manage the physical risk of weather and  climate events.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and forest fires present the highest risk to our  borrowers and their property within our footprint.  As a result, the bank has implemented detailed  property and collateral insurance procedures to ensure loans are sufficiently insured before originating  and throughout the life of the loan.  This direct approach to risk management allows the bank to be  more specific in helping to protect our borrower's property against weather or climate risks.    Like the bank's risk mitigation practices on an individual loan level, the bank's overall credit risk  governance framework is proven, well thought out, and designed to maintain a low-to-moderate risk  profile.  This framework includes (1) a quarterly Allowance for Loan Loss Reserves analysis which  incorporates local economic, industry sector, and real estate market analysis, (2) a quarterly liquidity  analysis, (3) a semi-annual loan portfolio concentration analysis, and (4) numerous monthly loan reports  presented to the bank's Board of Directors.  The requirement to complete similar reports and analyses  specifically for climate risks would be burdensome and result in duplication of risk analysis and  mitigation efforts.            While all financial institutions have climate-related risks, the proposed principles must recognize that  community banks have comprehensive risk-management practices that incorporate ""on-the-ground""  knowledge of local markets and address many potential risk factors, including those associated with  climate change.   As such, ANB strongly recommends that the FDIC maintain the proposed asset size  threshold of $100 billion and encourages the FDIC to incorporate language in the principles that  properly recognizes the localized risk management strategies of community banks and diminishes the  temptation to reduce this threshold over time.     Consider Unintended Consequences    The statement of principles must consider the potential for unintended consequences.  Any regulatory  directives related to climate-risk management must be thoughtful in both design and implementation in  order to avoid unintended consequences, such as limiting credit availability to “dis-favored” industries.      For example, if an outcome of the statement of principles is a significant reduction in the availability of  credit to the oil and gas industry, there will be severe follow-on effects to local communities and related  industries (such as agriculture) that are dependent on the oil and gas industry.   Smaller, rural 
    communities served by community banks such as ANB will suffer the greatest economic harm and often  have the least resources to cope.  Community banks can, and will, be a lifeline for many but many rural  communities are already “banking deserts” due to consolidation.  Negatively impacting industries like oil  and gas or agriculture will make this problem much worse, leaving many communities stranded  financially at a time of great need.    Additionally, the needs of a community are defined by their location and local industries that have  evolved over many years.  These needs are not by choice and not easy to change.  Community banks like  ANB are committed to meeting the needs of their local communities, even when those needs are  unpopular with Washington politicians and regulators.   To the extent that the statement of principles  becomes an “unofficial” examiner expectation for smaller banks, the ability of community banks like  ANB to serve our communities will be limited.      Unintended consequences such as those noted above may result in both localized and systemic risks  that are not easily predicted or mitigated.  ANB strongly encourages the FDIC to incorporate language in  the principles that (1) discourages financial institutions from taking actions that would result in  unintended consequences such as reduced credit availability to specific industry sectors, and (2)  discourages examiners from unofficially applying these expectations to smaller institutions.    CONCLUSION    In conclusion, ANB recognizes the importance of these risk management principles for large Systemically  Important Financial Institutions.  However, expanding these requirements to smaller financial  institutions would be burdensome, duplicative, and unnecessary.       Additionally, unintended consequences must be avoided.  While climate change is a source of risk that  must be managed, withdrawing support for disfavored industries would likely have significant and  harmful downstream impacts to local communities as well as the community banks committed to  serving those communities.  The statement of principles must thoughtfully consider potential  unintended consequences.     On behalf of ANB, thank you again for the opportunity to provide input on this rulemaking, and we  would welcome the opportunity to discuss these comments further.  If you have any questions or would  like clarification regarding anything contained in our comments, please don't hesitate to contact me at  303-394-5045 or via email at shawn.harrison@anbank.com    Sincerely,     Shawn Harrison  First Senior Vice President  Senior Credit Officer","ANB Bank, a $3.2 billion community bank, responds to the FDIC's climate risk management principles for large financial institutions.

They caution against unintended consequences, such as reduced credit availability to industries like oil and gas, which could harm local economies and communities. ANB stresses that community banks are vital in serving local needs and warns that applying these principles to smaller banks could be burdensome and unnecessary.

349,2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-036,"June 3, 2022    Mr. James Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429    RE: STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES FOR CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR LARGE  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS [RIN 3064-ZA32]    Dear Mr. Sheesley:    The Independent Community Bankers of America (“ICBA”)1 is pleased to provide comments in response  to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC” or “the agency”) request for information  regarding its statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial  institutions (“the FDIC principles”).2      ICBA appreciates the FDIC limiting its proposed climate-related financial risk management framework to  financial institutions with more than $100 billion in assets.  Nevertheless, ICBA is concerned the FDIC  principles, if finalized, will have far-reaching consequences that will negatively impact the small  communities serviced by community banks.  ICBA is also concerned the FDIC principles will eventually be  applied to community banks, forcing an untenable and unnecessary regulatory burden upon the nation’s  smallest banks and their customers.3       1 The Independent Community Bankers of America® creates and promotes an environment where community  banks flourish. With nearly 50,000 locations nationwide, community banks constitute roughly 99 percent of all  banks, employ nearly 700,000 Americans and are the only physical banking presence in one in three U.S. counties.  Holding nearly $5.9 trillion in assets, over $4.9 trillion in deposits, and more than $3.5 trillion in loans to  consumers, small businesses and the agricultural community, community banks channel local deposits into the  Main Streets and neighborhoods they serve, spurring job creation, fostering innovation and fueling their  customers’ dreams in communities throughout America.     2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Financial Institutions, RIN 3064-ZA32, 87 FR 19507, (April 4, 2022) available at: https://www.govinfo.gov  /content/pkg/FR-2022-04-04/pdf/2022-07065.pdf.    3 For example, in a statement accompanying the publication of the FDIC principles, Acting Chairman Gruenberg  expressly stated, “all financial institutions, regardless of size, complexity, or business model, are subject to climate- related financial risks.”  FDIC, Statement by Martin J.

Page 2 of 10    Additionally, ICBA is troubled the agency published the FDIC principles without first conducting any  independent studies or gathering empirical data from FDIC supervised institutions to examine the extent  to which banks may or may not be managing climate related financial risks, and in turn, the degree in  which climate risks may, or may not, pose an immediate threat to bank safety and soundness or the  stability of the financial system.4  The FDIC principles are nearly identical to the OCC’s draft principles for  climate-related financial risk management for large banks (“the OCC principles”), which the OCC  published only six months ago.  Notably, the OCC principles were also published without that agency  performing any studies or gathering empirical data to demonstrate climate-risks are a threat to bank  safety and soundness.5      The absence of empirical data to support the publication of either the FDIC principles or the OCC  principles coupled with the FDIC’s repurposing of the OCC principles suggests the true aim of this  proposal may be to effectuate “Operation Chokepoint” by choking off legal but climate disfavored  businesses and industries from the financial system.  Operation Chokepoint was a misguided agency  initiative that should never be resurrected, no matter how laudable the end-goal may be.    In light of these concerns, ICBA appreciates this opportunity to reiterate the comments we offered in  response to the OCC’s proposed framework, offer our recommendations for how the FDIC principles or  future guidance can be improved, and share our reasoning why the FDIC should not apply this proposed  climate risk management framework to community banks.    I.  The FDIC Has Not Published Empirical Data to Support Its Conclusion that Climate-related  Financial Risk Is a Threat to Bank Safety and Soundness.     On May 20, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Treasury, as  the Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), to “engage with FSOC members” to assess  climate-related financial risk.6   In response to the Executive Order, the FSOC subsequently published a  report on climate related financial risks, which directed FSOC members to “address climate-related  financial risks consistent with their mandates, focusing on the safety and soundness of regulated  institutions.”7  Only two months later, on December 16, 2021, the OCC published the OCC principles  which set forth the sweeping conclusion that “weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and    4 See FDIC, Statement by Martin J. Gruenberg, Acting Chairman, FDIC Board of Directors on the Request for  Comment on the Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (March 30, 2022) available at: https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/2022/spmar3022.html, wherein  the Acting Chairman stated, “The effects of climate change and the transition to reduced reliance on carbon- emitting sources of energy present emerging economic and financial risks to the safety and soundness of financial  institutions and the stability of the financial system.”      5 See generally Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management  for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021) available at: https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr- occ-2021-138a.pdf.      6 Exec.

Page 3 of 10    control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could adversely  affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system.”8       While both the President and the FSOC asked the federal financial regulators to explore climate-related  financial risks consistent with their mandates, neither concluded climate-related financials risk  constitutes a safety and soundness risk to individual banks.  Yet, the OCC principles and the FDIC  principles cite the FSOC Report as the definitive support for the agencies’ conclusions that climate- related financial risks may threaten bank safety and soundness.      The echo chamber between the FSOC, the OCC, and now the FDIC is reverberating.  ICBA questions why  the FDIC has not offered its own additional, independent, or separate evidentiary, statistical,  meteorological, or empirical support for its position, or cited even a single instance of bank failure  related to an extreme weather event or due to a bank’s failure to manage climate-related financial risk.   Additionally troublesome is that the FDIC has not acknowledged that other federal financial regulators  have concluded “the average FEMA disaster is not detrimental to bank stability.”9     Without more data to support its conclusions, any final rules or guidance the FDIC issues on climate- related financial risk could be deemed arbitrary and capricious.  To mitigate these concerns, we  encourage the FDIC to gather empirical data, conduct studies, and coordinate with the members of  FSOC, as well as other government stakeholders including the SBA, FEMA, and USDA, prior to engaging  in further rulemaking or issuing additional guidance related to climate-related financial risk.      II.  The FDIC Should Explain Its Approach to Climate-related Financial Risk Is Not Intended to  Facilitate “Operation Chokepoint.”    ICBA is concerned the FDIC principles, however well-intentioned the framework may be, will politicize  the agency, jeopardize the independence of the agency, and discourage banks from doing business with  legal but climate disfavored industries such as carbon-intensive industries.  Because the FDIC principles  broadly apply to every facet of risk management, and do not provide guidance to banks or examiners to  differentiate material climate-related risk exposures from all conceivable climate-related risk exposures,  there is a troubling possibility the FDIC could cite deficiencies in climate-related risk management at  every bank in every examination.  As such, ICBA is concerned the FDIC could use the FDIC principles to  implement “Operation Chokepoint” and pressure banks to terminate business relationships with clients  engaged in lawful activity by “de-risking” their portfolios and declining basic banking services, such as  deposit accounts and loans, to entire categories of industries the FDIC believes may present climate- related financial risk.      The FDIC broadly defines “transition risks” as “stresses to certain banks or sectors arising from the shifts  in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to    8 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large  Banks (Dec. 16, 2021) available at: https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021- 138a.pdf.      9 Staff Reports, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, How Bad are Weather Disasters for Banks?, No. 990 (Nov. 2021)  at page 9 (emphasis added) available at: https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr990.    
Page 4 of 10    limit climate change.”10  Although the FDIC does not further define transition risks, provide examples of  transition risks, or specify which industries or occurrences might pose the most material transition risks,  the FDIC principles require large financial institutions to analyze transition risk considerations within  every aspect of risk management, including governance, policies, procedures and limits, strategic  planning, risk management, data risk measurement and reporting, and scenario analysis.  The FDIC  principles also require large financial institutions to analyze transition risks within every facet of risk  assessments including credit risk, liquidity risk, other financial risk, operational risk, legal and compliance  risk, and other nonfinancial risk.    Both the breadth and lack of specificity in this proposal leave open the possibility that any number of  lawful industries could be choked off from the financial system for posing climate risk, including  industries that are carbon-intensive, or consume large amounts of water, energy and other natural  resources, or produce, supply, or consume fertilizer and chemicals, or generate waste, and the list goes  on.      It is plausible an examiner could broadly interpret the FDIC principles in such a way that any banking  activity that poses a physical or transition climate risk must be eliminated entirely. Banks should not be  forced by their regulator to de-risk entire categories of business customers based on speculation that   transition risks, no matter how remote, could negatively impact the customer. Further, while  community banks typically are not the primary source of financing for large energy producing  companies, they do provide the majority of small business credit in those communities where energy  production, refinement, transportation and other ancillary businesses exist.  Policies that would reduce  access to credit to those businesses because they are connected to the fossil fuel industry would have  devastating impacts on the local economies served by community banks.            The Department of Justice has concluded that Operation Chokepoint was a “misguided initiative” and  that “law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular  administration might disfavor.”11  If the FDIC has no intention of forcing banks to de-risk their portfolios  or choke off lawful but climate disfavored industries from the financial system, the agency should make  this abundantly clear in any finalized guidance and/or rules and state there will not be a supervisory  expectation that banks de-risk entire geographies or industries from their lending portfolios.    III.  Current Risk Management Practices Adequately Protect Community Banks from Climate- related Financial Risks.      As stewards of their local communities, community bankers have every incentive to ensure their lending  practices support the long-term prosperity of their local economies.  A community bank cannot flourish  without the success of the local community because its customers and loan portfolios are geographically  concentrated within the local markets the community bank serves.  The risks of economic shocks,    10 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Financial Institutions, RIN 3064-ZA32, 87 FR 19507, (April 4, 2022).     11 Letter from Stephen E.

Page 5 of 10    customer displacement and damaged collateral (risks the FDIC characterizes in the context of climate  change as “transition risks” and “physical risks”) are not novel risks for community banks to manage,  and each of these risks, if not properly managed, undoubtedly has the potential to impact a community  bank.  But history has shown that because community banks are experts in managing their risk,  community banks do not fail simply because climate-related financial risks exist.  This fact is evidenced  by the FDIC’s failure to publish any empirical data to explain the Acting Chairman’s conclusion that  “climate-related financial risks pose a clear and significant risk to the U.S. financial system, and if  improperly assessed and managed, may pose a threat to safe and sound banking and financial  stability.”12  Importantly, although FDIC data shows 4,104 U.S. banks have failed since 1934, the FDIC  principles do not describe a single instance of bank failure due to a bank’s improper management of  “physical risks” and “transition risks” related to climate change.13      While the FDIC believes “financial institutions are likely to be affected by both the physical risks and  transition risks associated with climate change,” these “affects” are not necessarily negative, and do not  ipso facto constitute threats to bank safety and soundness.   In fact, in a recent New York Federal  Reserve staff report titled, ”How Bad are Weather Disasters for Banks?” (“the Staff Report”), the  financial regulator evaluated all FEMA disasters and found “generally insignificant or small effects on  bank performance and stability.  In particular, loan losses and default risk at local banks [did] not  increase significantly . . . [m]oreover, not all effects are bad; income of multi-county banks increase  significantly with disaster exposure.”   According to the Staff Report, “local banks” (i.e. community  banks) have “superior geographic knowledge” that “helps them avoid areas where disaster risks are  more frequent than expected based on common knowledge.”14  Community banks have superior  geographic knowledge as compared to their large-bank counterparts because “banks located closer to  their borrowers have been found to harbor knowledge of both borrowers and local risk that more  distant lenders may lack.”15  For example, “local banks reallocated mortgage lending from census tracts  where flood risks seem understated relative to the FEMA maps (given recent flooding experience).”16  By  contrast, the Staff Report’s authors did not observe similar behavior at multi-county banks.17      12 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Statement by Martin J.

Page 6 of 10    The detailed findings from the New York Federal Reserve are strong evidence community banks do not  need additional regulation to manage climate-related financial risks.  Since the late 19th century,  community banks have successfully implemented risk management practices, and in so doing, have  weathered and survived every type of natural disaster, including catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes,  earthquakes, wind events, droughts, freezes, snowstorms, wildfires, landslides, volcanoes, and flooding.   As detailed below, community banks’ current, validated, and long-standing risk management practices  are not only adequate for community banks to evaluate climate-related financial risks, but they are also  effective in ensuring community banks are operationally resilient and protected from failure in the  aftermath of economic shocks and natural disasters.     a. Disaster Preparedness and Response  Community banks are well-equipped to prepare for and respond to natural disasters and property  losses.  Community banks maintain detailed business continuity plans which outline the processes the  bank will follow before, during, and after a natural disaster to safeguard employees, customers,  products and services, and remain operational with limited business disruption.18  These disaster plans  are not obscure documents buried in dusty file drawers but are instead meticulously prepared, diligently  tested, and carefully guarded reference guides that bank employees are ready to follow at any  moment’s notice.  Business continuity plans not only contemplate the physical destruction of bank  collateral, including the bank headquarters, ATMS, and branches, but also detail how the bank will  respond to the needs of its customers and the community-at-large, and, in particular cash needs, in the  aftermath of a disaster’s destruction.  As part of these plans, community banks proactively ensure they  have enough cash on hand to meet customer needs and that redundant systems are in place so  customers can continue to use debit cards and banks can readily access digitally stored bank records.   Community banks also contemplate how bank employees can continue to utilize operationally critical  systems and communicate with bank personnel, emergency responders, regulators, customers, and  vendors in the event there is a loss of power, loss of physical bank records, inaccessible roadways, and  displaced bank employees and customers.      b. Concentration Risk Management  Community banks are also adept in managing other types of risks, such as concentration risk, under the  FDIC’s existing risk management framework.  Every community bank portfolio is concentrated  geographically, thus all community banks are exposed to some degree of credit concentration risk.  Yet,  exposure to concentration risk, even significant concentration risk, is not indicative that a bank will fail  or that the bank should be subject to heightened supervisory scrutiny.  Instead, the relevant inquiry is  whether the concentration risk is material and whether the bank has properly managed its risk  exposures.  To measure the materiality of concentration risk, community banks and their regulators  evaluate the quantity of risk exposures, the quality of a bank’s risk management framework, the  strength of bank governance, the adequacy of internal controls, and perform stress tests.  As  demonstrated during thousands of examinations, community banks are adept in mitigating risk due to  seasonal weather changes and natural disasters, and credit concentration and should not be subject to  additional burdensome, costly, duplicative, and unnecessary climate-related risk management practices.    18 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FIL-62-2017, Interagency Supervisory Examiner Guidance for  Institutions Affected by a Major Disaster (Dec. 15, 2017).  See also FFIEC, Business Continuity Management Booklet  available at: https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/business-continuity-management.aspx.     
Page 7 of 10      c. Underwriting Practices and Estimating Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (“ALLL”)  Existing due diligence and underwriting practices enable community bankers to carefully assess the level  of risk posed by every customer relationship and ensure effective controls are in place to monitor these  relationships on an ongoing basis.  If necessary, community banks will shorten the maturity of their  loans to protect the bank not only from interest rate risk but also from many different types of  underwriting risks including climate risks.      Additionally, under the current supervisory framework for estimating credit losses, banks are expressly  required to consider “qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses  associated with the institution’s existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience.”19 The FDIC  and other prudential regulators expect allowance estimates for ALLL to be “based on a comprehensive,  well-documented, and consistently applied analysis of the loan portfolio, and should take into  consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including  environmental factors such as industry, geographical, economic, and political factors.”20     Plainly stated, the qualitative and environmental factors community banks currently use to analyze the  adequacy of ALLL already estimate and quantify climate-related financial risk.  For example, if a bank is  located in a market that is in severe drought, the bank will increase qualitative and environmental  factors to account for this increased risk to the loan portfolio, which in turn results in an increase in the  bank’s allowance estimate.  Since community banks already consider qualitative and environmental  factors as part of their “comprehensive, well-documented, and consistently applied ALLL analysis,” and  since most community banks will be subject to CECL by 2023 and be required to be forward looking with  their estimates of loan losses, a separate risk management framework for climate risk is unnecessary.    d. Securing Insurance Policies to Offset Risk  With respect to their lending and investment activities, community banks are keenly aware of the  importance of risk mitigation particularly during times of economic stress or extreme weather  events.  To mitigate climate, disaster, and concentration risks, community banks ensure their property  loans have adequate flood insurance and their agricultural loans have adequate crop insurance.  Crop  insurance allows agricultural producers to recover from severe weather disasters and repay their farm  loans.     Additionally, community banks diversify their agricultural loan portfolios by utilizing the safety nets,  insurance, and market protections for farmers and agricultural lenders authorized by the farm bill,  including the Farm Service Agency’s Guaranteed Farm Loan Programs.  The farm bill, adopted by  Congress approximately every five years, provides an income safety net for commodity prices to bolster  income for farmers and ranchers. The farm bill also offers farmers and ranchers several guaranteed farm  loan programs. The guaranteed farm loan programs protect up to 90 – 95 percent of the loan principal,    19 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of Thrift Supervision, Interagency Policy  Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, available at:  https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws  /rules/5000-4700.html.    20 Id.  
Page 8 of 10    thus ensuring the repayment of most of the loan principal should farmers and ranchers become unable  to repay their loans. These programs also help protect community banks against loan losses by providing  tools to manage their concentration risks, which is particularly important to banks that specialize in  agricultural lending.    IV.  Mandatory Scenario Analysis Is Not Appropriate for Community Banks.     Scenario analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise that should not be mandatory for  community banks.  To perform mandatory scenario analysis, community banks would likely need to hire  specialized third-party consultants and experts to perform the work.  Our members report that even  conservative estimates for an independent audit can exceed $100,000.  Because there are few  individuals and firms qualified to perform climate change scenario analysis, the demand for this service,  if mandatory for community banks, would only push the costs of these audits and exercises even higher.   Community banks cannot afford to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to third parties to perform  climate change scenario analyses, particularly if these analyses are evaluating immaterial or remote  climate-related financial risks or are unlikely to result in any measurable changes to business operations.    Since most community banks will be subject to CECL beginning in 2023, many of them will find it  necessary to stress test their loan portfolios to make accurate estimates of future losses under the new  accounting standard.  Further, community banks can test and validate their business continuity plans by  participating in FEMA’s National Exercise Program and the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation  Program.  Given that community bank portfolios are generally not as complex as large bank portfolios,  and because community banks already perform numerous stress testing exercises, community banks  simply do not need to perform yet another duplicative scenario analysis.      ICBA is also concerned mandatory scenario analysis could force community banks to engage in an  impossibly difficult exercise of forecasting for remote risks that may occur decades in the future, or  which may never transpire.  The longer the timeframes that are selected in scenario analysis for default  and loss projections, the more speculative and expensive the analysis becomes, while the utility of the  exercise, and the likelihood of any measurable changes to the business, are greatly reduced.    V.  Any Approach to Climate-related Financial Risk Management Must be Guided by Materiality    One of the biggest challenges community banks would face in incorporating the FDIC principles into  their risk management systems is anticipating, measuring, forecasting, and analyzing unknown and  unquantifiable risks.  As proposed, the FDIC principles are incredibly broad and lack specificity to help  banks and examiners identify material climate-related financial risks that could warrant heightened  scrutiny.  The FDIC principles do not contain any guardrails to ensure examiners cannot get carried away  in criticizing financially healthy banks on the basis of remote, or highly speculative, or immaterial  climate-related risks.       The FDIC principles also do not contain defining terms, detailed hypothetical or explanatory examples,  time periods for forecasting, or even specify a common data set banks should use to analyze climate  related financial risks.  ICBA is concerned that without any of these limits, the FDIC principles can  broadly apply to every type of physical risk or transition risk imaginable, no matter how immaterial or  remote, and banks could therefore be subject to undue regulatory scrutiny for minor deficiencies in 
Page 9 of 10    their risk management programs that are only tenuously related to climate-risk.  The resources and  costs that would be necessary to comply with the FDIC principles could quickly overwhelm a community  bank’s limited staff or force a community bank to de-risk entire industries or loan portfolios even if the  bank had no other safety and soundness weaknesses.    VI.  ICBA Recommendations     To the greatest extent possible, the FDIC should coordinate with other agencies and develop a  harmonized approach to climate change with the members of the FSOC, as well as the SBA,  FEMA, and USDA.  These agencies should adopt a flexible approach that acknowledges evolving  bank and supervisory practices as well as varying degrees of material climate-related financial  risks.     The FDIC should conduct outreach meetings with community banks to better understand why  climate risk principles that may be appropriate for large institutions are not appropriate for  community banks.     The FDIC should not apply the FDIC principles or any climate-related financial risk framework to  community banks with fewer than $100 billion in assets.     Before finalizing the FDIC principles or any additional guidance, the FDIC should conduct studies  jointly with the members of FSOC, as well as the SBA, FEMA, and USDA to understand whether  empirical data supports the conclusion that climate risks are a significant threat to the safety  and soundness of the financial system, and to determine whether a separate climate-related  financial risk management framework is necessary.     The FDIC should host voluntary climate risk exercises, similar to tech sprints, to facilitate an  open dialogue among government stakeholders, banks, insurers, vendors, and other third  parties and to identify whether a separate climate-related financial risk management framework  is necessary.     If the FDIC’s climate-related financial risk management framework is not intended to “choke- off” specific industries from the financial system, any future guidance should expressly inform  examiners there is no supervisory expectation that banks de-risk legal but climate disfavored  industries.     ICBA is supportive of some incentive-based solutions to address climate change.  For example,  the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) recently issued an industry letter  which describes the circumstances in which banking institutions subject to the New York  Community Reinvestment Act (“NY CRA”) may receive credit in connection with financing  projects addressing climate change, including credit for financing activities that reduce or  prevent the emission of greenhouse gases that cause climate change, and adapt to life in a  changing climate.  The NYDFS has stated banks may qualify for credit under the NY CRA for  community development lending or qualified investments that stabilize community  development such as investments in renewable energy and water conservation equipment to  reduce utility payments for low to moderate income (“LMI”) tenants, community solar projects,  microgrid or battery storage projects in LMI areas with high flood and/or wind risk, projects

While appreciating the focus on institutions with over $100 billion in assets, ICBA fears the principles could negatively impact small communities served by community banks and may eventually impose unnecessary regulatory burdens on them. ICBA criticizes the lack of empirical data supporting the FDIC's conclusions about climate risks and suggests the proposal might aim to exclude climate-disfavored industries from the financial system, reminiscent of ""Operation Chokepoint."" ICBA argues that community banks already manage climate-related risks effectively through existing practices and that mandatory scenario analysis would be costly and unnecessary. They recommend the FDIC coordinate with other agencies, conduct studies, and ensure any framework does not force banks to de-risk legal industries. ICBA supports incentive-based solutions for addressing climate change, such as those proposed by the New York Department of Financial Services, which offer credit for financing projects that mitigate climate impacts."

Sheesley Assistant Executive Secretary Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 550 17th Street NW Washington, DC 20429 RE: FDIC Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions Attention: Docket ID FDIC-2022-07065; RIN 3064-ZA32 To whom it may concern, The 14 undersigned organizations welcome the opportunity to comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC’s) Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions. We support this important step toward addressing climate risk in the banking system, and many of our organizations have also written in other comments to support strengthening the draft principles with respect to tailoring for banks of all sizes, ensuring robust climate scenario analysis, and aligning banks’ climate commitments with their internal strategies and governance. We write specifically here to urge the FDIC to carefully consider the potential impacts of climate supervisory guidance on racial, economic, environmental, and climate justice, and how these expectations will interact with fair lending principles and regulation and consumer financial protections. Prudential climate financial regulation is vital to protecting the banking system and the deposit insurance fund, and it must not result in additional burdens on vulnerable communities and households, the very consumers who are most at risk from climate impacts. To this end, it is critical that the FDIC expand its climate risk guidance to all banks in a way that recognizes the important role credit and banking services should play in helping vulnerable communities in building resilience to and mitigating climate disasters. Such guidance should include how banks can and should maintain the operational resilience of the critical services they provide. It should also encourage both large and small banks to support community investment in adaptation instead of withdrawing credit, to finance green investment, and to protect consumers from unsafe “green” financial products that lack adequate consumer protections and/or do not deliver purported climate benefits. The FDIC should also strengthen and finalize its recent proposal1 on Community Reinvestment Act regulations and guidance to address the impact of climate-related financial risks on LMI and communities of color, and harmonize these efforts. 1 ​FDIC, OCC, FRB, “Joint Proposal to Strengthen and Modernize Community Reinvestment Act Regulations,” 5 May 2022. https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22018.html
LMI communities, communities of color, and the banks that serve them are more vulnerable to physical risks from climate impacts. Decades of racist housing, lending, and siting policies–many created and perpetuated by the federal government itself–that denied households and communities of color equitable access to financial services have resulted in massive racial and economic disparities in wealth, climate vulnerability, environmental justice, and public health. These policies have segregated people of color and lower income households into neighborhoods that face not only higher levels of toxic pollution (e.g., from fossil fuel infrastructure) but also far greater physical vulnerability to climate impacts like flooding2 and extreme heat3 that harm infrastructure, public health, and local economies. In particular, EPA finds in an analysis of “socially vulnerable groups” that people of color are most likely to live in areas that will face the worst climate impacts. Black individuals are 40 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in mortality rates due to climate-driven changes in extreme temperatures. Hispanic and Latino individuals are 43 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected labor hour losses in weather-exposed industries. American Indian and Alaska Native individuals are 48 percent more likely to live in areas where the highest percentage of land is projected to be inundated due to sea level rise.4 The connection between redlining and climate vulnerability is clear; they co-exist in a feedback loop that further entrenches racial and economic inequality. In recent years, climate impacts–especially in underserved communities–are leading to ever-increasing annual direct damages,5 disruption to local economies based on agriculture, tourism, and energy,6 and sometimes ultimately emigration7 and loss of tax base,8 effectively bankrupting small towns across the country9 and destabilizing local financial institutions.10 Underserved communities 10 The Wall Street Journal, “Banks Take a Hit from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita,” 2005. https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112993899645076384 9 The NYTimes, “Climate Change is Bankrupting America’s Small Towns,” September 2021. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/climate/climate-towns-bankruptcy.html 8 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), “Climate Change and Long Term Fiscal Sustainability,” 2021. https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/scoping-paper-on-fiscal-sustainability-and-climate-change.pdf 7 The NYTimes and ProPublica, “The Great Climate Migration,” 2020. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html 6 U.S. Global Change Research Program, “Fourth National Climate Assessment -Volume II: Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States,” 2018. https://nca2018.globalchange.gov 5 NOAA, “Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters,” 2022. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/ 4 EPA, “Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States,” September 2021. ​https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/climate-vulnerability_september-2021_508.pdf 3 Hoffman et al., “The Effects of Historical Housing Policies on Resident Exposure to Intra-Urban Heat: A Study of 108 US Urban Areas,” 2020. https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm 2 See E.g., Redfin News, “A Racist Past, a Flooded Future: Formerly Redlined Areas Have $107 Billion Worth of Homes Facing High Flood Risk–25% More Than Non-Redlined Areas,” 2021. https://www.redfin.com/news/redlining-flood-risk/
tend to be both the most exposed to these damages and least able to access the federal aid resources to recover financially.11 In 2020, the National Advisory Council to FEMA troublingly found that “Many FEMA programs do not consider the principle of equity in financial assistance relief…Through the entire disaster cycle, communities that have been underserved stay underserved, and thereby suffer needlessly and unjustly.” In fact, research has shown that “holding disaster costs constant, the more [FEMA] money a county receives, the more whites’ wealth tends to grow, and the more blacks’ wealth tends to decline, all else equal. In other words, how federal assistance is currently administered seems to be exacerbating rather than ameliorating wealth inequalities that unfold after costly natural hazards.”12 As the stability of local banks is deeply linked to the economic fortunes of the communities and households that they serve, institutions that provide vital access to financial services for underserved communities face particular challenges due to climate change. Bank supervisors must be on the lookout not only for systemic risks that affect the largest banks and could lead to cascading losses to the deposit insurance fund, but also subsystemic safety and soundness issues that will affect certain geographies, sectors, and bank business models with elevated climate risk, as well as the risk that bank failures may pose to consumers through banking consolidation. Banks are chartered to serve the convenience and needs of their communities, so not only is their financial stability dependent on the economic stability of those communities, banks should be a driving force in ensuring that stability for all members of those communities. Supervision must encourage banks to enhance operational resilience and expand physical access to banking in LMI communities and communities of color. The FDIC should use supervision to ensure that banks remain operationally resilient in the face of climate-related disasters and that they offer financial services to underserved communities on an equitable basis. FDIC should extend and tailor its supervisory guidance to smaller institutions. Nearly all of the institutions supervised by the FDIC are smaller banks and savings associations.13 Some are more vulnerable to climate risk than larger banks due to the financial needs they meet and their more limited geographic range and product offerings, and they are also critically important for the financial health of rural and underserved communities. Banks must be prepared for increasingly common and severe disruptions due to climate-related disasters–such as wildfires or hurricanes–and chronic stressors like persistent flooding and extreme heat. Preparations should extend to electrical power, communications systems, and physical resilience of branches, servers, offices, and ATMs. Branch closings in increasingly 13 FDIC, “Supervision Program,” https://www.fdic.gov/about/strategic-plans/strategic/supervision.html 12 FEMA National Advisory Council, “National Advisory Council Report to the FEMA Administrator,” November 2020. https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_nac-report_11-2020.pdf; Howell and Elliott, “As Disaster Costs Rise, So Does Inequality,” Socius, 4 Dec 2018. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023118816795 11 Urban Institute, “Improving Disaster Recovery of Low-Income Families.” https://www.urban.org/debates/improving-disaster-recovery-low-income-families
climate vulnerable areas may be avoidable by investing in operational resilience. The FDIC should work in particular with smaller banks to disseminate policies and procedures that have worked to maintain resilience during previous disasters and encourage their implementation. Risk mitigation measures that rely on avoiding or raising rates in climate vulnerable areas will have disparate impacts on LMI communities and communities of color. In an effort to remain safe and sound, it is critical that larger, more diversified banks do not retreat from climate vulnerable communities, but instead find ways to promote climate resilience for their customers and communities. “Bluelining” is a developing practice where financial institutions identify areas as having higher environmental risk and avoid offering loans and banking services, or raise costs in those areas.14 Seemingly risk-based analysis will recreate the same boundaries as previous redlining decisions that create and perpetuate racial and economic inequality. Such practices are particularly harmful to underserved communities that often lack ready access to credit at fair rates to rebuild. The FDIC draft principles contain only a brief mention of the potential fair lending risk that may be associated with these harmful mitigation practices under the category of legal/compliance risk. To avoid disparate impacts of the guidance, FDIC must place greater emphasis on fair lending risk–it should be an essential component of all aspects of the climate risk management that banks do–especially given the troubling history of discriminatory policies and practices that have led to climate vulnerability for underserved communities. As part of the guidance, FDIC should provide examples of climate risk mitigation strategies that pose potential fair lending risk exposure for banks, including with respect to potential revised CRA guidelines which penalize bank investments that exacerbate racialized climate harms.15 Further, FDIC should collect data to determine how prevalent climate-induced curtailing of financial services has become for LMI communities and communities of color. As part of this guidance, it should also require that banks identify, measure, monitor, and address potential and occurring disproportionate impacts on communities of color and LMI communities. Banks should have a system for tracking their actions to avoid or address disproportionate impacts and documenting their progress on addressing those impacts. FDIC should also provide clear supervisory expectations and work with banks to manage climate-related risks in ways that do not create disparate impact on underserved communities. There are methods available that serve the same purpose without discriminatory effect. For instance, the FDIC could encourage banks to invest more in other resilience measures, such as divesting from assets exposed to a high degree of transition risk, or provide more low-cost funding for climate mitigation and adaptation measures in vulnerable communities. This guidance should be consistent with expected CRA reform that expands the definition to “community development” to include climate resilience and green investments. 15 Cite CRA proposal 14 Abraham Lustgarten, “How the Climate Crisis Will Shape Migration in America,” The NYTimes, 15 Sept 2021.
The FDIC should work also with other government agencies to examine banks’ needs and other federal climate and disaster resilience resources to deal with climate risk that can be deployed to lessen climate vulnerability and deter banks retreating from the communities and households that most need access to financial services to prepare for and recover from climate-related disasters. Special attention and resources should be provided to small CDFIs with strong track records of serving underserved communities, MDIs, and institutions that cannot easily diversify. The FDIC should encourage safe and fair lending strategies to improve the climate resilience of communities and households the institutions it regulates serve, and discourage predatory products marketed with a “green” label. Acceptable climate-risk mitigation can include lending strategies that promote climate resilience, including the development of climate resilient affordable housing, schools, and businesses; clean electricity projects and microgrids; nature-based protective infrastructure (“green infrastructure”); building decarbonization, which includes holistic home weatherization and health interventions; electric public transit and electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and lending to green small businesses and corporations with legitimate decarbonization transition strategies. For smaller community-based banks, investments in weatherization and climate resilience for local businesses can improve the financial health of the community and promote safety and soundness. Climate-risk mitigation measures generally should be developed in a way that ensures accessibility and affordability in LMI communities and communities of color, and which promotes bonafide wealth building opportunities in these communities. Unfortunately, many community banks have noted that the novelty of these climate-resilient asset classes creates regulatory uncertainty, chilling lending. The FDIC should prioritize providing guidance on green lending for underserved communities, which will help small banks deploy capital in socially productive ways. To do this, the FDIC can survey what has worked for smaller banks, or even green banks, who have successfully underwritten such loans, and transmit the specific policies and procedures that could be put in place to underwrite green loans in novel markets. Such guidance will provide confidence to smaller banks in moving forward on these kinds of loans. At the same time, the guidance should recognize where “green” financial products have not been good for consumers, and steer banks away from those products. For example, residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loans offer the often over-inflated promise of electricity bill savings through energy efficiency or renewable energy upgrades, but most programs do not fully assess the borrower's ability to repay. The borrower’s home serves as collateral for PACE financing with payments collected through the local property tax system. Failure to pay can leave the homeowner vulnerable to tax foreclosure. And as with the subprime lending abuses that led to the financial crisis of a decade ago, residential PACE loans frequently target the most economically vulnerable borrowers–low-income families, the elderly, and borrowers of color–many of whom may be eligible for grants or low cost loans to address energy efficiency and for whom PACE loans may be an unaffordable and risky product. Residential
PACE lending has become an urgent problem in low-income communities and communities of color where the product is actively sold using aggressive sales tactics and homeowners are often pressured to sign up without an actual assessment of home needs or suitability. The FDIC must caution banks away from propagating this product, as well as others like it. The FDIC should also ensure that any novel approaches to housing finance intended to promote energy efficiency retrofits and upgrades do not feature the unintended consequences of assumed savings or increased property values and, as a result, place consumers in loans they cannot afford or loans that are not justified by the subsequent energy savings. We thank the FDIC for moving forward with supervisory guidance to mitigate climate risk within the banking system, and we urge your consideration of fair lending implications and incorporation of appropriate equity safeguards within the supervision and examination process.

173,kzh-hv7s-xn9o,"Comptroller Hsu, I am very concerned about climate change and the lack of effort by our financial institutions to face this threat honestly and responsibly, and I thank you for this draft guidance. It outlines a framework for robust assessment, disclosure, and risk management that will force banks to reckon with climate change risk. I urge you to resist all efforts to dilute this guidance and to follow up with scope and details as broad as OCC’s authority allows. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change–a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance recommendations to banks that they incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business, plan for climate change over a long time horizon and update models as additional data becomes available, develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting limits, and make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interests of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. We have less than a decade to slow down the pace of global warming so that we do not push the planet past a point of no return.  Every new fossil fuel project makes it that much harder to slow the pace of change.  THE URGENCY IS REAL AND LARGELY UNDERSTATED BY BOTH GOVERNMENTS AND THE MEDIA.  The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment expresses strong concern about climate change and criticizes financial institutions for insufficiently addressing climate risks. The commenter supports the draft guidance by Comptroller Hsu, which proposes a framework for banks to assess, disclose, and manage climate risks.

The comment highlights the contradiction between banks' public commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and their continued investments in fossil fuels, which exacerbate climate change and disproportionately affect marginalized communities. The commenter advocates for integrating climate risk management into all business levels, aligning internal strategies with public commitments, and factoring climate risk into supervisory ratings.

As a physician I am deeply concerned about the effects of fossil fuel extraction and usage on the health of Americans...especially the disenfranchized.  We have overwhelming scientific proof of harm, yet industry denies it and banks (and the government) continue to subsidize the harm.  Furthermore, there is no accountability to clean up their mess.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comments on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am President and CEO of Claremont Savings  Bank, a $500 million mutual bank with offices in western New Hampshire and eastern Vermont.  I think  the efforts of the FDIC to focus on ""climate risk"" are inappropriate and beyond its mandate. It will  require banks to produce meaningless information that will provide no benefit to the bank or the  regulators. We already do a good job of considering risks to our borrowers and the institution.  It  appears that the goal is not to address risk management but to prod banks not to fund companies in  unfavored sectors. In the Northeast, we are dependent of fuel oil for heating most of our homes and gas  for heating and electricity. We are already having issues with energy prices as pipeline construction is  stalled and too much renewable energy is added to the grid. Continued increases in prices will hurt our  consumers, local businesses and the overall economy.  This seems to be a political campaign by the FDIC  and other federal entities and will be viewed as such by most of the regulated entities. If the  administration changes, there would be a reversal. It is not healthy for us to have what should be stable  risk management guidance whipsawed back and forth depending on the administration in power.  I  know this policy change is intended for the larger banks, but their risk is not climate risk. It is the risk of  falling out of favor with the regulators. We need those banks to support our energy sector, or we will all  suffer.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment. It is frustrating to see our regulators take political  positions.    Sincerely,    Reginald Greene   Claremont, NH","Reginald Greene, President and CEO of Claremont Savings Bank, criticizes the FDIC's focus on climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions, arguing it is beyond the FDIC's mandate and will produce unnecessary information. He believes the initiative is politically motivated, aiming to discourage banks from funding certain sectors, particularly energy, which is crucial in the Northeast. Greene highlights existing energy price issues due to stalled pipeline construction and increased renewable energy, warning that further price hikes will harm consumers and the economy. He expresses concern that such policies could change with different administrations, leading to instability in risk management guidance. Greene emphasizes the need for banks to support the energy sector to avoid economic suffering."
278,kzn-7yd2-qh8v,"February 14, 2022 Via Electronic Submission Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, D.C. 20219 RE: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks The American Council on Renewable Energy (“ACORE”) respectfully submits these comments in response to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”)’s request for feedback on the draft “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.” ACORE is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable energy sector through market development, policy changes and financial innovation. ACORE’s membership includes renewable energy developers, institutional investors, corporate buyers, electric power generators, retail energy providers, and other stakeholders interested in finding and implementing best practices for sustainability disclosures and climate-related financial risk assessments.1 The OCC’s draft principles take the right approach by offering a principles-based framework for how large banks manage climate risk. The OCC should coordinate with other bank regulators, both domestically and internationally, to avoid conflicting or duplicative supervisory expectations to the extent possible. By promoting a principles-based framework, coordinating with other U.S. bank regulators and considering international frameworks, we believe the OCC will be able to effectively support banks in building their capabilities to effectively manage climate-related financial risk. Our comments below are specifically targeted at the OCC’s questions on climate-related financial products or services that banks offer to clients and customers. In response to question eight, “What, if any, climate-related financial products or services – for example, ‘green bonds,’ derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account – do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose?” Large U.S. banks provided a vast majority of renewable energy tax equity in support of the U.S. renewable energy development in the past twenty years, mostly investing through banking holding companies under merchant banking authority. Banks are projected to provide a majority 1 The views expressed are those of the American Council on Renewable Energy and do not necessarily reflect the views of any individual ACORE member company. 1
of tax equity in the coming years in support of clean energy transition. Tax equity transactions generally meet the requirement as recently codified in 12 C.F.R. § 7.1025, and with the further guidance issued in OCC Bulletin 2021-15, more banks are expected to invest tax equity through their bank entities. In addition to the environmental benefits, these investments compare favorably to other banking products in risk and return profiles. OCC should further encourage such investments by designating renewable energy tax equity investments as public welfare investments, analogous to low-income housing tax credit investments, which will provide consistent regulatory capital framework for the types of ESG investments that OCC and other regulatory bodies aim to support. Many banks are offering sustainable finance and other climate-related financial products and services that can direct funding to renewable energy.2 BloombergNEF has outlined many of these options in a 2021 report; chief among them are sustainable financing product options and client services that assist in the transition to green portfolios. Banks deploy a variety of sustainable debt options across the spectrum of green bonds, green loans, social bonds, sustainability bonds, sustainability linked bonds, sustainability linked loans and transition-bonds.3 As the energy transition accelerates, banks are stepping up the issuance of these products and increasing the underwriting of sustainable debt for renewable energy firms. For example, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole underwrote $17.7 billion and $15.1 billion in green and sustainability bonds last year, respectively. JP Morgan was the largest green and sustainability bond underwriter in 2020, with $17.7 billion issued.4 Many banks disclose impact reports on issued bonds reviewed by third-party opinion providers and may attach metrics to their sustainability-linked bonds and transition bonds, such as an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) score to increase transparency to investors. Green bonds can also be linked to specific environmental targets, such as an increase in the share of renewable energy generation and consumption to enhance their climate impact. Banks can also create ESG-related derivatives products, including renewable energy purchasing instruments such as power purchase agreements (“PPAs”), proxy revenue swaps, renewable energy certificates (“RECs”), wind index futures, renewable identification numbers (“RINs”) futures and low-carbon fuel standard futures. These efforts enhance liquidity and deployment of green investment. 2 “Transition bonds” finance projects that are considered as interim steps toward a low-carbon economy, such as the development of a gas power plant in place of coal, which may still retain climate risks.

Client services may include development of climate transition plans,5 clean technology advisory services,6 carbon trading services,7 and facilitating liquidity across environmental markets and risk management strategies.8 And finally, banks can support renewable energy sector mergers and acquisitions. ACORE supports the OCC’s efforts to articulate a framework for how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate, and appreciates the OCC’s interest in how banks are offering climate-related financial products or services to clients and customers as the energy transition accelerates.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    The reason I am writing is regarding the FDIC's Request for Comment on its state of principles for  climate-related financial risk for Large Financial Institutions. I am the Chief Credit Officer of Legence  Bank, a $650million asset bank headquartered in Eldorado IL. We serve 12 communities in Southern  Illinois and 1 in Evansville Indiana. As a community bank, we are focused on ensuring the needs of the  areas we are in are met. We are also in a heavily agricultural area.  Everything I have read and heard, the  proposed regulatory changes are targeted on banks with assets exceeding $100billion. But, I have also  been advise the FDIC is focused on climate change as a ""systemic issue in the banking industry"". My first  comment is this: additional regulatory scrutiny in the industry will put an undue burden on community  banks. We are faced with enough challenges to just find adequate loans with sufficient credit quality to  lend to in this rising rate environment. Additionally the ""costs for compliance"" today are becoming  exorbitant. Measuring the potential impacts of climate change on a community bank and its customers  goes well beyond the abilities and capabilities of community bankers. For the past 50 years the  ""experts"" have been predicting and analyzing climate change with the question of ""to what avail""? The  predictions these experts made have failed to come to fruition as predicted. How, then, are bankers able  to assess changes? We do not employ meteorologists on our staff, nor can we afford to. We need to  focus our efforts on what we do every day: serve the needs of our communities and our customers in  them.  Personally, I think the effort to have any bank, regardless of size, to measure this climate-related  impact goes too far. But for banks that are MUCH smaller it poses an undue hardship. I look at Legence  Bank for a moment. We have a large agriculture portfolio. We work with customers across several  counties. We bank large operations that farm 6,000 acres and some that farm 600. We discuss crop  insurance coverage; we analyze secondary repayment sources; we make sure we have hazard insurance  in place on structures (and we have purchased blanket insurance for smaller loans); we know our  customers. Our lenders attend seminars and learn from experts on not only the local agriculture  economy, but national and international. We understand that weather patterns change. Some years are  normal; some are dry; some are wet. We discuss marketing opportunities with our farm customers. We  are diverse too. We don't lend internationally. We work with our farm customers to utilize FSA guaranty  programs as appropriate to mitigate risks. In short, we do not pose a risk to the Banking industry. We  are family-owned for the majority. We are seeking to be a part of our communities for the long-haul.  However, forcing added burdens only seeks to lessen that option.  I implore the FDIC to reconsider its  efforts and, if this change must be implemented, wholly exempt banks that are like us.      Mr. Alan Jones   Evansville, IN","Mr. Alan Jones, Chief Credit Officer of Legence Bank, expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk regulations for large financial institutions. He argues that these regulations, although targeted at banks with assets over $100 billion, could impose undue burdens on smaller community banks like Legence Bank, which has $650 million in assets. Jones highlights the challenges community banks face, such as finding adequate loans and managing rising compliance costs. He questions the feasibility of community banks assessing climate change impacts without the resources of larger institutions. Jones emphasizes that Legence Bank, serving agricultural communities, already manages various risks and does not pose a systemic risk to the banking industry. He urges the FDIC to reconsider or exempt smaller banks from these regulations, as they could hinder their ability to serve local communities effectively."

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am sending this correspondence in response to the FDIC's request for on its statement of principles of  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am a Community President of  First Option Bank located in communities surrounding the Kansas City Metro in Kansas and Missouri.  Most of our banks are in communities of less than 6000 people. We are a $600 Million community bank  providing home loans, small business and commercial loans, consumer loans and agriculture loans. In  several of the communities we are the most active lender remaining with a full service bank. After  reading what you have proposed, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate- risk management to banks like ours, a small community bank. This proposed framework would  negatively impact my communities. Community Banks with any exposure to agriculture have always  been impacted by climate-related risks. We've always accounted for those issues. Community Banks do  not pose a systemic risk to the financial system and a 'one size fits all' framework that is designed for  large complex institutions that do not know their clients well, or who do not live in the areas where  climate impacts occur regularly, could seriously affect our institution and the communities we serve.  Dealing with the costs and complexity of compliance as it currently is, and add something of this  magnitude, and I feel the expense would be insurmountable and unnecessarily duplicate our current risk  management practices. Weather has always played a role in our current practices when assessing loan  loss provisions and credit management. Living in Kansas or Missouri, severe weather has always played a  part in our daily lives. Bankers in the Midwest have always rallied to support their communities when  tornados or other severe weather incidents occur. With the adoption of CECL, we're already assessing  risks such as climate, with the booking of each loan. This proposed regulation would create additional  response and costs to what we're already doing. I personally thank you for limiting the proposal  currently to banks over the $100 billion in asset threshold and I strongly encourage the FDIC to conduct  outreach with community bankers to understand why this proposal should never trickle down to  community banks.    Chad Lewis   First Option Bank Community President   Spring Hill, KS","Chad Lewis, Community President of First Option Bank, expresses concern over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework, fearing it may eventually apply to small community banks like his. He argues that such a framework, designed for large institutions, could negatively impact small banks and their communities, particularly those with agricultural exposure. Lewis emphasizes that community banks already account for climate-related risks and do not pose systemic risks to the financial system. He highlights the potential financial burden and redundancy of compliance with the proposed framework, given existing risk management practices. Lewis appreciates the current limitation of the proposal to banks with over $100 billion in assets and urges the FDIC to engage with community bankers to prevent the framework from affecting smaller banks."

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to comment on your notice of proposed policy  statement on Statement of Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk Management for  Large Financial Institutions.    You are requesting comment on draft principles that would provide a high-level framework for  the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks. Although all  financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related  financial risks, these draft principles are targeted at the largest financial institutions, those  with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The draft principles are intended to  support efforts by large financial institutions to focus on key aspects of climate-related  financial risk management.    I agree with you that: “Climate-related financial risks pose a clear and significant risk to the  U.S. financial system and, if unmitigated, may pose a near-term threat to safe and sound  banking and financial stability. Weaknesses in how institutions identify, measure, monitor,  and control the physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could  adversely affect a financial institution’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial  system.”1 While measurement, assessment and quantification of climate-related risks is still a  growing area, the minimum expectation for financial institutions is that they should have in  place the appropriate focus and governance covering the overall topic.

We appreciate that the FDIC and OCC propose to rely on a principles-based approach to  managing this risk, one that leverages existing risk management and supervisory  processes.  The principles provide sufficient flexibility both to tailor risk management to  the risks of individual institutions as well as to the evolving state of climate change risk  and the evolving state of the assessment of that risk. We also appreciate that the FDIC  and OCC have coordinated their approaches to climate-related financial risk  management.  In further response to the FDIC’s request for feedback, we attach and incorporate by  reference MBA’s feedback on the OCC Statement of Principles. Because the FDIC  Statement of Principles is substantively similar to those put forth by the OCC, we believe  our feedback to the OCC is equally applicable here.

      February 14, 2022  The Honorable Michael J. Hsu  Acting Comptroller of the Currency   Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  400 7th Street SW  Washington, DC 20219  RE:  MBA Feedback on Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Banks  Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu:  The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)1 appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Office  of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) invitation to provide feedback on its draft Principles  for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (hereinafter “Draft Principles”).2   MBA is the national association representing the real state finance industry, including banks with  over $100 billion in consolidated assets. Our response, therefore, reflects a focus on the mortgage  lending and servicing activities of covered banks, including commercial, multifamily, and single- family mortgage lending and servicing. Specifically, we are focused on the impact of climate- related events that could result in increases in the credit risk associated with mortgages – and  how these risks are managed.   I.  OVERVIEW  The OCC issued the Draft Principles to address its concern that banks’ exposure to climate- related financial risks could affect the safety and soundness of banks and the overall financial  system.   From the perspective of mortgage lending and servicing, MBA agrees with the general principle  that climate-related impacts to credit risk can be analyzed across various dimensions, including  sectoral and geographic, to assess both current and possible future credit risk exposure from  physical and transition risks, including concentrations of risk.    1 The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) is the national association representing the real estate finance  industry, an industry that employs more than 390,000 people in virtually every community in the country.

  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 2  MBA also appreciates that the OCC is considering a principles-based rather than prescriptive  approach, and is focused on leveraging existing risk management frameworks rather than calling  for an entirely new framework. We urge the OCC to encourage other supervisors to adopt a similar  approach, and we also urge supervisors to recognize that this an evolving area with an evolving  understanding of the risks.  With respect to scenario analysis, we support the OCC’s distinction between climate scenario  analysis and regulatory stress testing and urge the OCC to recognize the exploratory nature of  scenario analysis given the limited availability and nascent state of methodologies and models.  Relatedly, the OCC should recognize that time horizons that may be appropriate for any particular  scenario analysis will be a function of the purpose of each analysis, the context of the analysis,  and possibly the availability of data.  II.  THE PROPOSED PRINCIPLES  The Draft Principles arise from the OCC’s concern that “[w]eaknesses in how banks identify,  measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a  changing climate could adversely affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall  financial system.” The OCC describes those physical and transition risks as follows:  Physical risks refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute, climate- related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, and chronic  shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation  patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.   Transition risks refer to stresses to certain banks or sectors arising from the shifts  in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the  changes necessary to limit climate change.3  The OCC’s Draft Principles address those concerns by providing a high-level framework for the  safe and sound management of climate-related financial risks by large banks, “consistent with the  existing risk management framework described in existing OCC rules and guidance.”4 That  framework includes general principles for:   •  Governance;   •  Policies, procedures, and limits;   •  Strategic planning;  •  Risk management;   •  Data, risk measurement, and reporting; and   •  Scenario analysis.   The Draft Principles also apply those general principles across the established risk areas of credit  risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal/compliance risk, and other financial and non-financial risk.   Following its consideration of feedback on the Draft Principles as well as lessons learned and  best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions, the OCC plans to issue guidance that    3 Draft Principles at p. 1.  4 Id.  
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 3  would address the respective roles and responsibilities of boards of directors and management  and, consistent with the OCC’s risk-based approach to supervision, “appropriately tailor any  resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as  complexity of operations and business models.”5 A similar approach may be adopted by other  supervisors that oversee smaller banks, credit unions, independent mortgage banks, and other  institutions in the mortgage industry, in a manner commensurate with their exposures to climate- related financial risk.   III.  CLIMATE CHANGE, CREDIT RISK, AND MORTGAGES  The Draft Principles describe the OCC’s climate-related expectations around credit risk as follows:  Credit Risk. The board and management should consider climate-related financial  risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios. Effective  credit risk management practices could include monitoring climate-related credit  risks through sectoral, geographic, and single-name concentration analyses,  including credit risk concentrations stemming from physical and transition risks. As  part of concentration risk analysis, management should assess potential changes  in correlations across exposures or asset classes. The board and management  should determine credit risk appetite and lending limits related to these risks.6   This discussion of credit risk in the Draft Principles is of interest to MBA and its members who are  engaged in mortgage finance. The impacts of climate-related physical and transition risks to  mortgages are likely to be experienced principally in the form of credit risk.7 Acute climate-related  events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, heatwaves, and chronic shifts in climate, including  higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean  acidification that result in damage to property securing a mortgage can result in unexpected costs  to borrowers or losses to income, and can reduce the value of the property, all of which increase  credit risk. Shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the  changes necessary to limit climate change can have similar impacts that also could increase  credit risk.  The general principle that climate-related impacts to credit risk can be analyzed across various  dimensions, including sectoral and geographic, to assess both current and possible future credit  risk exposure from physical and transition risks, including concentrations of risk, is reasonable as  applied to mortgage credit risk. To the extent that identified climate-related credit risk is material,    5 Id. at p. 2.  6 Id. at p. 4.  7 Any increased mortgage default risk due to climate-related events could interact with liquidity risk for  loans that are securitized, as well. Depending on the nature of the securitization, banks may be  contractually required to advance payments to investors, even if borrowers fail to make these payments.  Most of the current mortgage securitization market is comprised of loans and securities that include  insurance or guarantees from government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises. As such,  advanced payments typically are reimbursed by the relevant insurer or guarantor, though the entity  servicing these loans needs sufficient liquidity to make advances until reimbursement occurs. The  experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which millions of borrowers across the country exercised  forbearance and skipped payments, showed that banks were well-equipped to meet these short-term  liquidity demands. 
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 4  it would be reasonable for those risks to be reflected in applicable elements of a bank’s risk  appetite.  We note that geography inherently is a key factor when assessing the risk of a loan secured by  real property. Improvements over time in key tools, such as flood- or wildfire-risk maps and  models, should foster improvements in the quality of such assessments. Assessing chronic  physical risks, or transition risks such as those arising from changes in building emission  standards or changes in consumer taste, will be more challenging.8 While there may be a  geographic dimension to such risks, it may be more challenging to project appropriately stressful  and plausible scenarios as to where or how such transition risk events could unfold.   IV.  MBA FEEDBACK    In response to the OCC’s invitation, MBA respectfully provides feedback below on the overall  approach taken in the Draft Principles, scenario analysis, time horizons, and impacts on  households and communities.   A.  Overall approach  We appreciate the overall approach to climate-related financial risk reflected in the Draft  Principles. Climate-related financial risk is a long-standing risk factor that is likely growing more  acute and is, therefore, subject to increased attention and analysis. The collective  understanding of this risk, however, remains in its relative infancy. The OCC’s principles-based  approach is, therefore, welcome and preferable to a more prescriptive approach.  In the Draft Principles, the OCC also recognizes that addressing climate-related financial risk will  require banks to leverage and enhance their existing risk-management frameworks – and not  establish independent new frameworks for addressing this risk. While climate-related financial  risk is not fully understood, it is important to recognize that banks do not face that risk unarmed.  Consistent with its approach of leveraging existing risk-management frameworks, the Draft  Principles also do not treat emerging climate-related financial risk as a separate, new category of  risk. Rather, the Draft Principles recognize that climate change is a financial risk driver that may  manifest itself in impacts on established areas of risk: credit risk, liquidity risk, other financial risk,  operational risk, legal/compliance risk, and other non-financial risk.  We note that these elements of the OCC’s approach are consistent with the approaches across  prudential regulators described in a recent Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) report on  climate-related financial risk:9     8 A recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff report shares this view as to the relative challenge of  the different elements of climate change credit risk. See Blickle et al., How Bad Are Weather Disasters for  Banks?, NY Fed. Staff Report, p. 3 (Nov. 2021, rev. Jan. 2022) (“Our findings suggest that the acute,  physical risks to banks are not first-order. Banks’ resilience against such risks should reinforce the financial  system more broadly. More chronic physical risks and transition risks may warrant more focus.” (citation  omitted)); available at sr990.pdf (newyorkfed.org)  9 See FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, pp. 27-32 Oct. 21, 2021; available at  https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf.  
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 5  Regulators and supervisors of depository institutions—the FDIC, FRB, OCC,  NCUA, and state banking supervisors (depository institution regulators)—expect  supervised institutions to manage all material risks and undertake steps to operate  in compliance with laws and regulations and in a safe and sound manner. As noted  previously, climate-related financial risks may manifest through traditional  prudential risk categories that are supervised under safety and soundness  mandates.   As part of their supervisory activities, the depository institution regulators expect  to review within traditional prudential risk categories, as relevant, how effectively  institutions incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management  systems and frameworks, appropriate to their size, complexity, risk profile, and  location.10  These elements of the Draft Principles effectively put banks on notice that the OCC expects them  to be actively engaged in incorporating climate change risks into their existing risk-management  processes. In addition, they also provide room for banks to have the flexibility needed to continue  to develop approaches to identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and  transition risks associated with a changing climate that are tailored to their respective institutions.   For these reasons, we urge the OCC to continue the high-level, principles-based approach  towards managing climate-change risk facing OCC-supervised banks and to work with other  prudential supervisors to encourage them to adopt an aligned approach to their supervision of  financial institutions’ management of climate-related financial risk.    We also urge the OCC to appropriately temper its expectations by balancing its intent to increase  banks’ efforts in the area of climate-related financial risk with the recognition that this an evolving  area and, as such, banks are at the early stages of learning to assess and understand the nature  of the associated risks. With such a balance, we urge the OCC to facilitate progress in banks’  efforts to integrate climate-related financial risk into their existing risk-management frameworks  by engaging in constructive dialogue at different stages with banks and sharing information on  applicable risk-management best practices. The Draft Principles may provide an appropriate  foundation for such initial constructive dialogue.  B.  Scenario analysis    One of the Draft Principles is that climate-related scenario analysis is emerging as an important  approach for identifying, measuring, and managing climate-related risks.11 As the OCC describes,  climate scenario analysis is a forward-looking assessment of the potential impact on a bank of  changes resulting from climate-related risks. In contrast to traditional regulatory stress tests,  climate-related scenario analyses may address a longer time horizon and explore various “what  if” paths rather than near-term changes to economic or financial conditions.     10 Id. at pp. 27-28.  11 Draft Principles at p. 4. 
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 6  We appreciate that the discussion of scenario analysis in the Draft Principles provides a  framework of expectations without specifying prescriptive requirements for any particular type of  scenario analysis.   •  Scenario analysis can be applied alongside existing risk management practices;  •  Climate-related scenario analysis frameworks should be commensurate to the bank’s size,  complexity, business activity, and risk profile;  •  Scenarios should include clearly defined objectives that reflect the bank’s overall climate  risk management strategies, which could include identifying and measuring vulnerability  to relevant climate-related risk factors, including physical and transition risks, and  estimating climate-related exposures and potential losses across a range of plausible  scenarios;  •  Climate-related scenario analyses should be subject to oversight, validation, and quality  control standards that would be commensurate to their risk; and   •  Climate-related scenario analysis results should be clearly and regularly communicated  to all relevant individuals within the bank, including an appropriate level of information  necessary to effectively convey the assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty of results.  This element of the Draft Principles might also usefully include recognition of the relative  immaturity of underlying data and methodologies. Many data providers, for example, are still in  the process of developing and expanding on datasets that banks can integrate into their  scenarios. As a result, banks may reasonably employ data assumptions or approximations to  analyze the impacts of some scenarios.   Consistent with the approach taken under Other Financial Risk, it would be useful to recognize  that banks necessarily will work with the methodologies and data that are reasonably available  and refine them over time.12 This particularly will be the case in scenario analyses designed to  assess exposure to transition risk – for example, arising from future changes to building emission  standards or changes in consumer tastes that could affect mortgage credit risk. We recognize, of  course, that the assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty of results with respect to any scenario  analyses should be documented and provided along with any communication of results, so that  decisionmakers can gauge the level of reliance they can reasonably place on those results.     12 See id. at p. 5 (Under heading Other Financial Risk: “While market participants are still researching how  to measure climate price risk, the board and management should use the best measurement methodologies  reasonably available to them and refine them over time.”). 
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 7  C.  Time horizons  The Draft Principles raise the question of the appropriate time horizons for risk assessment both  in the context of determining when a climate-related financial risk is material13 and specifically in  the context of the discussion of scenario analysis.14   This raises the question of whether there may be any preferred time horizons that banks will be  expected to apply. There can be no single answer to that question. Time horizons can vary with  the specific purpose of the scenario analysis. A scenario analysis used to assess the risk of a  bank’s current mortgage portfolio, for example, may employ a time horizon that correlates with  the expected durations of the mortgages in that portfolio. A scenario analysis for the purpose of  assessing the risks of a bank’s business strategies, in contrast, may employ a much longer time  horizon. In effect, the appropriate time horizon will be affected by the purpose of the analysis, the  context of the analysis, and possibly by the availability of data. Longer time horizons, of course,  also mean greater uncertainty as to the results.  * * *  MBA appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on the OCC’s principles and vision for large  bank management of climate-related financial risks. This is an important and emerging area of  risk that warrants attention. We urge the OCC to continue to rely largely on a principles-based  approach to managing this risk, one that leverages existing risk management and supervisory  processes, and that also provides sufficient flexibility both to tailor risk management to the risks  of individual institutions as well as to the evolving state of climate change risk and the evolving  state of the assessment of that risk.

The MBA appreciates the principles-based approach, which aligns with existing risk management frameworks and offers flexibility to tailor risk management to individual institutions and evolving climate risks. The MBA emphasizes the importance of managing climate-related credit risks in mortgage lending, highlighting the potential impact of climate events on credit risk. They support the coordination between FDIC and OCC and suggest that the principles should not create new frameworks but enhance existing ones. The MBA also discusses the importance of scenario analysis, urging the recognition of the exploratory nature of such analyses due to limited data and methodologies. They advocate for a balanced approach, acknowledging the evolving understanding of climate risks, and encourage constructive dialogue and sharing of best practices. The MBA's feedback to the OCC is considered applicable to the FDIC's principles, emphasizing a consistent approach across regulatory bodies."

Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, as stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
People have been advised to save for future emergencies, but banks have not awarded us significant interest rates. We don't have enough money to address the emergencies that extreme weather and climate change create. It is criminal that they simultaneously invest our money in those very industries that are exacerbating these economic catastrophes. NOAA statistics show that climate disasters have cost us over $2 trillion since 1980.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am the Senior Lending Officer of a $185MM  community bank located in SE MN. We are based in Preston, MN and are the only bank with a physical  location serving that city. We also have branches in Chatfield and Rochester, MN. Close to half our loan  volume is to farmers in rural areas in SE MN and we also serve small business in those areas and in  Rochester.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this proposed framework for  managing climate-related financial risk management for large banks to community banks which will  negatively impact the communities we serve.  I believe there should be separate risk policies for  community bank $100B or less. Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose systemic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management framework designed for large, complex institutions. Compliance under the proposed  regulations would be expensive (finding and hiring qualified people in this field) and unnecessary (as a  community and ag bank we are fully aware of how the environment is affected by our customers and  work with them to implement environmentally safe programs to their operations).  Thank you for the  opportunity to submit comments on the proposed framework and for limiting its proposal to banks with  more than $100 billion in assets. I encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to  better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.    Respectfully,    James Oeltjenbruns   Rochester, MN","James Oeltjenbruns, a Senior Lending Officer at a community bank in Southeast Minnesota, expresses concerns about the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework. He argues that applying this framework to community banks, like his, would negatively impact the communities they serve. Oeltjenbruns emphasizes that community banks, which typically have assets of $100 billion or less, do not pose systemic risks to the financial system and should not be subject to regulations designed for larger institutions. He highlights the potential high costs and unnecessary nature of compliance for community banks, which already work closely with customers on environmentally safe practices. Oeltjenbruns urges the FDIC to maintain the proposal's focus on larger banks and to engage with community bankers to understand their unique challenges and perspectives."

I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change/chaos/collapse over a short, and medium time horizon,(there is no long time horizon for humans if we don't end fossil fuel use immediately though) and update models as additional data becomes available; Runaway warming has already begun.
Develop clear definitions of climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for ending fossil fuels this year(now) and switching to electric vehicles, and wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro power sources. Or there will not be a functioning civilization to do any banking for in maybe 10 years, possibly less.
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. And elimination of the ""wealth gap"". The increasing poverty and homelessness problem in America is a direct result of capitalism and the growing wealth gap. More money needs to be going to mental health care facilities and education. Most homeless people are ""crazy"" and should be in a care facility somewhere, not left on the streets. And the other ""sane"" homeless people need help with work, not simply fired from every job due to extreme competition and greed by the people at the top obsessed with hoarding wealth.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate/death risk.

   One important facet of this whole issue is banking support for both innovation and employment of existing renewable energy applications, and not focusing solely on withdrawing funding from new and existing fossil fuel projects.  It's time to get on the right side of history.  LOTS of people are not forgetting how misguided, shortsighted, and opportunistic banking practices contributed to or caused the 2008 financial debacle that was solved by the government using taxpayer money to bail out failing banks.  That kind of business practice builds cynicism and distrust rather than faith in the capitalist system.","The comment addresses Comptroller Hsu, expressing gratitude for addressing climate change in banking.

298,kzn-faiv-8qrb,"February 14, 2022 Chief Counsel’s Office Attention: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Submitted via https://www.regulations.gov Re: Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, Docket ID OCC-2021-0023, OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021) Dear Sir/Madam: On behalf of the undersigned, we respectfully submit the following comments in response to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”)’s request for feedback regarding Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (“Proposed Principles”).1 We request that the OCC not adopt the Proposed Principles. First, the OCC’s Proposed Principles single out climate-related risk alone for special treatment, despite more serious threats that include economic downturns, foreign wars, and public health crises. We disagree that climate-related financial risk is the single gravest threat to the U.S. banking system and that it needs special treatment. Under the OCC proposal, banks will be required to monitor and respond to climate-related risk even when immaterial, to undertake costly scenario analyses that are not required even for other material risks, and to labor under a series of requirements that have no role where other risks are concerned. This special concern for and attention to climate-related risks is irrational. There is no evidence that such risks stand above other dangers to the banking system or that banks need prompting to consider such risks. Climate risk does not need special treatment. With the Proposed Principles, the OCC ignores a more realistic and holistic approach to risk management in favor or political and social concerns. 1 OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021), Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback (Docket Number OCC-2021-0023), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html.
Second, the proposed special treatment of climate-related risk will come with great costs that the OCC cannot ignore. Under the Proposed Principles, banks will incur needless additional operating costs which they will pass on to consumers. Businesses that produce essential goods like electricity and other energy will find it more difficult to obtain credit. Americans who work for these businesses will suffer lost jobs. States that produce energy will also be adversely affected as OCC “principles” are used by lenders against energy producers. Critical consumer goods will become more expensive. Home loans in regions allegedly exposed to climate risk may become harder to obtain. Banks will be encouraged to exclude areas of the economy. The potential adverse effects of these Proposed Principles on states, businesses, and consumers cannot be overstated. The OCC does not and cannot show that the Proposed Principles justify these likely immense costs or that they benefit more than a few activists and politicians. Third, the Proposed Principles will force banks to monitor and account for speculative and immaterial risks. Banks will be required to spend more on professionals and compliance, trying to comply with these amorphous principles. Activists daily assert new, speculative harms from climate change. Under the Proposed Principles, banks may be forced to take each of these asserted harms seriously, constricting credit and other services to avoid entirely speculative risk. Fourth, the Proposed Principles are not guidance at all. These will become (and are likely intended to be) de facto legislative rules and administrative regulations. The Proposed Principles expand far beyond the scope of current law, bind the OCC staff, and given the extraordinary power the staff hold over regulated banks, it binds banks as well. The OCC should instead engage in rulemaking and provide the full set of analyses and procedures that must accompany such proceedings. Finally, the Proposed Principles also violate the OCC’s own regulations, in which the agency committed just a year ago that it would not attempt to issue binding regulations through guidance. The OCC’s casual disregard of its own regulations is one more reason the Proposed Principles, if finalized, would be arbitrary and capricious. The OCC should not adopt the Proposed Principles because they will not assist banks to assess and prepare for all material risks. Instead, the Proposed Principles will adversely affect states, businesses, and consumers and cause banks to incur more costs. The Proposed Principles may even weaken federally chartered banks and the national and state banking systems. BACKGROUND On December 16, 2021, the OCC issued OCC Bulletin 2021-62 entitled Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback.2 The bulletin regards the OCC’s “draft principles designed to support the 2 OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021), Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback (Docket Number OCC-2021-0023), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html. 2
identification and management of climate-related financial risks by banks with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets.”3 The bulletin links to a document entitled “ Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Bank (“Proposed Principles”).”4 OCC requests feedback on the Proposed Principles through February 14, 2022.5 The OCC starts the Introduction section of the Proposed Principles by stating that it “has identified the effects of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy as presenting emerging risks to banks and the financial system.”6 The OCC then differentiates between climate-related physical risks (e.g., hurricanes, floods, wildfires) and transition risks (e.g., “stresses to certain banks or sectors”), both of which are referred to in the Proposed Principles “as climate-related financial risks.”7 The Proposed Principles lists five general climate-related financial risk principles, as follows: (1) Governance; (2) Policies, Procedures, and Limits; (3) Strategic Planning; (4) Risk Management; and (5) Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting.8 The OCC states that “[m]anagement should develop and implement climate-related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile.”9 The Proposed Principles also list climate-related risk assessment principles, which are as follows: Credit Risk; Liquidity Risk; Other Financial Risk; Operational Risk; Legal/Compliance Risk; and Other Nonfinancial Risk.10 The OCC requested feedback on the Proposed Principles, including thirteen specific questions.11 DISCUSSION Proposed Principles Irrationally Single Out Climate-Related Risk for Special Treatment The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would irrationally single out climate-related risk for special treatment. Under existing law and regulations, banks are already obligated to achieve safety and soundness through monitoring and responding to risk from lending, operations, changes in law and policy, etc.12 The OCC’s staff, some of whom are on-site every day at the large banks to which the proposal applies, are obliged to ensure that banks monitor and respond to this risk appropriately.13 The OCC has previously stated that “[p]rudently managing climate 3 See id. 4 See id. 5 OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021), Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback (Docket Number OCC-2021-0023), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html. 6 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf. 7 See id. at p. 1. 8 See id. at pp. 1-3. 9 See id. at p. 4. 10 See id. at pp. 4-5. 11 See id. at pp. 5-7. 12 See, e.g., 12 C.F.R. pt. 30. 13 See 12 U.S.C. § 1 3
change risk is a safety and a soundness issue.”14 And many banks already take climate-related risk into account.15 The Proposed Principles go a big step further: they single out climate-related risk for unnecessary special treatment. Regulated banks no longer may simply treat climate-related risk as any other risk. Instead, banks must specifically focus on climate-related risk in a variety of ways. For instance: o The proposal directs that banks must communicate about climate-related risks in particular and must specially assign responsibilities for them “throughout the organization.”16 o Climate-related risk is singled out as the subject of mandatory reporting by bank management to the board.17 o Climate-related risk is singled out for assessment with regard to “stakeholders’ expectations, the bank’s reputation, and … disadvantaged households and communities.”18 o Banks must “incorporate climate-related risks into their internal control frameworks, including internal audit,”19 regardless of whether those risks would qualify for control or audit coverage under the procedures that the banks have reasonably adopted for other sorts of risk. o Bank management must “develop and implement … scenario analysis frameworks” for climate-related risks but not for other risks.20 o Banks are to “consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios.”21 Singling-out climate-related risk is unjustifiable. Climate-related eventualities do not pose greater risk than, for example, technological disruption, economic downturns, domestic 14 OCC, “OCC Announces Climate Change Risk Officer, Membership in the NGFS” (July 27, 2021), https://occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-78.html. 15 See, e.g., Bank of America, “Task force on climate-related financial disclosures report,” https://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact/task-force-on-climate-related-financial-disclosures-report (“As one of the world’s largest financial institutions, we are committed to ensuring that climate-related risks and opportunities are properly managed within our business.”). 16 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 2. 17 See id. at p. 2. 18 See id. at p. 3. 19 See id. at p. 3. 20 See id. at p. 4. 21 See id. at p. 4. 4
political changes, foreign conflicts, civic unrest, changing consumer tastes, non-climatic natural disasters, and public health crises such as the one ravaging the globe today. Even if climate- related risk were among the most important for some banks, there is no reason to believe that is true for all or most banks. Yet the proposal singles out only climate-related risk, and for all large banks. The Proposed Principles’ defenders may argue that the proposal only requires banks to monitor and respond to material climate-related risk, which they ought to do anyway under current law. This contention must be rejected for three reasons. First, the proposal does not limit its commands to material climate-related risk. For instance, management is directed to “regularly report[]” to the board on climate-related financial risks—without regard to whether such risks are regularly material.22 Similarly, banks are directed to “consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios”—without regard to whether those risks are material for particular portfolios.23 The result of the Proposed Principles would require banks to give climate-related risks a special place in their consideration without first determining that those risks are material. Second, the proposal irrationally singles out climate-related risk for special procedures that are not required even for other material risks. For instance, the proposal demands scenario analysis for climate-related risks.24 But banks are not required to conduct scenario analysis for other eventualities that pose material, and even greater, risk. Third, if the proposal’s only point is that banks should take material climate-related risk into account on the same terms and in the same ways as other risk, it should just say so, in the form of a simple reminder that the same requirements of assessing material risk with a view to safety and soundness apply to all kinds of risk. The largest banks, to which the Proposed Principles are directed, do not need more prompting to pay attention to climate-related risk as compared to other sorts of risk. Just the opposite is true. Such a reminder would in fact be unnecessary because the largest banks have shown a pronounced propensity to engage on issues surrounding climate-related risk.25 Because no guidance is needed to remind banks and examiners of existing legal requirements, there is no need for the Proposed Principles, and their issuance would therefore be arbitrary and capricious. 22 See id. at p. 2. 23 See id. at p. 4. 24 See id. at p. 4. 25 See, e.g., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Sustainability, https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/ sustainability/es- commitments; Citigroup, Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Report 2021, https://www.citigroup.com/citi/sustainability/data/taskforce-on-climate-related-financial-disclosures-report- 2021.pdf?linkId=148731631; Wells Fargo, Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-responsibility/climate-disclosure.pdf. 5
If the OCC is determined to act in this space, it should prepare guidance for every type of eventuality that poses a level of risk similar to that assertedly presented by climate change and should present a reasoned basis for singling out these types of eventualities as presenting higher degrees of risk than other types. The OCC’s failure even to ask whether singling out climate- related risk is needed, let alone to answer that question in the affirmative, is the essence of arbitrary decision-making. The proposal’s irrationality is exacerbated by the fact that, as we establish below, its directives are mandatory, although the proposal would be irrational even if optional. At the very least, the OCC should add to the proposal text making clear that banks are not required to treat climate-related risk differently than any other sort of risk. OCC Must Consider the Negative Effects The Proposed Principles will have considerable negative effects. OCC must consider these before adopting the Proposed Principles. A regulation that fails to weigh its benefits against its costs is irrational.26 Yet the proposal fails even to identify its costs, let alone assess whether the benefits it purports to achieve justify them. The Proposed Principles would impose serious real-world costs on banks, on the businesses to whom they lend, and on American citizens who depend on those businesses for their livelihoods and for goods and services and on the banks. By singling out climate-related risk for special treatment the Proposed Principles would force banks to implement procedures that are not justified by the prevention of financial harm— as indicated by the fact that the OCC does not require those procedures for comparable risk of other types. This may also empower litigation by activists and others seeking to influence or claim against the banks. This would pointlessly increase operating costs for banks, which will pass on these costs to customers. All these costs would be most heavily borne by small businesses, who will more often lack the resources to absorb an increase in the cost of credit or to modify their operations to cater to the demands of banks to avoid activities that generate climate-related risk. By requiring banks to treat climate-related risk more sensitively than risks of other types, the proposal would drive banks to assemble portfolios that are inefficient. Indeed, by driving banks to assemble portfolios weighted toward businesses that putatively represent low climate risk, the proposal would make portfolios less diverse and hence will increase risk in the banking system. Moreover, while the Proposed Principles purport to only target large banks they will inevitably affect community banks and credit unions. Banks would be encouraged to exclude areas of the economy. By singling out climate- related risk for special caution in the provision of credit, the Proposed Principles would prompt banks to deny credit, or offer credit on worse terms, to businesses that might be alleged to pose climate-related risk. This includes businesses such as mining and electric power companies, as well as others that may be alleged to be at risk from possible changes in law or public opinion regarding climate change. Because the proposal directs banks to consider climate-related risks to 26 Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743 (2015). 6
“the bank’s reputation,”27 banks would be forced to consider whether loan applicants are in favor with green activists or are green enough. Banks may (in good faith or otherwise) interpret the proposal to require that they lend only to businesses that make certain green commitments (net zero emissions by 2050, etc.). Businesses that are accused of or perceived as harming the climate may find it hard to obtain credit and/or reasonable loan terms. Banks may even believe they must refuse standard transactional services, such as banking accounts, to businesses that are in disfavor with green activists. Businesses that operate in regions that may be alleged to be exposed to climate risk, such as coastal or forested areas, would also find it harder and more expensive to obtain credit. Indeed, the proposal suggests that banks should “determine … lending limits” by reference to geographic location.28 This harm would extend to states whose economies rely on energy generation. The Proposed Principles will also hurt American citizens. As credit for businesses posing “climate risk” dries up, the Americans who work for those businesses or for other businesses who depend on them for goods or services would find their livelihoods in peril. Americans would find it harder to start small businesses alleged to pose such risks. Further, under the Proposed Principles, Americans who happen to live in areas that the banks may believe are at higher climate risk would find it harder to get home and business loans. And Americans would face higher charges for essential goods like electricity as the cost of credit for such goods increases. Americans would also suffer as towns—especially in rural America—lose businesses on which they depend for jobs that sustain a viable community life. Americans would further suffer from the broader societal risks inherent in the green policies that the proposal is meant to further. These policies risk creating economic downturns, undermining grid reliability, and impeding American trade competitiveness, to name just a few. But the Proposed Principles do not even acknowledge, let alone attempt to fathom, these risks, or to offset them against the asserted risks it addresses. The Proposed Principles fail to assess not just costs, but also benefits. It claims that its approach will enhance bank safety and soundness, but it does not establish a baseline of current bank practices with respect to climate-related risk or show how the approach taken in the proposal differs from that approach. Without such information, it is impossible to know whether the proposal marks any advance over current levels of safety and soundness and hence whether it is necessary. A regulation aiming at a problem is “highly capricious if that problem does not exist.”29 27 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at pp. 3, 5. 28 See id. at p. 4. 29 Alltel Corp. v.

Any rational approach to risk management, including climate-related risk, requires a robust cost-benefit analysis relying on rigorous economic, industrial, and consumer studies. But among its many questions, the Proposed Principles fail to ask about the costs and benefits of its mandates. If the OCC mistakenly elects to continue with this rulemaking, it should before finalization issue a request for information seeking the data it needs to assess and compare costs and benefits, then give careful heed to that data in any eventual finalization. Proposed Principles Force Banks to Account for Immaterial and Speculative Risk The Proposed Principles force banks to monitor and account even for speculative and immaterial risks. Despite having a stated purpose of helping banks manage risk arising from climate change, the Proposed Principles do not explain the nature and scope of that risk, leaving banks to feel their way blindly on this decisive question, or to guess what will best keep them out of regulatory audits and litigation. Predictions about the physical risks of climate change vary wildly, ranging from increasing numbers of hurricanes and wildfires to destruction from climate-driven great-power conflict or even more speculative claims.30 And predictive climate science is in its infancy.31 For these reasons the obstacles to understanding the risk of various climate eventualities, especially decades into the future, are immense. Yet the proposal fails to offer principles by which banks can determine which asserted physical risks are realistic in the OCC’s view and therefore should be considered. Further, the proposal demands that banks monitor and account for risk arising from climate-driven changes to the legal framework. But regulatory and (especially) legislative action is notoriously difficult to predict, and the Proposed Principles do not offer any means by which banks may weed out probable from speculative future regulatory and legislative developments or any safe harbors on which banks may rely in making judgments about such future government action. Faced with the proposal’s demand that banks monitor and respond to climate-related risk and the OCC’s refusal to explain which sorts of alleged risk are of concern, banks will have no choice but to err on the side of caution. Rather than run afoul of the OCC, they will take an unwarrantably and unpredictably expansive view of the risks of climate change, exacerbating the harms to the banking system, small businesses, and Americans discussed in the preceding section. Indeed, the proposal sanctions this approach: it urges banks to adopt “measures of conservatism” in the face of uncertainty.32 For this reason, too, the OCC should not finalize this proposal. If it does choose to finalize, then it should make clear that banks may form their own judgments about the likelihood 30 See Elizabeth Kolbert, “Three Scenarios for the Future of Climate Change,” New Yorker (Oct. 5, 2020). 31 The proposal itself admits that climate “[d]ata, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at a rapid pace.” P. 3. 32 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 5. 8
and magnitude of various asserted climate-driven eventualities and that the OCC will not second- guess those judgments. This is Rulemaking, Not Guidance The Proposed Principles are legislative rules masquerading as guidance. The OCC must treat it as a legislative rule. The “hallmark of legislative rules” is “[e]xpanding the footprint of a regulation by imposing new requirements, rather than simply interpreting the legal norms Congress or the agency itself has previously created.”33 The Proposed Principles expand the regulatory footprint in two ways. First, it decides once and for all that climate-related financial risk poses a graver risk to bank safety and soundness than other sorts of risk and therefore warrants special treatment. Regulated banks are no longer free to make their own prudential assessment in this area, as they do in others; they must act as though climate-related risk is of especially great concern. Second, the proposal establishes several concrete new requirements for regulated banks. See supra. Neither of the above represents a mere interpretation of existing legal duties.34 Indeed, the proposal does not cite a statute or regulation. It appears to deduce the new requirements from the general duty of safety and soundness,35 but that general standard neither singles out climate- related risk for special treatment nor creates the particular duties the proposal demands. The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would have binding force. The proposal binds banks to single out climate-related risk as of special concern. Banks under the OCC’s jurisdiction must remain safe and sound.36 The Proposed Principles declare the OCC’s position that climate- related financial risk implicates safety and soundness in an especially serious way.37 Banks are no longer free to reach their own conclusions on this issue. This determination from the OCC’s headquarters controls the actions of its supervisory staff. The OCC has a statutory duty to preserve safety and soundness.38 Its staff therefore cannot allow supervised banks to engage in behavior that the agency has determined would imperil safety and soundness.39 The proposal leaves OCC supervisory staff no opportunity for reaching different conclusions about climate- related risk; indeed, the proposal makes clear that the staff’s “supervisory expectations” will be 33 Iowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 873 (8th Cir. 2013); see also Gen. Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, 742 F.3d 1561, 1565 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (rule is legislative when it “create[s] … new rights or duties”). 34 See, e.g., Iowa League of Cities, 711 F.3d at 875 (legislative rule exists where no “preexisting … legislative rule … supplies the basis for the prohibition” in guidance). 35 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 2. 36 12 U.S.C. § 1(a). 37 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 1. 38 12 U.S.C. § 1. 39 OCC, Comptroller’s Handbook: Large Bank Supervision 11 (2019) (“If examiners determine that a risk is … not effectively managed … they must communicate to bank management and the board the need to mitigate or eliminate the unwarranted risk.”) (emphasis added). 9
shaped by the framework offered in the proposal.40 The OCC staff who closely supervise large banks must therefore require the banks they supervise to treat climate-related risk as the proposal demands. Because regulated banks know this, they must accept the proposal’s determination about climate-related risk if they do not wish for adverse action by their examiners. This is why the proposal simply assumes that banks will “incorporate[e] these principles [of the proposal] into their risk management systems.”41 It does not even consider whether banks might decline to accept this purported “guidance.” The Proposed Principles therefore resemble the EPA guidance found binding in Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015 (D.C. Cir. 2000), and Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311 (D.C. Cir. 2011), both of which committed agency staff—and therefore by extension the public regulated by those staff—to the positions taken by guidance. Indeed, the proposal presents the concerns in these cases in an aggravated form, for the OCC’s supervisory power is among the broadest and most powerful known to law. Regulated banks, as chartered entities, owe their very existence to the OCC. Moreover, examiners are on-site at large regulated banks at all times, with authority to “require action by bank management to address deficiencies before [they] compromise the bank’s safety and soundness.”42 The Proposed Principles also bind banks to implement its particular demands. The proposal states that an “effective risk governance framework is essential to a bank’s safe and sound operation,”43 and that such governance “includes” certain specific climate-related measures such as “assigning climate-related financial risk responsibilities throughout the organization.” Per the proposal, regulated banks that treat climate-related risk like other risks, rather than singling it out for, e.g., “assign[ment] … throughout the organization,” will fail at an “essential” element of safety and soundness. Similarly, the proposal often asserts that banks “should” comply with its demands. While this word can sometimes merely recommend, here the Proposed Principles make clear that banks “should” undertake the demanded measures if they want to remain safe and sound—and they are required by law to remain safe and sound. The guidance does not disclaim that it is binding or anywhere inform banks or the public that it does not bind. 40 P. 2; see also Community Nutrition Inst. v. Young, 818 F.2d 943, 946 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (explaining that the fact that a document constrains an agency’s discretion tends to show it is a legislative rule). 41 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 6. 42 Comptroller’s Handbook at 14. 43 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 2 (emphasis added). 1 0
The OCC should therefore admit that the proposal, if finalized, would constitute a legislative rule subject to the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The OCC should withdraw the proposal and (if it mistakenly chooses to proceed with the rulemaking) should reissue it with the full set of findings and analyses that ordinarily accompany a rulemaking. Further, the OCC should explain why a binding rulemaking, rather than optional guidance, is appropriate in these circumstances. Nothing in the proposal addresses this question, but a rulemaking that fails to engage whether a rulemaking (rather than guidance) is necessary at all is arbitrary and capricious. As Guidance, the Proposed Principles Violate OCC Regulations The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would violate the OCC’s own regulations because they would create a binding rule through purported guidance. Just a year ago, the OCC issued a regulation providing that “supervisory guidance does not have the force and effect of law.”44 In the preamble to that regulation, the OCC explained that “examples … included in supervisory guidance (including guidance that goes through public comment) are not binding on institutions,” but are “intended to be illustrative.”45 Yet, as explained above, the proposal if finalized would create a binding rule, and the examples it gives of practices banks must undertake to protect against climate-related risk are mandatory rather than illustrative. Moreover, the proposal if finalized would be arbitrary and capricious because the creation of a binding rule through guidance would constitute an unexplained departure from the agency’s own past practice, as codified in the agency’s own regulation on guidance.46 That the proposal passed through a comment period changes nothing because the OCC’s rule on guidance commits the agency not to issue binding guidance even through notice and comment. CONCLUSION The OCC should not adopt the Proposed Principles. Climate-related financial risk is not the gravest threat to our banking system and should not be elevated to that status over economic downturns, foreign wars, or public health crises. The direct costs of compliance and indirect cost to businesses and consumers may be devastating, increasing already high inflation but curtailing credit to the energy sector and further burdening low-income Americans. The Proposed Principles favor and elevate social and political issues to the detriment of states, businesses, consumers, and our banking system. Moreover, the Proposed Principles are labeled guidance, but will be treated and enforced as rules. The OCC should withdraw the Proposed Principles and proceed with rulemaking. 44 86 Fed.

They claim the proposal will impose unnecessary costs on banks, which will be passed on to consumers, and could harm businesses, particularly in the energy sector, by making credit harder to obtain.

Undoubtedly they had a role in the failure of COP26 to include gas and oil as targets of needed reform in combatting climate change. Banks have not exhibited any real concern about climate change, and probably will not do so until forced by regulation.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am sending this correspondence in response to the FDIC's request for on its statement of principles of  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of  First Option Bank located in communities surrounding the Kansas City Metro in Kansas and Missouri.  Most of our banks are in communities of less than 6000 people. We are a $600 Million community bank  providing home loans, small business and commercial loans, consumer loans and agriculture loans. In  several of the communities we are the most active lender remaining with a full service bank. After  reading what you have proposed, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate- risk management to banks like ours, a small community bank. This proposed framework would  negatively impact my communities. Community Banks with any exposure to agriculture have always  been impacted by climate-related risks. We've always accounted for those issues. Community Banks do  not pose a systemic risk to the financial system and a 'one size fits all' framework that is designed for  large complex institutions that do not know their clients well, or who do not live in the areas where  climate impacts occur regularly, could seriously affect our institution and the communities we serve.  Dealing with the costs and complexity of compliance as it currently is, and add something of this  magnitude, and I feel the expense would be insurmountable and unnecessarily duplicate our current risk  management practices. Weather has always played a role in our current practices when assessing loan  loss provisions and credit management. Living in Kansas, severe weather has always played a part in our  daily lives. Bankers in Kansas have always rallied to support their communities when tornados or other  severe weather incidents occur. With the adoption of CECL, we're already assessing risks such as climate  with the booking of each loan. This proposed regulation would create additional response and costs to  what we're already doing. I personally thank you for limiting the proposal currently to banks over the  $100 billion in asset threshold and I strongly encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community  bankers to understand why this proposal should never trickle down to community banks.

412,2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-065_39,"Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    PriorityOne Bank is a CDFI certified Community Bank with just over $900 million in assets,  headquartered in Magee, Mississippi, primarily serving the needs of small communities along the  Highway 49 corridor with branches as far south as Hattiesburg, MS and as far north as Ridgeland,  Mississippi. PriorityOne Bank submits this letter to the FDIC in response to the FDIC's request for  comments on its statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial  institutions. Specifically, PriorityOne Bank is concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this  climate-related financial risk management to community banks, which is unnecessary to manage safety  and soundness at any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets.  The primary concerns  affecting PriorityOne Bank are the FDIC's proposed framework that would require large banks to address  climate-related financial risk in its credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, strategic  planning, reputational risk and liability or litigation risk along with the requirement to perform scenario  analysis.  A separate risk management framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to  manage the safety and soundness at a Bank with just over $900 million in assets. The Bank's current  existing risk management practices are effective and have enabled community banks to manage  climate-related risk for decades. Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose systematic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management framework designed for large, complex institutions. Compliance with a climate-related  financial risk management framework would be expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate current  risk management practices the Bank already has is place through Disaster Recovery, which was shown to  be effective through past climate events such as Hurricane Katrina or various disastrous tornadoes the  Bank has faced through the years. With regard to financial stress caused by transition risk, the Bank's  Disaster Recovery plan saw it through COVID and its aftermath, again stressing the unnecessary burden  of duplicate risk management.  Further, with the adoption of CECL, PriorityOne Bank will need to be  even more concerned about reflecting future risks, such as the risk that the climate will change, in loan  loss reserves. The costs of the proposal, especially regarding scenario analysis will be unnecessarily  burdensome.  Mandated scenario analysis is problematic as it is an expensive exercise that requires  specialized third-party expertise, and it should not be mandatory for community banks, given the small  size, relative non-complexity and lower risk profile of community banks as compared to large banks.  PriorityOne Bank already implements stress testing its loan portfolio as part of transitioning to CECL  which eliminates the need for performing scenario analysis. Further, in order to conduct scenario  analysis for transition risks, community banks would need to gather climate data (such as greenhouse  gas emissions data) from their customers, many of which do not maintain this data and would object to  gathering and disclosing this data, which is overly burdensome Further, scenario analysis would require 
community banks to forecast for remote and speculative risks and be of little practical utility to  community banks that are already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage these risk.  The Bank would face many difficulties in hiring qualified experts to perform scenario analysis,  particularly if forced to compete with large banks to secure these services, as there are few individuals  located in PriorityOne Bank's community who are currently qualified to perform this work.  In  summation, the proposed Climate-Related Financial Risk Management Framework and the  implementation of scenario analysis to explore the impact of climate-related risk on PriorityOne Bank's  strategy and business model to identity and measure vulnerability to relevant climate related risk factors  including physical and transition risks, is unnecessarily burdensome for an institution with just over $900  million in assets.  PriorityOne Bank thanks the FDIC for the opportunity to submit comments on the  proposed framework and further thanks the FDIC for limiting its proposal to banks with more than $100  billion in assets and would encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community Bankers to better  understand why this proposal should not apply to community banks. Thank you for your time and  consideration.    Sincerely,    Robert J. Barnes   President & CEO  PriorityOne Bank   Magee, MS","PriorityOne Bank, a community bank with over $900 million in assets, expresses concerns about the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework, which is currently aimed at large financial institutions.

Please use your power to support our economy, our planet in its fight against the climate crisis. Thank you. 
Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment criticizes big banks for funding fossil fuel companies, arguing that such investments exacerbate the climate crisis.

Little by little this country is starting to come to grips with the possibility of a dire future. Yet, as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk.

We have frequently heard that solutions will not be easy. It is time to take on the tough solutions. Therefore as a first step, I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;

Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits;

It criticizes banks for claiming to phase out financing for greenhouse gas emissions while still investing heavily in fossil fuels, which exacerbates climate change and risks the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. The commenter urges regulators to prevent banks from making short-term decisions that endanger the economy and communities. They support proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management, plan for long-term climate change, define risk exposures, and align internal strategies with public climate commitments. The commenter emphasizes the need for the OCC to ensure banks' actions align with their zero carbon emissions commitments and to factor climate risk management into supervisory ratings. They call for the OCC to issue strong guidance and require banks to remedy unsafe practices, highlighting the importance of minimizing climate risk for both the public and banks."

Reyes  Attorney General  June 3, 2022  The Honorable Martin J. Gruenberg  Chairman  U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429  Submitted Electronically via Regulations.gov  Re:  Comments by the Attorneys General of West Virginia, Utah, Alabama, Alaska,  Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,  Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas,  and Wyoming on the request for comment entitled Principles for Climate-Related  Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (Docket No. FDIC-2022- 0020-0001)  Dear Chairman Gruenberg:  The undersigned Attorneys General submit these comments on the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation’s Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions, 87 Fed. Reg. 19,507 (Apr. 4, 2022) (“Proposed Principles”).  The States are  especially interested in this rule because the FDIC is exercising its prudential regulatory power  over state-licensed financial institutions.  These Principles track nearly word-for-word the proposed principles the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency issued in December 2021.  See Principles for Climate-Related  Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, OCC (Dec. 16, 2021), https://bit.ly/3z58kqj.   Although some interagency cooperation is appropriate in certain circumstances, copying the  language of another agency without explanation effectively abdicates the Corporation’s  independent regulatory responsibilities.  See, e.g., Hoosier Env’t Council v. U.S. Army Corps of  Eng’rs, 722 F.3d 1053, 1061 (7th Cir. 2013) (explaining that an agency had “an independent  responsibility to enforce” a given statute and therefore could not “just rubberstamp another 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 2  agency’s” work).  That approach is especially concerning here given that the Corporation is an  independent agency.  See, e.g., Jolina C. Cuaresma, Commissioning the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, 31 LOY. CONSUMER L. REV. 426, 450 n.109 (2019) (explaining how the FDIC  “has long been considered independent”).    In any event, the Proposed Principles are defective in at least four ways.  First, the Proposed  Principles purport to be guidance, but they are de facto legislative rules issued without adequate  notice.  Second, they are arbitrary and capricious because they single out climate-related risks even  though current regulations already account for those risks.  Third, they arbitrarily and capriciously  fail to include a cost-benefit analysis.  Fourth, they appear to be a pretextual effort to deprive  disfavored industries of access to banking services.  And fifth, they are overly vague and, in at least  some cases, would arbitrarily and capriciously require financial institutions to monitor and account  for immaterial risks.  BACKGROUND  The FDIC recently issued a “Request for Comment on Statement of Principles for Climate- Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.”  See Request for Comment  on Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions, FDIC (Mar. 30, 2022), https://bit.ly/3NpEe4O.  The request seeks comments to help  provide a “high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate- related financial risks.”  Id.  This new framework (which was published in the Federal Register a  few days later) would nominally apply only to “large [state-licensed, non-member] financial  institutions with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets.”  Id.  But in practice, these principles  would apply more broadly, as the FDIC notes that “all financial institutions … may have material  exposures to climate-related financial risks.”  Id. The Corporation highlighted four aspects of the Proposed Principles.  First, the Proposed  Principles address supposed “[w]eaknesses in how financial institutions identify, measure,  monitor, and control” climate risks.    Request for Comment on Statement of Principles for Climate- Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.  Second, they “provide a  high-level framework for the safe and sound management” for these risks.  Id.  Third, they will  purportedly “help financial institution management make progress toward addressing key  questions” about how climate might affect their business.  Id.  Fourth and finally, they reflect how  the “FDIC encourages financial institutions to consider” climate risks in a way that meets “the  financial services needs of their communities.”  Id.  In the Proposed Principles themselves, the FDIC set out general climate-related financial  risk principles on six topic areas:    1. Governance: how a company supervises and manages itself;   2. Policies, Procedures, and Limits: the rules a company sets for its own operations;  3. Strategic Planning: how a company looks to address issues and grow;   4. Risk Management: how a company handles potential risks;  
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 3  5. Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting: how a company collects data around, analyzes,  and reports risks; and   6. Scenario Analysis: “exercises used to conduct a forward-looking assessment of the  potential impact on an institution” of various changes or the “distribution of physical  hazards resulting from climate-related risks.”    Proposed Principles at 19,509-10.    Similarly, the FDIC also enumerated six climate-related risk categories.  They are:  1. Credit Risk: the possibility of losses from loans not being repaid;  2. Liquidity Risk: the possibility of a lack of liquidity that leads to an institution’s failure to  meet its obligations;  3. Other Financial Risk: any other risks that would affect an institution’s finances, including  the failure of an investment or a drop in a currency’s value.  4. Operational Risk: the risk of loss from internal failures;  5. Legal/Compliance Risk: the risk associated with legal actions and cost of compliance with  regulations; and  6. Other Nonfinancial Risk: all other risks that do not relate to the institution’s finances.  Proposed Principles at 19,510-11.  The FDIC requested feedback on the Proposed Principles.  Id. at 19,511-12.  The undersigned States are taking the Corporation up on its request for feedback on  these significant proposed changes.  DISCUSSION  I. The Proposed “Guidance” Appears To Be Rulemaking In Disguise.  Despite labeling its proposal a “statement of principles,” the Corporation’s proposed  “principles” almost certainly constitute legislative rules.  A legislative rule is “[a]n agency action  that purports to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated parties.”  Nat’l  Mining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 251-52 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  The Proposed Principles  appear to do this very thing: They place brand new requirements on regulated parties and are not  “merely interpret[ing] a prior statute or regulation.”  Id. at 252.  The Proposed Principles change  the FDIC’s previous requirements and thus have the overwhelming appearance of legislative rules.   See Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002, 1021 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (A rule that “effects a substantive  change in existing law or policy” is “necessarily [a] legislative rule[].”)  In fact, save a fleeting  reference to the FDIC’s general power to issue safety-and-soundness standards, Proposed  Principles at 19,509, the Corporation does not mention prior statutes or regulations at all.  And the  Proposed Principles repeatedly use “should” directives; that language is usually construed as  mandatory.  See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 798 F.2d 919, 924 (7th Cir. 1986) (“The common 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 4  interpretation of the word ‘should’ is ‘shall.’”).  In short, the Proposed Principles overwhelmingly  appear to be legislative rules disguised as guidance.    The Proposed Principles resemble the EPA’s guidance that the D.C. Circuit deemed  binding in Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  In  that case, the court found that a rule styled as “[g]uidance” was actually a legislative rule because  it bound EPA’s regional directors.  Id. at 321-22.  So too here.  The FDIC should reconsider the  Proposed Principles to avoid this mistake.  As is, the Proposed Principles require regulated  financial institutions to consider climate-related risks above other risks; any bank that chooses to  do otherwise could face serious consequences during a bank examination.  It seems that the FDIC  is thus planning to impose its risk-assessment preferences without regard to the institutions’ own  professional assessments or preferences.  Because this mandate would necessarily alter the  institutions’ risk-management strategies, it bears the marks of a rule—not guidance.  The FDIC should thus subject the Proposed Principles to the Administrative Procedure  Act’s procedural requirements, lest “a reviewing court” “set aside” the Proposed Principles for  “fail[ing] to observe” those requirements.  See Iowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 855  (8th Cir. 2013). And it should heed reviewing courts’ warnings against an agency “issu[ing] or  amend[ing] its real rules, i.e., its interpretative rules and policy statements, quickly and  inexpensively without following any statutorily prescribed procedures.”  Appalachian Power Co.  v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1020 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  In short, the FDIC should not rely on “subsequent  guidance” to provide the specific, discernible standards upon which regulated institutions depend.   Proposed Principles at 19,509, 19,510.  It should instead withdraw the proposal and reissue it with  the full set of findings and analyses that ordinarily accompany a rulemaking.  Further, the FDIC  should do more than give conclusory judgments to explain why rulemaking is necessary in the first  place.    II. The Proposed Principles Arbitrarily And Capriciously Target Climate-Related  Risk.  The Proposed Principles emphasize climate-related risks because of claimed “emerging  economic and financial risks.”  Proposed Principles at 19,508.  The Corporation is vague about  what it has in mind, referencing mostly a myriad of attenuated risks like “wildfires,” “droughts,”  and “rising … sea levels.”  Id.  But the FDIC failed to adequately demonstrate how these potential  events relate to its core mission of regulating certain FDIC-insured financial institutions.  So the  Proposed Principles are arbitrary and capricious.  See Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579  U.S. 211, 221 (2016) (An agency must “give adequate reasons for its decisions.”). Even assuming  the FDIC could demonstrate the connection between financial soundness and environmental  change, the FDIC has not adequately explained why new regulations are necessary in light of  current rules that cover the same field.    Financial institutions are already required to undertake “[e]ffective risk assessment” and  have “[a]dequate procedures to safeguard and manage assets.”  12 C.F.R. pt. 364 II.A.2, A.4.   These controls must be “appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature, scope and risk of  its activities.”  Id. II.A.  Thus, if climate risks are a real threat to an institution, then under current 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 5  regulations they should already be part of that institution’s risk assessment scheme.  Likewise,  regulated institutions are already subject to stringent liquidity requirements.  The Proposed  Principles do nothing except impose redundant regulations and burdens on financial institutions.   See Proposed Principles at 19,508-11.  “Reasoned decisionmaking … calls for an explanation for  agency action.”  Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2576 (2019).  Yet the FDIC never  explains why it considers this redundant regulation necessary.  Without this explanation, the  Proposed Principles are arbitrary and capricious.  See Am. Equity Inv. Life Ins. Co. v. SEC, 613  F.3d 166, 179 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (vacating an SEC rule because it failed “to determine whether,  under the existing regime, sufficient protections existed”).   The Proposed Principles also single out climate risks—which are unrelated to the financial  institution’s day-to-day business—when numerous other eventualities pose equal or greater risks.   Economic downturns, foreign conflicts, changing consumer tastes, non-climate-related natural  disasters, and public health crises, for example, all can and have had catastrophic effects on  financial institutions.  Yet, the FDIC has subjected none of these issues to special regulation.  The  FDIC should explain why it focused its attention on climate risks as more important than numerous  others.  Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-74 (1886) (“Though the law itself be fair on its  face, and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority … so  as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar  circumstances … the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the [C]onstitution.”). The Corporation’s failure to explain why it proposes to treat climate-related risks with heightened  scrutiny takes the Proposed Principles out of the “zone of reasonableness” and makes the action  arbitrary and capricious.  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158-61 (2021).   Indeed, the Corporation fails to cite any empirical data establishing that climate-related risk  presents any safety-and-soundness concern, let alone one so significant that it requires special  treatment.  III. The Proposed Principles Lack A Cost-Benefit Analysis.  The Proposed Principles also do not discuss the potential costs of imposing these new  requirements.  This silence is telling—it means that the FDIC has failed to perform a proper cost- benefit analysis, in spite of its self-recognized obligation to do so in rulemaking.  See FDIC OFF. OF INSPECTOR GEN., COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS PROCESS  FOR RULEMAKING (2020),  https://bit.ly/38FdnTQ (describing the FDIC’s cost-benefit analyses and noting past failures of the  FDIC to properly conduct them).  Just as calling the proposal “guidance” does not change the  reality that it would function as a legislative rule, it also does not erase the FDIC’s duty to conduct  a proper cost-benefit analysis.    Make no mistake: cost-benefit analysis is required.  Congress empowered the Corporation  to implement “appropriate” operational or managerial standards for regulated institutions.  12  U.S.C.A. § 1831p-1.  The Supreme Court has held that an agency charged with determining  whether a regulation is “appropriate or necessary” must consider cost as part of that determination.   Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 759 (2015).  This cost-benefit analysis must be performed at an  early enough stage to allow interested parties time to respond.  Any failure to do so would render  the Proposed Principles arbitrary and capricious.  See id.
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 6  The Corporation’s failure to conduct an adequate cost-benefit analysis is especially  problematic given that the Proposed Principles would have tremendous negative effects.  We  expect that financial institutions would have to bear huge costs in terms of both money and  personnel to comply.  Compliance costs like these are the “most important[] cost[s]” that an agency  “must consider.”  Michigan, 576 U.S. at 759.  Those costs could be especially high given the  current lack of data on climate-related risk and the relative novelty of some of the methodologies  that the Corporation proposes to require, such as scenario analysis.  Additionally, the complexity  and scope of the Proposed Principles would open up financial institutions to greater litigation risks,  another obvious cost that the FDIC has not addressed.  The FDIC says this regulation will apply to only the “largest financial institutions,”  Proposed Principles at 19,509, but the effects will be felt more broadly.  Large financial institutions  will inevitably disperse their compliance costs onto others through higher interest rates and other  means.  Thus, it is small businesses and individuals—who cannot pass on costs further  downstream—who will suffer from the increased operating costs the proposal will force onto  financial institutions.  And because the Proposed Principles required consideration of climate- related risks “as part of the underwriting” process, individuals who live in areas that financial  institutions believe are at climate risk would likely find it harder to buy homes or start businesses,  particularly if the home or business itself is alleged to contribute to the conditions that give rise to  climate risk.  Id. at 19,510.  These costs are yet more in a long list that the Proposed Principles  failed to consider.  IV. The Proposed Principles Appear To Constitute A Pretextual Effort To “De-Bank”  Certain Industries.  The Proposed Principles would also have an unjustifiably negative effect on certain  industries.  For instance, the proposal directs financial institutions to consider climate-related risks  concerning “the institution’s reputation” and “stakeholders’ expectations,” so regulated  institutions are likely to consider whether credit applicants are politically favored in terms of their  climate efforts when deciding whether to extend credit.  Proposed Principles at 19,510.  Thus,  industries such as mining or power generation would be particularly vulnerable.  Businesses in  these industries may more often have credit denied, or be offered credit on worse terms than  otherwise similarly situated applicants.  Limiting these businesses’ financial access would likely  raise the cost of everyday necessities like electricity—a concern to which the FDIC should be more  attuned, not less, in the current economic environment.  Similarly, customers located in geographic  areas thought to be most affected by climate change (like coastal areas or sensitive agricultural  regions) might find it difficult to obtain credit at all, lest the lending institution face criticism from  the examiner for assuming undue risk.  The Corporation’s failure to explain the supposed need for an immediate revision of the  supervisory standards strongly implies that the effort is pretextual.  Although “a court may not  reject an agency’s stated reasons for acting simply because the agency might also have had other  unstated reasons,” including political ones, a court may set aside agency action where the record  demonstrates that “the sole stated reason” for the action is pretextual and “contrived.”  New York,  139 S. Ct. at 2573-75.  The Proposed Principles—which encourage regulated institutions to target 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 7  “certain companies or sectors” that the FDIC believes “may become less competitive” over time— appear ripe for such a challenge.  Proposed Principles at 19,508.  Indeed, the Proposed Principles  go so far as to require a financial institution’s board and management to adopt an “appropriate  understanding” of climate-related risk—that is, a view of climate change consistent with the  Corporation’s.  Id. at 19,509.  At the same time, the Proposed Principles repeatedly call on  regulated institutions to divert attention to “low- to moderate-income (LMI) and other  disadvantaged households and communities,” see, e.g., id. at 19,509, further suggesting that the  Corporation is pressing a deliberate reallocation of capital access.    The Corporation should be intimately familiar with the consequences of policies targeting  disfavored industries after it pursued similar policies as part of its regulatory misadventure known  as Operation Chokepoint.  There, as here, the FDIC sought to deny banking services to certain  industries that the then-current President’s administration did not favor.  See Letter from Stephen  E. Boyd, Assistant Att’y Gen., to the Honorable Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Comm. on the  Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives (Aug. 16, 2017), available at https://bit.ly/3MzydCF  (describing the FDIC’s “misguided” “Operation Chokepoint” and reaffirming the Department of  Justice’s view that “law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an  industry that a particular administration might disfavor”).  Yet given that this “guidance” comes  one year after President Biden directed members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to  evaluate climate-related risk, it would appear that the Corporation is poised to make the same  mistake again.  See Exec. Order No. 14,030, 87 Fed. Reg. 27,967 (May 20, 2021).   V. The Proposed Principles Are Arbitrarily And Capriciously Vague And May  Require Monitoring And Reporting Of Immaterial Risks.  Despite their stated purpose of providing a “framework for the safe and sound management  of exposures to climate-related risk,” Proposed Principles at 19,509, the Proposed Principles do  little to explain the actual nature and scope of that risk to financial institutions.  This vagueness  leaves unclear how institutions are supposed to operate in this realm, opening them to litigation or  additional audit risk from failure to comply with vague requirements.  By not laying out the facts  supporting the proposal or explaining how exactly institutions should respond, the FDIC has failed  to provide a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Little Sisters of  the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. 2367, 2383 (2020).  Predictions about the physical risks of climate change vary greatly and include a massive  number of potential consequences.  The FDIC itself lists “flooding, hurricanes, wildfires, and  droughts” as examples.  Proposed Principles at 19,508 n.3.  But empirical data from the Federal  Reserve Board show that severe weather events have little effect on bank performance.  See  Kristian S. Blickle, et al., How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks?, 990 FED. RESERVE BANK  OF N.Y. STAFF REP. 1, 1 (2022 revision), available at https://nyfed.org/3wHA42U (“When we  consider all FEMA disasters, we find generally insignificant or small effects on bank performance  and stability.”).  In any event, with such an array of eventualities, financial institutions face a  monumental task in discerning which they must prepare for and how.  Not even the largest  institutions can make accurate predictions.  Yet the proposal fails to offer concrete guidance for  financial institutions to help them decide what specific problems to consider and how to address 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 8  them.  In arbitrary-and-capricious review, courts look for a clear enough explanation that an  agency’s “path may reasonably be discerned.”  Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys.,  Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974).  The FDIC’s current path is impossible even to recognize, let alone  follow.  Additionally, the Proposed Principles’ vagueness expands their scope and will force banks  to consider immaterial risks.  For example, banks are specifically instructed to consider “physical  risks” such as “flooding, hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts.”  Proposed Principles at 19,508 n.3.   This natural-disaster-related mandate is imposed without any qualification or explanation as to  when banks must consider these risks.  Does a bank in Montana have to explicitly consider and  evaluate its hurricane risk?  In their current state, the Proposed Principles say yes.    The Proposed Principles also require financial institutions to consider outright impossible  concerns such as the climate’s effect on “the evolving legal and regulatory landscape.”  Proposed  Principles at 19,511.  The future of legislation and regulation is notoriously difficult to predict, so  institutions will be forced to rely on extremely speculative guesses about what might happen.  The  Proposed Principles offer no meaningful guidance as to what the FDIC expects from them.   Guessing games like this legislative look-ahead are harmful and inappropriate for financial  institutions upon which so many peoples’ livelihoods depend.  Yet, the Proposed Principles  actually encourage banks to limit access to capital based on unfounded fears and guesses, saying  that institutions should “include corresponding measures of conservatism in their risk  measurements and controls” when considering climate risks.  Id. at 19,511.  Banks should not be  limiting access to capital based on unsupported supposition and political preferences.    CONCLUSION  The FDIC should not adopt the Proposed Principles.  If adopted as written, they would  constitute a procedurally improper and arbitrary and capricious legislative rule.  We urge the FDIC  to reconsider its proposal.

389,2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-065_18,"Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley: I am writing this letter in regard to the FDIC's request for comment on climate  related financial risk management. Farmers & Merchants Bank is a $260 million asset community bank  with five branches serving suburban and rural markets in Southwest Ohio. As President and CEO of our  community bank I appreciate your consideration of concerns with potential new rules that will  ultimately impact all FDIC regulated banks. While the current proposals are targeted at banks with over  $100 billion in total consolidated assets we all know that the same rules will either trickle down over  time or be applied to smaller institutions as ""best practices"".  Banks have always been, and always will  be, in the risk management business. While we do not specifically measure each and every type of risk,  but we do consider all risk factors before lending to our customers and helping them with their small  business and daily needs. While we have not historically used the term ""climate risk,"" it is specifically  considered and managed. We require our farmers to carry crop insurance that covers their crops from  catastrophic weather-related events. We require any building owner located in flood zone to carry flood  insurance. We talk with business owners about their internet technology, backups, and security if  applicable to the stability of their company. These are just a few obvious ways that for almost one  hundred years we have been around and able to manage and update as needed to mitigate potential  climate risk on a daily basis.  I can assure you that community banks do not pose systemic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management practices. We have always monitored our loans as a percentage of capital by types and  categories. This deliberate monitoring of concentration risk prohibits us from getting into any one  industry or type of lending too deep. We maintain less the 15% of capital to any one industry to  eliminate the risk of a catastrophic ending to any one industry. This helps manage all types of risk from  pandemic to climate risk, or just an overall failure in a certain industry due to supplies or changing times.   Having to conduct scenario analysis and additional modeling or monitoring would be yet another  regulatory burden to our institution. These proposals would create extra hours spent on each and every  loan in our portfolio that would likely also lead to the need for additional staff. There is no doubt that  these new proposals will not only be a time burden but also a significant cost burden. The time and staff  requirements would be a huge negative impact that would create a cost that would have to be passed  along to the consumers. In addition, these scenario analysis and future modeling generally end up  creating additional software expense to help try and effectively manage the process. Software always  has annual cost in addition to the larger one-time expense of purchasing and implementation.  In  summary, I strongly urge the FDIC considered what we are already doing to manage and mitigate  climate risk. Many banks have been around for over one hundred years and been very effective at  managing this risk without the ""help"" of these new proposals. This needs to be considered given the  limited resources available at small institutions and the great burden these reporting requirements  would create.  - Shon Myers, Miamisburg, OH","Shon Myers, President and CEO of Farmers & Merchants Bank, expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management rules, which currently target banks with over $100 billion in assets. He argues that these rules may eventually apply to smaller banks, like his $260 million asset community bank in Ohio. Myers emphasizes that community banks have long managed various risks, including climate risks, through practices like requiring crop and flood insurance. He contends that community banks do not pose systemic risks and should not be subject to ""one-size-fits-all"" regulations. Myers warns that the proposed rules would impose significant time and cost burdens, requiring additional staff and software expenses, which would ultimately affect consumers. He urges the FDIC to consider the effective risk management practices already in place at small banks and the potential negative impact of new regulatory requirements on these institutions."

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street, NW  Washington, DC 20429    RE: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions; Comment Request (RIN 3064-ZA32)  Dear Mr. Sheesley,  Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the FDIC’s Principles for Climate-Related Financial  Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.  This letter is being sent on behalf of MidWestOne Bank  (hereafter referred to as “the Bank”).    MidWestOne Bank is an Iowa chartered bank founded on October 15, 1934.  The Bank is focused on  delivering relationship-based business and personal banking products and services. The Bank provides  commercial, real estate, agricultural, credit card, and consumer loans. The Bank also provides deposit  products including demand and interest checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts,  and time deposits. Complementary to our loan and deposit products, the Bank provides additional products  and services including treasury management, Zelle, online and mobile banking, debit cards, ATMs, and  safe deposit boxes. The Bank offers its products and services primarily through its network of 56 full-service  banking offices, located throughout central and eastern Iowa, the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area  of Minnesota, western Wisconsin, Naples and Fort Myers, Florida, and Denver, Colorado. The Bank also  offers comprehensive wealth management solutions for its customers through its trust department, which  offers services including the administration of estates, personal trusts, and conservatorships and the  management of real property, as well as investment services, including financial planning, investment  advisory, and retail securities brokerage services.  MidWestOne Bank is primarily regulated by the Federal  Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) and as of March 31, 2022, had total assets of $5.96 billion.  We understand that given the $100 billion threshold on the current statement of principles that they would  not technically apply to the Bank.  However, we are choosing to comment on these principles because the  FDIC has indicated that this is the first iteration of guidelines that may ultimately apply to all FDIC banks.   We appreciate the FDIC’s recognition that these principles would impose significant burdens if applied to  smaller banks.  We believe that guidance should not be expanded to smaller institutions until climate risk  is better quantified and understood and should be tailored to avoid unnecessary operational burdens.   The Bank is working on an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risk assessment across all  departments of the bank identifying enterprise-wide environmental impact which includes climate-related  risk as the primary environmental risk factor. The reach of climate-related risk is very broad across the Bank  and determining key metrics and data to track in this area will take an extended amount of time and  resources to implement.   
Climate-related risk is already incorporated into the Bank’s existing risk-management frameworks.  Banks  base business decisions on current and historical market data, which provides information on the risk of a  transaction.  Accordingly, climate-related risks are naturally embedded into the risk identification and  management process.  These current risk management practices are effective and have enabled  community banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. Compliance with an additional climate- related risk management framework would be costly and duplicative of current practices. The Bank currently  manages climate-related risk through existing practices including branch location analysis, lending policies  and procedures, concentration risk monitoring and adequate insurance requirements for both the Bank and  loan customers to protect against natural disasters.  These practices have proved to be effective as the  Bank and its customers have endured droughts, hurricanes, floods, tornados, and a derecho.  Supervisory expectations should be flexible, allowing for significant modification as events occur, as the  practice of climate risk identification develops, and the risks become more clearly defined.  Regulation  based on the assumptions and data behind today’s definitions and understanding of climate-related  financial risk would be premature.  The FDIC should take a flexible, high-level approach that allows banks  to assess their risks based on their unique circumstances.  Community banks are critical to thriving communities, providing financing to individuals, companies, and  communities.  To avoid economic disruption or harm, prudential regulators should not impose prescriptive  regulatory requirements on climate-related risks.  Doing so at this time of economic stress, particularly  with respect to transition risks, could shape bank business decisions for regulatory reasons, rather than  true safety and soundness concerns.   Sincerely,  Susan Moore  Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer  smoore@midwestone.com","MidWestOne Bank, an Iowa-chartered bank, provides feedback on the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management principles for large financial institutions. Although the principles currently apply to banks with over $100 billion in assets, MidWestOne, with $5.96 billion in assets, comments due to potential future applicability. The bank appreciates the FDIC's acknowledgment of the burden these principles could impose on smaller banks and argues against expanding them until climate risks are better understood. MidWestOne is conducting an ESG risk assessment, incorporating climate risks into existing frameworks. They argue that current risk management practices, which include branch location analysis, lending policies, and insurance requirements, are effective and that additional frameworks would be costly and redundant. The bank advocates for flexible, high-level regulatory approaches that consider unique circumstances and warns against prescriptive regulations that could disrupt economic stability and influence business decisions based on regulatory rather than safety concerns."

Given the intensifying pace of climate change, it is important to have a continuous  dialogue with banking regulators to develop and determine the best approach to the  treatment of climate-related financial risks.      We welcome the agencies’ principles-based approach to addressing risk management  practices related to climate risk.

                                                                                       2    principles and guidance surrounding new and emerging climate-related financial risks  that align with the existing risk management regulatory framework. We believe that  climate-related financial risks are drivers of existing risks. Accordingly, banks are at a  developmental stage in embedding these risks into their existing risk management  frameworks.     As an initial matter, we are concerned with a statement in the FDIC’s preamble to the  proposed principles that was not included in the OCC’s proposal.  Specifically, the  FDIC’s preamble states that “the manner in which financial institutions manage climate- related financial risks to address safety and soundness concerns should also seek to  reduce or mitigate the impact that management of these risks may have on broader  aspects of the economy.”  We are concerned that this vague statement suggests that  financial institutions are subject to an obligation to manage risks in order to lessen the  impact of activities “on broader aspects of the economy.”  This would not only be an  unprecedented requirement for financial institutions to have to comply with, but it also  could have the unintended impact of forcing banks to develop risk management practices  related to the “broader economy” that are impossible to measure in practice.  We  therefore request that the FDIC delete this reference in the final iteration of these climate- risk guidelines.    Currently, our member banks’ risk management practices, in the context of climate- related financial risk, have centered around the identification and evaluation of potential  climate-related financial risks under different scenarios, specifically focusing on  assessing potential materiality for different risks over different time horizons.5 These  efforts have helped identify some inadequacies and challenges, including data limitations  and complexities arising from a variety of different scenarios and time horizons.  However, given the various challenges our members face when conducting scenario  analysis, as explained in more detail below, we believe it is currently premature to  incorporate climate-related financial risks into capital and liquidity adequacy assessment.      Our comments below focus on four (4) key areas that are particularly important to our  members as they are an integral part of an effective risk-management framework. These    include:    • Data: The availability of relevant, accurate and timely data is the key  impediment in quantifying climate-related financial risks into banks’ exposures.    • Scenario analysis: Institutions should have flexibility to create their own model  designs with the data available based on principles-based regulatory guidance.   • Responsibility of the board: An effective risk-management framework should  clearly distinguish and define the role and responsibility of the board relative to  senior management.     5 To-date, banks have employed various time horizons in determining climate-related risk. 
                                                                                       3    • Regulatory coordination: As climate-related financial risks are global in  nature, regulators should use their best efforts to coordinate on a regional and  international basis when establishing principles or guidance that address climate  risk.     Data    The key challenge that banks face in incorporating climate-related financial risk into their  respective risk management frameworks is the fact that existing data and tools to measure  and quantify climate-related financial risk—and in particular, longer-term transition and  physical risks—are only just emerging. Such data will need to undergo substantial  exploration, refinement, and adaptation over time. Although data capabilities are  improving, significant gaps in data sourcing, capture, standardization, and aggregation  substantially affect the accuracy of projections and risk assessment. For example, there is  a growing disparity between the increasing availability of transition risk data as compared  to less available physical risk data. Consequently, banks’ ability to understand and  analyze physical risks is still evolving.     In this regard, we agree with the agencies’ view reflected in the Principles that sound risk  management is significantly dependent on the availability of relevant, accurate, and  timely data. We also appreciate that the Principles acknowledge that the development of  bank risk management frameworks to embed climate-related financial risks is iterative  and will continue to evolve alongside wider developments, such as the availability of  better quality, and more specific data.     Accordingly, any additional guidance published subsequent to these Principles should  take a flexible approach, encouraging banks to individually consider, with the data  presently available, how climate-related financial risks impact their particular business  and respective risk management frameworks.     Scenario Analysis     We agree with the agencies that climate-related scenario analysis is an important tool that  can be used to explore the potential impacts of climate-related financial risks on banks’  portfolios and the overall business model. We recognize that such an exercise could  enhance efforts to understand potential impacts, limitations, and improve our  understanding of what needs to or can be done in the context of climate-related financial  risk.     We are supportive of the agencies’ view that firms should develop and implement  climate-related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s  size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile. To-date, our members are actively 
                                                                                       4    engaged in developing their scenario analysis capabilities and running exercises across  different parts of their portfolios.     Given liquidity and shorter term nature of trading book positions, banks may not deem this risk as  material and should have flexibility around how to incorporate climate into market risk  measurement.  We support further development of climate scenarios to reach a consensus  on available scientific and economic forecasts and a range of scenarios, such that  individual banks can then tailor their approach to reflect their bank specific business  models and risk profiles. For example, the Network for Greening the Financial System,  Representative Concentration Pathways, and International Energy Agency’s scenarios  can be used to meet regulatory and risk management needs.    Also, publicly available climate scenarios do not provide banks with the appropriate  sectoral and regional granularity to directly translate scenario output into readily  consumable inputs for internal risk modeling. For banks, the value of climate scenario  analysis can only be fully realized when the science-based or macroeconomic output is  expanded into more granular financial impacts that can be applied across a diverse set of  client industries and sub-sectors. Additionally, there is still a limited understanding of the  climate economic models that drive these scenarios, which makes it more challenging for  banks and vendors alike to expand scenario output while staying within the bounds of the  model.    Given these challenges, scenario analysis should be considered an exploratory exercise,  at this point in time, that enables firms to identify key areas of the business model that  could be impacted by climate risk (both transition and physical) events. Conducting such  exercises should also inform the firm’s modelling strategies as the industry gradually  develops more sophisticated capabilities. Indeed, many of our members are participating  in industry-wide initiatives developing scenario analysis frameworks and methodologies  to assess climate-related impact. In this regard, any guidance from the agencies should be  principle-based and should allow institutions to have flexibility to create their own model  designs with the information at-hand.       Responsibility of the Board     We are concerned that, as drafted, the Principles sometimes inappropriately equate the  role of the board to that of the senior management, and thus, improperly assign  responsibilities to both the board and senior management interchangeably. For example,  the Principles recommend that the board “incorporate climate-related risks into [banks’]  internal control frameworks” and “monitor how climate-related financial risks affect the  bank’s exposure to risk related to changing prices.” These types of responsibilities run  counter to the board’s role as an oversight body that oversees and challenges the  executive management team, holding the executive to account. In this regard, we  recommend that references to “monitoring” should include only management and not the 
                                                                                       5    board. Such responsibilities are better suited for the senior management and key staff that  have access to the day-to-day information and can create and amend policies within the  bank based on the available information. Blurring the lines between boards and  executives could defy the purpose of strong internal governance.    In addition, the Principles place a significant amount of responsibility on the board with  respect to strategic direction as it relates to climate-related financial risk and fail to  recognize banks’ various internal management structures. For example, the board is  expected to determine the bank’s “risk appetite” in the context of climate-related  financial risk, whilst this is typically the responsibility of senior management. In general,  banks may assign these responsibilities in different ways. In certain cases, the board may  play a more hands-on role; while in other cases, the senior management designs and  crafts the banks’ strategic direction, with the board endorsing the plan and providing  general oversight.       We provide a few other examples where we think this distinction could be better  clarified:    • Governance section   o A materiality concept should be included in this section, as it is elsewhere  (e.g., “actively oversee the bank’s material risk taking activities”).  o The general statement “sound governance includes . . .” would benefit  from some delineation between board and management responsibilities.   • Strategic planning section – “Boards” should not be included in references to  public statements as this is beyond the scope of what the board would actually be  tasked with, in particular “any” public statement.  • Credit risk section – Suggest amending the last sentence to “Management should  determine changes to credit risk appetite or relevant risk management metrics as a  result of climate risk, which would be approved by the board these risks.” The  Principles should also clarify that management “determines” and the board  approves credit risk appetite.  Accordingly, the Principles would benefit from: (1) more flexibility in acknowledging  various bank structures, (2) clear differentiation between the roles of the board and senior  management, and (3) recognition that, in general, a board’s responsibilities with respect  to the governance are distinct from the responsibilities of the bank’s senior management.     Regulatory Coordination     Given a fast-evolving landscape, the effective global coordination of prudential and  supervisory principles is critical. Our members are keen on global financial regulators 
                                                                                       6    developing common principles of how to address climate-related financial risks across  the financial system.    Global regulatory coordination will support banks in embedding climate-related financial  risks into their risk management frameworks, including across operating entities in  different jurisdictions. Any finalized Principles should address the need for harmonized  supervisory principles, domestically and internationally.    In this regard, we would welcome additional, coordinated guidance from the regulatory  community in the following areas:     • Consensus around scientific and economic forecasts and further international  coordination and collaboration on the development of climate-risk models.   • Solutions to overcome a lack of relevant granular data and development of robust  climate-related financial risk model frameworks; and  • Collaboration between prudential and market regulators to mitigate any  unintended negative impacts on capital markets, including transition finance  market.                                                    
                                                                                       7    Conclusion     We appreciate the opportunity to submit our comments in response to the Principles for  Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We commend the  agencies for their consideration of these important issues. We look forward to the  issuance of further guidance relating to climate-related financial risks.

Truist  supports the FDIC’s efforts to develop principles-based guidance to assist financial institutions in  managing the possible impacts of physical- and transition-related risks associated with climate  change in a manner that is consistent with the existing risk management framework described in  the FDIC’s regulations and guidance.

    expanding its risk management teams and creating a dedicated climate risk management  function that seeks to identify and evaluate climate risks and opportunities, and to integrate  climate-related considerations into the Company’s risk management framework and strategic  plans.  We do this by developing business practices that protect and conserve natural resources  and reduce the carbon footprint of our own operations and that of our clients, as well as by  harnessing opportunities to invest in innovative new products, services, and partnerships in areas  such as renewable energy. Truist has also enhanced its climate-related reporting and  transparency.    Truist supports the development of principles-based guidance for climate-related  financial risk management. Truist further encourages the FDIC to continue coordinating with the  other bank regulatory agencies as well as broader governmental entities operating in this area to  ensure consistent requirements and supervisory expectations with respect to climate-related  financial risk management.   General Principles    Climate-related financial risks may impact financial institutions across the range of  traditional risk types and are likely to manifest in unique ways depending on each institution’s  size, complexity, operational footprint, business model, and strategy. The FDIC Proposal, in most  cases, establishes principles-based standards that allows FDIC-regulated banks to tailor their risk  management programs to the unique attributes of each institution.  As climate-related financial  risk management practices evolve and financial institutions develop processes to identify the  climate-related financial risk exposures from their business activities and operations, individual   banks should have the flexibility to tailor their risk management programs to address the unique  circumstances of each institution, including with respect to its size, business model, and client  portfolio.  Given the variances among FDIC-regulated banks’ size, geographic footprint, and  business models, the final guidance should clearly acknowledge that managing climate-related  financial risk should be risk-based and that “one size does not fit all.”     In addition, many FDIC-regulated banks are subject to regulation from other  governmental agencies, including prudential and financial market regulators, who are  contemplating or have proposed their own climate related requirements.  As the regulatory  landscape evolves, the opportunity for divergent regulatory frameworks grows rapidly absent  coordination among these governmental agencies.  Early analysis on the impact of climate- related financial risks suggests that the effects of climate risk can be observed through traditional 
    risk types.2  Given the interconnectedness of climate risk across risk types, it is imperative that  supervisory expectations for climate-related risk management are consistently developed and  applied, or banks may face the prospect of having to manage their climate-related financial risks  to differing regulatory standards, potentially requiring redundant and inconsistent compliance  requirements, resulting in increased costs and burden to the financial system as a whole without  corresponding benefits.  Governance     The proposed governance principles helpfully posit that the responsibility and  accountability for climate-related financial risk may be integrated within existing organizational  structures or by establishing new structures for climate-related financial risk.  Truist believes that  the flexibility this implies would allow institutions to properly design governance structures that  align with the way climate risks manifest within their institution.  However, the FDIC Proposal  also suggests that an institutions’ board of directors should have “an understanding of the  potential ways in which these risks could evolve over various time horizons and scenarios.”  Truist  believes the final guidance should recognize the complexity and uncertainty of planning over  longer time horizons, due to, among other things, the high number of scientific, macroeconomic,  financial, and other variables that can vary and must be taken into account when assessing  climate-related financial risk.  In addition, more quantitative and statistically-based aspects of  climate-risk management are in emerging stages, as many of the data points necessary to  accurately assess climate-related financial risk, even in the medium term, are simply unavailable  and there is substantial uncertainty with respect to the timing and scope of impacts of climate- related financial risk over medium- and longer-term time horizons.  Truist believes that  acknowledging that climate-related scenarios are less robust and predictable over long-time  horizons will encourage directors to obtain more information over longer time horizons and  enhance the usefulness of strategic planning over a longer time horizon.    Policies, Procedures, and Limits     Truist supports the proposal to incorporate climate-related risks into policies and  procedures to provide guidance on the institution’s approach to these risks that are in line with  the strategy and risk appetite set by the board of directors.  However, Truist does not believe  that it is appropriate to include formal “limits” for climate-related financial risks at this time.   Institutions should have the flexibility to assess their exposure to climate related risks, develop    2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels, Bank for  International Settlements,  https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf?msclkid=44a8db7bcff811ec85062206d907bb66 Accessed May 9, 2022 
    and inform their risk appetite and risk management frameworks prior to considering whether  any limits or thresholds would be appropriate.      The imposition of limits at this time could have unintended consequences, including  constraining the flow of capital and access to credit for certain industry segments and asset  classes, potentially exposing banks to additional legal and reputational risks.  Many energy- related firms seeking to transition away from higher-climate-risk activities will rely on financing  to achieve their business objectives, which very well could align with societal goals of reducing  climate-related risks.  Truist strives to serve its clients through their climate transition and the  imposition of arbitrary or premature limits could constrain Truist’s ability to do so.      Strategic Planning      Truist also supports the distinction between climate-related scenario analysis from  traditional stress testing exercises.  Truist agrees that scenario analysis can be an effective tool  in evaluating the resiliency of an institution’s strategy and risk management relative to the  structural changes arising from climate-related risks.  However, we believe the FDIC at the same  time should acknowledge that the relative immaturity of underlying data and methodologies may  limit the effectiveness of scenario analysis to accurately forecast potential impacts of climate  risks on a bank’s long-term strategy.      Risk Management    The proposal states that a financial institution should employ a comprehensive process  to identify emerging and material risks stemming from the institution’s business activities and  associated exposures.  While Truist agrees with the overall statement, we encourage the FDIC to  clarify that individual banks should develop a materiality standard for their use and application  in the risk appetite framework.  Truist believes that clarifying the meaning of “material” as  distinct from materiality in the context of securities laws provides banks with some comfort that  determinations made in the context of climate-risk management will not generate securities  liability.  Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting     Truist agrees that the climate-related financial risk information should be incorporated  into the institution’s internal risk reporting framework, including reporting, monitoring, and  escalation.  However, given the existing data challenges facing institutions, the extent of any  reporting should be commensurate with the capabilities and preferences of the institution. This 
    is not the case as climate change has the potential to manifest or drive risk within each of the  existing primary risk types.  As such, the final guidance should clearly state that climate risk does  not need to be treated as a stand-alone risk for reporting purposes.  Management of Risk Areas      The proposed principles further break out how banks should incorporate climate-related  financial risk across traditional risk types despite the previously acknowledged data limitations  limiting the ability of banks to effectively execute such an exercise.  Given the rapid development  of industry thinking and best practices on climate risk management and climate data collection  and analytic capabilities, any final guidance should provide sufficient flexibility for institutions to  develop, adopt, implement, and refine both (i) data capabilities and methodologies and (ii)  quantitative risk management tools that depend on that data, such as risk limits, risk appetites,  or scenario analysis.  These tools are instrumental to the application of the principles highlighted  in the management of risk areas section.     Other Comments on the Proposal  The FDIC Proposal states that “the manner in which financial institutions manage climate-related  financial risks to address safety and soundness concerns should also seek to reduce or mitigate  the impact that management of these risks may have on broader aspects of the economy.”  Truist  is concerned that this language may be read to imply a new, affirmative obligation for banks to  implement risk management activities in a way that mitigates the impact of its lending activities  “on broader aspects of the economy.”  Depending on the circumstances, such an obligation could  be at odds with a bank’s primary obligation to operate in a safe and sound manner, and present  boards of directors, management and regulators with contradictory mandates on a continuous  basis.  Truist encourages the FDIC to reconsider whether this kind of statement belongs in  prudential regulatory risk management guidance or is better left to elected policymakers.  Truist  also encourages the FDIC to coordinate with the other federal banking agencies regarding  concerns over broader economic impacts of climate-related financial risk management.   The FDIC’s proposal also requests comment on whether the federal banking agencies should  modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community  Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), to address the impact that climate-related financial risks may have on  low- and moderate income and other disadvantaged communities. Consistent with other  recommendations in this letter Truist encourages regulators modifying any existing regulations  to take measures to ensure they do not create a prescriptive regime that doesn’t reflect  variability across firms. Truist believes that there are multiple areas ripe for modification when  evaluating existing regulations and guidance to address climate-related financial risks on low- 
    and moderate income and other disadvantaged communities such as: i) clearly articulating which  types of activities, for both individual properties and large-scale community projects, would be  eligible for CRA credit; ii) ensuring transition externalities are addressed in a manner that  balances safety, soundness, and fairness through coordination and consultation with the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; and iii) coordination with the federal housing agencies  and government sponsored enterprises to improve other relevant federal programs, such as  flood insurance.

I am  writing to provide comments regarding the FDIC's statement of principles for climate-related financial  risk management for large financial institutions. I suspect that should these proposed requirements be  placed upon larger institutions it will only be a matter of time before smaller institutions will have  similar requirements.  I submit to you that the risk of ever-increasing regulation and the related expense, creates a much  greater risk to ru ral community banks than does climate change risk. As you know the tremendous  expense involved in complying with this regulation would be a huge burden on small community banks.  The banks which are the financial lifeblood of rural towns and communities are either being  consolidated into larger institutions or are closing branches in small towns partially due to the ever- increasing cost of regulation, leaving the people of these communities with the only option of driving  many miles to participate in the banking system .  Our small City of Hamilton, Alabama has a branch of a major nationwide banking institution. While that  institution is pleased to operate here and offer a myriad of checking accounts which provide that  institution with low-cost deposits to be utilized around the country, local individuals and small  businesses find it difficult to obtain loans at that institution. My point, obviously, is that without small,  local community banks, people in rural communities are going to be greatly harmed and unable to  participate in the financial system.  1281 Military Street South • P.O.

Climate change is ultimately ""weather"" which fluctuates and cycles over time within a fairly narrow  range. As high school students in the 1970's we observed that the climate scientists of the time were  predicting that t he earth was entering into the next ""ice age"". How wise would it have been to commit  millions and billions of dollars over the course of the past 50 years preparing for the risk associated with  another ice age?  We operate a branch in Hackleburg, Alabama, a small town that was almost totally destroyed in the  tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011. We were able to work with our customers in the aftermath of that  disaster and in t he years since the tornado the town has become better and stronger. Having witnessed  the devastation personally, I can attest that no amount of risk management would have reduced the  damage done by the F-5 tornado that day. In addition, many of our customers, operated heavy  equipment (fueled by diesel and gasoline) to clear the debris from the destruction and help residents  get on with their lives.  While I am pleased that this proposal is currently limited to banks of $100 billion or more in total assets,  I also know that many times, limited application regulations are ultimately applied to all banking  institutions.

Whitehead emphasizes that the cost of compliance could threaten the viability of rural community banks, which are crucial for local economies. He highlights the challenges faced by small towns like Hamilton, Alabama, where large banks do not adequately serve local lending needs. Whitehead questions the necessity of climate risk management, citing historical climate predictions that did not materialize, and argues that natural disasters, like the 2011 tornado in Hackleburg, Alabama, cannot be mitigated through risk management.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC  20429      Subject:   Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions (RIN 3064-ZA32)      Dear Mr. Sheesley and FDIC Board of Directors:    Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the FDIC’s statement of  principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I  am a Board Member and Executive Vice President of Jonah Bank of Wyoming.  Jonah  Bank of Wyoming is a $500 million community bank located in Casper and Cheyenne,  Wyoming.  We are a full-service financial institution and are well-positioned to meet the  financial service needs of our community.      Jonah Bank of Wyoming is also the only community bank in the region that focuses on  providing credit to small oil and gas producers.  With respect to our direct energy  portfolio, we have extended credit secured by production and mineral interests in  Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and  Nevada.  While this is a highly technical and specialized type of lending, our board  members and energy lenders have in excess of 100 years of combined experience in  providing credit to this industry.  Our direct energy portfolio represents approximately  10% of our overall commercial loan outstandings and 45% of tier-one capital.    Application of the Principles to Large and Small Banks    The Board of Directors and management of Jonah Bank of Wyoming have significant  concerns related to the proposed principles.  While we recognize the principles are  designed for financial institutions with assets in excess of $100 billion; invariably the  principles will trickle down to all banks.  I personally have observed this reality having  served as a state bank examiner and Deputy Banking Commissioner for over a decade.   Our community bank has experienced a large increase in oil and gas industry loan 
requests due to the social governance policies of larger institutions.  Should the FDIC  implement these new risk management principles, this industry will be driven even  further into the community bank space.  As this occurs, the risk concerns expressed for  large institutions will be shifted to smaller institutions.  Those who support these  additional risk management principles will turn their sites in our direction and request  expansion of the regulatory oversight.            Regardless of the size of the bank for which the princples are designed to apply, the mere  existence of such principles will result in yet another headwind to the oil and gas  industry.  The oil and gas industry is vital to the economic success and overall standard of  living in our country.  We are already experiencing the negative impact of the  implementation of unreasonable barriers (originating from different agencies in  Washington, DC) to the development of oil and gas resources.  As a result, the  development of new supplies of oil and gas are not keeping up with demand, and prices  have soared for these vital commodities.  The escalation in utility bills and the cost to  purchase fuel is negatively impacting household disposable income and  disproportionately impacts the quality of life for low and moderate income households.   There is no doubt the overall regulatory environment is the significant factor impacting  the development of new supplies of oil and gas.  Furthermore, uncertainty in the markets  caused by burdensome regulation and barriers to the maintenance of current production  levels is negatively impacting oil and gas employment.  This affects small communities  to a much larger degree than metropolitan areas, due to the vast majority of oil and gas  production being located in rural areas.  The proposed principles for climate-related  financial risk management will add to the problem and reduce the credit available to the  oil and gas industry, further exacerbating the issues that are already evident in our local,  state, and national economy.    Risk Management Practices    The principles are not specifically aimed at managing bank exposure to the oil and gas  industry.  While it will have a direct impact on the oil and gas industry, the proposed  framework is designed to require the implementation of a set of practices to manage  climate change risk more broadly.  This is unnecessary and will be burdensome.  Banks  have been managing risk for decades.  Existing risk management practices at community  banks are effective.  Community bankers know their customers and have been successful  in working with their customers to manage through droughts, natural disasters,  and  changes to industries that become obsolete.  None of this is new and community banks  have always managed these risks.  While it might be trendy to state that climate change is  new and different, it is not.  Compliance with a new climate-related  risk framework will  be expensive, duplicative of existing risk management practices, and unnecessary.      In addition to the proposed general risk management framework, the component of  scenario analysis should not become mandatory for a non-complex, low risk profile  community bank.  This analysis would be complex, expensive, and based on speculation.   Community banks are already well-positioned to manage economic shocks in our  communities and adding a scenario analysis component, especially related to climate risk,  would provide no value to our Board of Directors and management in the preservation of  our risk profile. 
  Conclusion    Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the proposed principles for  climate-related financial risk management.  In conclusion, we offer the following  recommendations:    • While the proposed principles are designed to apply to large banks, the existence  of such principles will impact the oil and gas industry and availability of credit to  that industry.  We recommend that the FDIC rely on existing risk management  frameworks that are proven effective, rather than implementing another broad and  speculative layer of additional burdensome requirements.  That said, should the  FDIC implement these principles for large banks, we recommend that the FDIC  ensure that the principles do not trickle down to smaller banks.  Adding additional  burden to small banks will result in further consolidation in the industry and the  loss of critical financial infrastructure for the extension of credit to small  businesses.  •  The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), in conjunction with the  regulatory agencies, should conduct a series of outreach meetings with community  bankers prior to instituting any supervisory guidance on climate risks. To ensure  that the community bank perspective is appropriately represented and that climate- risk regulation does not unfairly penalize or overburden community banks, we  recommend that FSOC include an individual with community banking experience  on its new Climate-Related Financial Risk Advisory Committee (CFRAC).  • Jonah Bank of Wyoming supports providing incentives to industries deemed to be  affected by climate change if such incentives reward current and future practices.  Such incentives could include carbon sequestration or other climate change  mitigation efforts that support the long-term use of oil and gas, which is the  cheapest, most abundant, and most reliable source of energy available.

Williams contends that the principles will shift risk management burdens to smaller banks, potentially reducing credit availability to the oil and gas industry, which is crucial for economic stability. He criticizes the proposed framework as unnecessary and duplicative, emphasizing that community banks already manage risks effectively. Williams recommends relying on existing risk management frameworks and suggests that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) engage with community bankers before implementing new regulations.

I devote my time now to the money question, and I am striving, with others, to ""end banking,"" banking defined as McMillan (2014) does as ""the creation of money out of credit"" (pp. 3, 6, 179; see also pp. 21, 31, 37, 56, 58, 113, 115, 140, 159, & 179). 
That is, we need much more out of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency than asking banks to track and account for the risks caused by climate change. We need to supersede what we currently use as money--which is private interest-bearing credit created by commercial banks via keystrokes when we agree to pay them that amount over time with interest--with a public asset created and spent, lent, given, or invested into circulation for the public good by the people through our democratically elected representatives. Doing so would eliminate the growth imperative that is leading to the climate change and environmental crises that your ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks"" are merely trying to account for. That is their shortcoming. It is too little too late. 
That said, these principles ARE needed and warranted today. They definitely need to be implemented not merely to secure the bottom line of the banks and of the people whose deposits reside under their auspices, but also to put attention on the detrimental consequences for all, including banks, of our blind and exploitive profit-driven practices that are polluting and destroying the natural environment and gift economy that, last I looked, you and I and all of us depend upon for our lives. 
But your new principles do not go far enough. Why are you only requiring banks to factor in the risks exacerbated by climate change rather than requiring them at least not to increase those risks by their investments and, preferably, to mitigate against them? It is not like the lives of your grandchildren and mine do not depend upon us stopping business as usual. They do. And the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is a public agency that can and should lead the way, and if--or when--existing law under the Federal Reserve Act gets in your way from stopping banks from creating via interest-bearing loans what we use as legal tender, then you must work to get Congress to change that law. Only then will your ""principles for climate-related financial risk management"" hold water and credibility with the 99%, not just of the US but of the global monetary system that, after WWII, we've made subservient to our Federal Reserve Note. 
Thank you for requesting public comment and considering mine.","The commenter, a retired professor of education, argues for a fundamental change in the monetary system, criticizing the current practice of banks creating money through credit. They advocate for replacing this system with a public asset model managed by democratically elected representatives to address climate change and environmental crises. The commenter believes the current ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks"" are insufficient, as they only require banks to account for climate risks rather than actively mitigate them. They urge the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to lead in reforming the monetary system and to push for legislative changes if necessary, emphasizing the urgency of these actions for future generations and global stability."

CFA advocates for legislative and administrative action to address the severe threats of climate change and the resulting serious economic, environmental, and public health consequences. Climate change presents substantial risks to banks, our financial system, and our economy, and many banks will benefit from clear, holistic guidance on assessing those risks. We support this important step toward addressing climate-related financial risks in the banking system and urge the OCC to meaningfully address all stakeholder concerns and questions, strengthen this draft, and develop principles that adequately address the existential and severe threat that climate change poses to our financial system. CFA is an association of non-profit consumer organizations that was established in 1968 to advance the consumer interest through research, advocacy, and education. Over 250 of these groups participate in the federation and govern it through their representatives on the organization’s Board of Directors. Our comments are based on CFA’s many years of experience advocating for consumer protections in the financial marketplace, protective financial and bank regulation, and affordable and fair access to financial services. 1. Climate Change is an Existential Threat to Our Financial System That the OCC and Other Federal Regulators Must Address The OCC is an independent bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks and thrift institutions, as well as federally licensed branches and agencies in the United States. The bureau’s work is extremely vital to the United 1
States and the banking sector, and it works closely with a variety of regulatory agencies. The OCC plays an important role in identifying and reducing financial risks. As the Federal Reserve,1 the Financial Stability Oversight Council,2 and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have written,3 climate change poses significant risks and challenges to our economy, financial system, and financial stability. It is critically important for the bureau, and other federal financial regulators, to assume a leading role. Climate change is already affecting the United States with more extreme weather and natural disasters,4 increasing surface temperature,5 and rising sea level,6 and these sweeping changes show no sign of easing.7 For example, analysis of satellite images dating back to 1979 shows that climate change is making hurricanes more intense and destructive. Now they are more likely to develop into a Category 3 storm or higher, with winds of at least 110 miles per hour.8 Additionally the U.S. Forest Service estimates that the fire season is two and a half months longer than in the 1970s, and wildfires are burning more acres than ever before.9 In 2021, over 40% of Americans lived in counties affected by climate disasters, which included flooding, mudslides, power outages, wildfires, drought, and heat waves.10 These natural disasters cause not only loss of life and property, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association reports the 1 “Climate Change Is a Source of Financial Risk.” By Glenn D.

U.S. has witnessed 310 weather and climate disasters since 1980 with damage or costs of $1 billion or more.11 Further, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) recently identified climate change as an emerging and increasing threat to financial stability. The Council stated that by collecting and publicly disclosing data, incorporating analysis of climate-related risks into supervisory and regulatory functions, and promoting disclosures of climate related risk, “financial regulators can both promote the resilience of the financial system and help it support an orderly, economy-wide transition toward the goal of net-zero emissions.”12 The risks to our financial system require further action beyond market forces and competition. Strong regulations are needed to ensure that banks adequately assess climate-related financial risks and are properly prepared for climate-related impacts, and that consumers are sufficiently informed of how climate change will affect their financial well-being. Although these principles are an important first step, the OCC also must encourage smaller banks to consider these risks and prepare for them, since smaller banks are more likely to feel the brunt of climate change’s effects. The OCC must also encourage the other financial regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), National Credit Union Association (NCUA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), to address climate related financial risks through their regulatory and supervisory actions as well. 2. Climate Change Will Disproportionately Hurt Low- and Moderate-Income Consumers and Communities of Color Low- and moderate- income (LMI) consumers, communities of color, and other financially vulnerable Americans are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change and climate- related financial risks. These consumers already feel the brunt of predatory financial practices, discriminatory policies, and systems that perpetuate existing disparities. In addition, these consumers have less access to safe and affordable credit or traditional financial services and therefore, are more likely to be unbanked and make use of nonbank financial services such as money orders, check-cashing services, and payday loans.13 11 “U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters.” NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. 2022.

Among banked consumers, Black and Latino consumers are more likely than white consumers to have incurred overdraft fees14 and are already harmed by lack of oversight and predatory practices. Although 18% of consumers reported overdrafting an account in December 2021, these rates are higher for underbanked consumers and those experiencing income volatility.15 High interest, short-term lenders specifically target and exploit Black communities– Black adults are more likely than white adults to live near payday lenders and pawn shops.16 Although credit cards can be a more affordable form of credit, Black consumers find it more difficult to obtain them.17 Additionally, Black and Hispanic households find it more difficult to gain approval for conventional mortgages, and when they are approved they tend to pay higher interest rates.18 This is partly due to the use of credit reports and scores, which both reflect and perpetuate large racial disparities and have a very real impact on consumers’ abilities to pay their bills.19 Finally, these systems and practices exacerbate the racial wealth gap– in 2019, the typical white family has five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family and eight times the wealth of a typical Black family. These consumers are also particularly vulnerable to the greatest impacts of climate change and will be the least able to prepare for and recover from the effects of climate change, including health, labor, and financial costs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently reported consumers of color and low-income consumers face disproportionate and unequal risks of the impacts of climate change, including the impacts that air quality and extreme temperature will have on health and labor hours; property damage and loss, and traffic delays due to island and coastal flooding.20 Consumers of color are most likely to live in areas with the highest projected impacts of climate changes.21 In addition, those consumers with low-income or no high school 14 “Amid Resurgence of Interest in Overdraft, New Data Reveal How Inequitable It Can Be.” Financial Health Network.

degree are more likely to currently live in areas with the highest projected losses of labor hours.22 Consumers of color and low-income consumers are disproportionately at risk to the highest health, labor, and property impacts of climate change. Further, these consumers also bear the brunt of financial instability and crises. As we learned from the 2008 financial crisis, the effects of financial crises are disproportionately felt by low23 and moderate-income consumers24 and communities of color.25 The result is a K-shaped recovery– following a recession, different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes– resulting in exacerbation of the existing wealth, homeownership, wage, and employment gaps. Climate change and the associated financial risks will disproportionately harm consumers of color and low-income consumers. Banks are not idle spectators to the anticipated effects climate change will have on our financial system and the consumers they serve. The OCC must be aggressive and proactive to address the ways in which bank activity might be fueling climate change and ensure that banks are adequately prepared for and addressing climate- related financial risks. Further, the OCC should pay particular attention to the ways in which vulnerable consumers will be disproportionately affected by climate-related risks; and through supervision of regulated entities, monitor how safety and soundness issues affect consumers of color low-income consumers, and other financially vulnerable consumers; ensure that physical banking access is expanded and not consolidated; and make certain that their activities are driving the financial stability of all consumers they serve. In addition, CFA shares the concerns raised by other consumer advocacy groups about the need for the OCC to consider the interaction between its climate supervision policies and fair lending. 3. CFA Recommends the Following: In order for banks to prepare for climate change and the associated risks, they must adopt good governance strategies, apply transparency, accountability, responsibility, and fairness in their business activities, and the OCC must facilitate these changes through mandatory requirements. 22 Id. 23 “Weathering the Recession: The Financial Crisis and Family Wealth Changes in Low-Income Neighborhoods.” By Leah Hendey, Signe-Mary McKernan, and Beadsie Woo.

Below are several recommendations that the OCC and banks should take regarding climate- related financial risks. The OCC Should Enact Mandatory Requirements for Considering Climate-Related Financial Risk and Cooperate with Other Agencies The OCC’s principles for climate-related risk financial managements provide an excellent framework for reducing risks and preparing for worst-case scenarios. But the principles are dependent upon the banks recognizing their significance and fully embracing them; if financial institutions are reluctant to implement the principles, they are of limited use. The OCC should therefore institute mandatory requirements to ensure large banks are adequately addressing climate related financial risk and incorporating the costs of carbon emissions into their financial strategies. For example, the OCC should require greater capital requirements to counter climate- related financial risk26 and in order to do that, climate change needs to be included in economic and financial forecasts and assessments of systemic risk.27 The OCC Should Work with Other Federal Agencies to Comprehensively Address Climate Related Financial Risk Interagency cooperation is essential to reducing climate-related financial risk and ensuring that banks are prepared for its adverse, multifaceted impacts. The OCC should work with the following organizations on various projects: ● The OCC should cooperate with the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to create a national effort to develop and implement mitigation and resilience standards and strategies to reduce exposure to climate change-driven risk.28 The effort should include how banks and insurance companies will contribute to such mitigation as part of their overall work. FIO and the OCC should also develop workstreams on insurance industry underwriting practices with climate impacts, how available and affordable insurance is and the likely impacts of climate change on that affordability, and develop federal and regional strategies to meet expanding capital needs for reinsuring major catastrophes and natural disasters. 26 “Addressing Climate-Related Financial Risk Through Bank Capital Requirements.” Center for American Progress.

● The OCC should coordinate with the deposit institution regulators, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), and state banking regulators, as well as the market regulators, Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), Office of Financial Research, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has established a climate working group.29 Together with these other regulators, the OCC can require that all financial institutions publicly disclose any assets that contribute to climate change, mitigate climate risks to their portfolios, and provide credit, physical banking access, and necessary financial services to communities facing the worst impacts of climate change. ● The OCC should further cooperate with other agencies, including but not limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to holistically address the impact of climate change on consumer financial well-being and security. In 2021, the CFPB established a climate working group to better assess the impact of climate change on consumer financial well-being and on the markets for consumer financial products and services. The working group will also examine the adverse impacts of climate change of historically underserved and disadvantaged communities and households–an obvious area of possible cooperation with the OCC.30 Banks Should Take a Holistic View of Climate Risk and Stakeholder Exposure The principles proposed by the OCC advance critical considerations for regulated banks. As such, they should be adopted and built upon with a broader view of climate-related financial risk management. Due to the size, organizational complexity, and economic footprint of large national banks, many of which are also public companies, these banks are unique among industry sectors in the context of climate change. Large banks are exposed to the climate-related risks of their own financial entanglements, and by extension their own stakeholders are exposed to the same. Because the physical and socioeconomic footprint of large national banks is so expansive,31 regulation of them should be tailored to capture the unique risks that they present, and this reality should be reflected in the OCC’s principles for climate-related risk management and subsequent regulations. On an institutional level, the complexities of large banks’ climate exposure risk should also be reflected in risk management governance, policies and procedures, and public disclosures. 29 “Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” FSOC, 2021, at 38. 30 Id. 31 “Are Banks Prepared for Climate Change?” Boston Common Asset Management., (2015). Available at https://bostoncommonasset.com/Membership/Apps/ICCMSViewReport_Input_App.ashx?IX_OB=None&IX_mId= 18&IX_RD=Y&ObjectId=731308, (“Banks are tied to every market sector through their lending practices, making them uniquely vulnerable to climate-related risk.”). 7
As the OCC develops principles and subsequent regulations for large banks, the view must be that a bank’s stakeholders include more than just physical assets, balance sheets, and shareholders. For these banks, and as discussed throughout this comment letter, the impacts of both good climate risk management and less-than-good climate risk management will have significant downstream impacts, and this will be especially true for those communities that are already the most vulnerable, both to the physical impacts of climate change and the financial impacts of instability in the financial system. As the OCC’s proposed principles state, “The board and management should also consider climate-related financial risk impacts on stakeholders’ expectations, the bank’s reputation, and LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products and services.” This statement should be a forethought for oversight, rather than an afterthought. The OCC’s RFI asks, “How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?” This question may or may not seek to impart the same meaning of the word “material” as does the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws,32 but hopefully not. To do so would unfortunately lead to a view that may dangerously narrow the climate-related considerations of banks’ risk management strategies and those which the OCC should incorporate into its oversight. Importantly, it is difficult to identify an industry sector that has more vulnerabilities or touch points to climate change as do large national banks,33 and to limit consideration and/or management of these unique vulnerabilities by way of a narrowed materiality analysis would be dangerous for banks, stakeholders, and the financial system writ large. The climate risks of one bank are likely to also spell climate risks for many others as well, and a narrowed view of material climate risks may therefore undermine the systemic view required of the OCC.34 Appropriately, the RFI asks, ""How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?” Here again, the RFI seems to appreciate the complex, multifaceted impacts that climate change poses for banks. As such, the OCC should certainly consider information that is financially material to regulated entities’ shareholders, that is “material” in the SEC/shareholder context, but only as one piece of the larger constellation of climate change risks that should be actively managed by banks, should 32 “Comment Letter Re: Public Input on Climate Change Disclosures.” Consumer Federation of America.

(“Of course, systemic risks don’t have to be catastrophic to be material.

be incorporated both into bank’s risk governance and strategic planning, and also codified in the OCC’s safety and soundness oversight and regulation. Banks Should Gather Expertise and Authority for Climate Scientists Banking institutions should possess substantial expertise on climate change and its impacts, both physical and financial. Knowledge about climate change is essential for making informed decisions and yet, too many banks are ignorant of this subject. Banks should be required to have climate scientists as members of their corporations and for these scientists to be given resources and authority so they can evaluate the impacts of rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather disasters, and other consequences of a warming plant. These positions should be substantive and possess the power to make real reforms, as opposed to surface level “greenwashing”— conveying a false impression or providing misleading information about how a company's products are more environmentally sound. Bank boards and management must also understand climate-related financial exposures and the vulnerability of their institutions. A few banks, including the European Central Bank and Lombard Odier, are competing to hire experts in order to gain knowledge and decarbonize their portfolios and loan books.35 Mounting evidence shows that climate change poses a serious threat to price stability and financial systems, and some institutions feel they require greater expertise. Although CFA appreciates Acting Comptroller Hsu’s identification of the following questions that bank boards should be able to adequately address, banks should impart their answers and work plans to address these concerns with the OCC: ● What is our long-term exposure to climate change, and how manageable is this exposure? ● Which counterparties, sectors, or locales need our heightened attention and focus? ● How vulnerable are our data centers and other critical services to extreme weather? ● What can we do to position ourselves to seize opportunities from climate change?36 Banks Should Divest from Climate Change Exacerbating Projects The OCC must ensure that public facing promises made by banks to divest from climate change exacerbating projects are met, and that through investment, banks are not further contributing to many of the industries that worsen climate change. For example, many banks finance activities 35 “Climate Scientists Swap Fieldwork for Finance.” By Simon Jessop, Carolyn Cohn, and Iain Withers. Reuters. April 15, 2021.

that further fuel climate change and are more likely to harm vulnerable consumers such as natural gas extraction, coal mines, and coal-fired power plants, and oil extraction and pipelines. From 2016 to 2020 the world’s 60 largest commercial and investment banks invested $3.8 trillion into fossil fuels.37 Banks must stop funding fossil fuel projects such as oil pipelines, natural gas-fired power plants, and coal-fired power plants, which emit greenhouse gas emissions and increase climate change. These projects lead to stronger hurricanes and wildfires, drought and heat waves, more frequent and extensive flooding, unusually hot or cold weather patterns, and rising sea levels, which lead to massive financial and human costs, as well as destruction of both personal property and public infrastructure. Therefore, the result is a self-fulfilling cycle of banks financing climate change, which contributes to financial instability while raising costs and creating greater exposure for the most vulnerable consumers. Despite making public facing promises to invest in clean, sustainable financing, some banks have been resistant to divest from fossil fuels.38 These actions are necessary in order to reduce climate change and transition to a lower-carbon economy. Banks must stop financing new fossil fuel projects and expanding existing projects. Further, they should start phasing out existing insurance and funding for them unless there are exceptional circumstances. Banks Should Prioritize Long Term Thinking and Analysis Traditionally banks and other financial institutions have prioritized shorter time horizons, profits, and immediate risks. While they examine past records and behavior, they make decisions based on immediate and near-future consequences. But investors, market participants, banks, and regulators all must consider the effects of climate change and its impact on risks over the long term. In comparison, insurance companies aim to distribute risk so that individuals and individual companies do not have to bear the full brunt of losses, by selling a diverse set of policies across a variety of markets. However large natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires can destroy or impact large areas and overwhelm insurers, possibly creating compounding losses. Climate change is making these cases more frequent, yet many insurers are underestimating the risks involved.39 Banks and other financial institutions must prioritize long term planning and legacies 37 “60 Largest Banks in the World Have Invested $3.8 Trillion in Fossil Fuels Since the Paris Agreement.” By Catherine Clifford.

over short term profits. They should consider circumstances and climate over the next twenty, thirty, or even fifty years, and make the necessary preparations. 4. Conclusion The OCC’s draft principles are an excellent beginning to addressing climate related financial risk. CFA urges that they be strengthened and adopted as quickly as possible. The banking industry, its regulators, and all consumers have a lot at stake, yet the burden of climate change and the financial risks will be disproportionately carried by consumers of color, LMI, and other vulnerable consumers. Climate change will impact every area of the financial sector and create dramatic risks, raising costs for everyone unless sweeping measures are adopted. We look forward to participating in this conversation going forward and offering feedback on OCC’s requirements for financial institutions. Please contact Rachel Gittleman (rgittleman@consumerfed.org) with any questions. 11","The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) submitted comments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regarding climate-related financial risk management for large banks. CFA supports the OCC's draft principles but urges stronger measures to address climate change's severe threats to the financial system. They emphasize that climate change poses significant risks to banks and the economy, advocating for mandatory requirements and interagency cooperation to manage these risks. CFA highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on low-income and minority communities, urging the OCC to ensure banks address these vulnerabilities. They recommend banks adopt long-term strategies, divest from fossil fuels, and incorporate climate expertise. CFA calls for transparency, accountability, and fairness in banks' climate risk management, emphasizing the need for comprehensive regulatory oversight to protect vulnerable consumers and ensure financial stability."

If we're to survive as a species we have to stop the generation of greenhouse gases, they trap heat and cause our planet to exhibit catastrophic events that are already devastating our lives and livelihoods.  You have the power to stop banks from funding the fossil fuels that are the recipe for our destruction.  Now is not soon enough","The comment draws a parallel between the historical divestment movement against apartheid in South Africa and the current need to divest from fossil fuels to combat climate change. The commenter argues that to ensure the survival of humanity, it is crucial to halt the generation of greenhouse gases, which are responsible for trapping heat and causing catastrophic environmental events. These events are already having devastating impacts on lives and livelihoods. The commenter urges action, emphasizing that financial institutions have the power to stop funding fossil fuels, which are seen as a major contributor to environmental destruction. The urgency of taking action is highlighted with the statement ""Now is not soon enough."""
