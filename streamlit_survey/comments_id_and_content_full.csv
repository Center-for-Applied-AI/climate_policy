kxa-gdxf-5l0y,"The OCC should not have regulations related to climate change as they affect banks.  This is no different than banks not having regulations how their investments are affected by sunspots, animal evolution, shifting consumer preferences, or other specific external factors.  External factors always come into play into any decision, and singling out climate change as one that rises to the importance of requiring a policy appears to be purely political and not related to any relevant century-long event that affects investments on the relatively short term time horizon that banks lend money or make investment decisions on.  And although these regulations would initially apply to only banks of larger than $100 billion, as we all know, regulation creep seems to percolate downward into smaller banks who are ill equipped to deal with an unnecessary burden amongst all other other regulatory burdens that are placed on them.","The commenter argues against the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) implementing regulations related to climate change for banks. They compare climate change to other external factors like sunspots and consumer preferences, suggesting that singling out climate change is politically motivated rather than based on its relevance to short-term investment decisions. The commenter believes that such regulations are unnecessary and could lead to regulatory creep, eventually affecting smaller banks that are less equipped to handle additional regulatory burdens."

This draft guidance for large banks represents a critical initial step in getting banks to manage and mitigate climate risks to their portfolios stemming from acute and chronic climate impacts, as well as the inevitable transition to a cleaner, more resilient economy. Importantly, the document explains how climate risk manifests across the traditional risk stripes considered by bank supervisors, and how banks should incorporate climate change into risk management, strategic planning, data collection and disclosure, and scenario analysis. The OCC, the Fed, the NCUA, and the FDIC should move forward quickly on detailed climate supervisory expectations for banks of all sizes. As an FDIC Board member also move expeditiously to advance climate guidance for that agency as well. Yours sincerely,

kxe-4g4t-gqnz,"Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks is not a bad beginning for a high-level principles document, but given the magnitude of the risks from climate change and the speed with which it is unfolding, much more detailed and proscriptive regulations are needed with urgency.  As a public citizen seeking to prepare for retirement, I find that banks and brokers are almost uniformly uninformed about the true nature and size of the threat from climate change.  Insurance instruments can deflect the risk but the Federal government is the insurer of last resort and young taxpayers will bear all the burden of paying for disaster recovery when the banks and insurers fail.  Banks of all sizes should be required to base their risk assessments on named scientific panels, bodies, and databases such as climatecentral.org’s surging seas floodmap.  FEMA’s floodmaps are drawn subject to input from biased entities such as local governemnt officials who have an interest in marketing their cities and counties.  That is why purely scientific databases should be the basis for risk assessments and decision-making.  In fact it would be best if regulatory bodies such as the FEC and OCC had climate scientists on staff participating in the oversight and evaluation of banks’ climate-related risk management policies.  As an example, I’ll wager that the banks and investors who have extended loans to the Kentucky candle factory that blew down in a tornado last week had no inkling that climate change substantially multiplies the number and size of tornadoes that will hit the southeastern US to the point where such occurences will be routine.  Banks have data scientists on staff already.  They need climate scientists and ecologists.","The comment critiques the ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks"" as insufficient given the urgent and significant risks posed by climate change. The commenter argues for more detailed and prescriptive regulations, emphasizing that banks and brokers lack awareness of climate threats. They highlight the role of the Federal government as the insurer of last resort, burdening young taxpayers with disaster recovery costs. The comment suggests that banks should base risk assessments on scientific data from sources like climatecentral.org, rather than biased inputs like FEMA's floodmaps. It advocates for regulatory bodies to include climate scientists in oversight roles, citing a recent tornado in Kentucky as an example of underestimated climate risks. The commenter calls for banks to employ climate scientists and ecologists alongside data scientists."

I. Introduction A. A GPS for net zero The world is rapidly committing to carbon neutrality or “net zero” by mid-century.1 The Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance is an UN-backed alliance of 25 institutional investors with $4.7 trillion assets under management committed to transition their investment portfolios to net- zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.2 BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $9 trillion in assets under management, is calling on all companies “to disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net-zero economy.”3 Last year, the firm voted against 69 companies and against 64 directors for climate-related reasons, while putting 191 companies “on watch.”4 To get to net zero on time we will need a global positioning system (GPS) to chart the course, show our past route of travel and current positioning, forecast our estimated time of arrival, and reroute us when we are off track. To guide us in the right direction this GPS must know the coordinates of our current position and our destination. It must measure and report our latitude and longitude, but in terms of climate transition risk and opportunity. And we must trust it. We must understand what it is telling us, and we must turn when it tells us to turn. Figuring out how to calculate the GPS coordinates for net zero is a critical challenge for corporate managers, asset owners, asset managers, commercial banks, central banks, and macroprudential authorities. New approaches that translate transition risks into forward- looking financial metrics are essential. Commercial and academic climate risk tools are increasing in their level of sophistication. But if the methodologies and outputs from these tools are not relevant and actionable by financial market actors, they will not be used to inform real-world financial decisions. They will not efficiently guide us to net zero. Financial and non-financial institutions face common challenges in the measurement of climate- related risks, including the need for metrics that account for the appropriate future time horizon and are practically relevant for mainstream risk management.5 A theoretical foundation and systematic approach towards meaningful climate risk metrics remains elusive.6 Existing climate risk tools can be difficult to interpret and use. They can also be systematically 1 See The Paris Effect: how the climate agreement is reshaping the global economy, (Box 1). 2 See Institutional investors transitioning their portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 for further details. 3 Larry Fink's 2021 letter to CEOs. 4 BlackRock Chief Pushes a Big New Climate Goal for the Corporate World, New York Times, Jan. 27, 2021. 5 Prudential Pathways: Industry Perspectives on Supervisory and Regulatory Approaches to Climate- related and Environmental Risks, Institute of International Finance (Jan. 2021). 6 Semieniuk, Gregor, Emanuele Campiglio, Jean-Francois Mercure, Ulrich Volz and Neil R. Edwards (2020), Low- carbon transition risks for finance, SOAS Department of Economics Working Paper No. 233, London: SOAS University of London. - 4 -
biased and fail to produce mutually consistent results. As a result, they often lack actionable relevance to financial decision-making.7 To meet the need for a net zero GPS, we are introducing a new transition risk tool set we call Carbon Quotient™ or “CQ” for short. The Carbon Quotient tool set measures the transition risk inherent in physical assets that are the source of carbon emissions. By tracking and forecasting progress toward net zero ambitions, CQ analytics are designed to increase accountability of financial institutions and corporate managers for doing their part to deliver emissions reductions in the real economy. B. The net zero accountability Imperative In principle, net zero means the owners of every emission-producing asset in the real economy will need to eliminate or offset emissions with a combination of low carbon replacements, energy efficiency improvements, and negative emissions. BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink is correct to say, “there is no company whose business model won’t be profoundly affected by the transition to a net zero economy.”8 For their part, asset owners, asset managers, and banks will need to measure and reduce the emissions of the companies and assets they finance. The transition to net zero must occur within the context of the principal-agent model in which agents carry out actions on behalf of principals. There are four key principal-agent pairings for getting to net zero – (1) beneficiaries-asset owners; (2) asset owners-asset managers; (3) asset managers-corporate managers; and (4) financial institution shareholders-financial institution managers.9 To reach net zero by 2050, there must be broad agreement among principals and agents on objectives, the economic barriers and constraints, how performance will be measured, and the consequences of success or failure. These views must also be translated into passively managed investments, which pose special challenges for accountability.10 Allocational efficiency, whereby capital is optimally distributed based on all available data, is a property of an efficient market. Passive funds have an implicit status quo bias that rewards incumbents. Passive investors therefore must rely on active investors to ensure allocational efficiency. Figure 1 illustrates how, as passive investment grows relative to active investment, the “tail starts wagging the dog”. 7 Taming the Green Swan: How to improve climate-related financial risk assessments, section 1 at p. 11. 8 Too many boardrooms are climate incompetent, Financial Times (Jan. 30, 2021). 9 See Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, section D. 10 See The Passives Problem and Paris Goals: How Index Investing Trends Threaten Climate Action and BlackRock Chief Pushes a Big New Climate Goal for the Corporate World, New York Times, Jan. 27, 2021. - 5 -
Presently, there is no broad consensus in any of these areas. The existing accountability framework is not working.11 Figure 1 The ""passive problem” A primary purpose of CQ analytics is to increase accountability across the entire investment value chain, which begs the question: accountable for what? This requires that we first explain our view on objectives, barriers and constraints. 11 See ClientEarth, Accountability Emergency: A review of UK-listed companies’ climate change-related reporting (2019-20). - 6 -
Figure 2 Net zero accountability framework Figure 2 shows our view of a net zero accountability framework. It starts with an agreed objective – carbon neutrality across the global economy by 2050. The primary barrier to achieving this objective is the world’s existing stock of carbon-intensive, long-lived tangible assets and the need to replace them with low carbon alternatives on an accelerated schedule. The primary constraint is that corporate managers must make this transition while maintaining an acceptable level of profitability. Once objectives, barriers, and constraints are commonly understood and agreed, the measurement system used to assess agent performance must properly account for the key variables that are within the agent’s powers – capital allocation, emissions reductions, and profitability – recognizing that there are conflicting objectives that must be reconciled. If principals and agents can properly measure and report performance against these criteria, they will have a chance of achieving them. If they cannot, they will flounder. - 7 -
C. Preconditions for accountability Within the financial principal-agent model in Figure 2, the basic relationships consist of the granting or withholding of power and capital (consequences) by the principal. The agent then carries out actions on behalf of the principal and reports results.12 Figure 3 Principal-agent accountability cycle Accountability requires that agents measure and report the right things in a way that principals can and will act on. Measurement for measurement’s sake, without consequences, is illusory. It is the appearance of accountability where there is none. It is noise not signal, or worse, greenwash and paper tigers. Today, financial regulators face the same accountability challenges that investors do.13 For there to be true accountability, accounting for transition risk must become more like financial accounting.14 If agents fail to measure and report the right things, there is the possibility that independent third parties can do so. In addition to compensating for a lack of self-reporting by agents, third party reporting enables comparative measurement – everyone can see how everyone else is performing relative to themselves and others. 12 See Accountability, Accounting Regulation and the Principal Agent Model. 13 “When companies report climate-related disclosures in varying formats, [U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission] reviewers and investors may find it difficult to navigate through the filings to identify, compare, and analyze the climate-related disclosures across filings, especially given the size of each individual filing.” GAO-18-188. 14 Karthik Ramanna, Professor of Business & Public Policy and Director of the Master of Public Policy Program at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, ESG accounting needs to cut through the greenwash, Financial Times, 17 Jan. 2021. - 8 -
A functional principal-agent-third party accountability cycle (as shown in Figure 4) requires that independent analysts external to the principal-agent relationship have access to the data required to produce measurements that principals can and will act on. If the necessary data (e.g., emissions data) is not self-reported and independently verified, independent analysts must be able to produce and publish sufficiently reliable data themselves. The data must be developed using observable inputs and objective methodologies or it will not be trusted by market actors. This imposes practical limitations on third party accountability measurement and reporting. Performance measures that rely on unobservable data inputs and subjective methodologies will not improve accountability. Figure 4 Principal-agent-third party accountability cycle Accountability must apply to financial and non-financial actors across the investment value chain (Figure 5) – not just to corporate managers in the real economy. To meet their own fiduciary duties to their clients and beneficiaries, investors too must use their existing legal rights and powers to hold companies, directors and auditors accountable.15 Ideally, the measurement and reporting framework should assess the performance of all actors – asset owners, asset managers, corporations, and financial institutions – against the same yardstick. Holding all actors accountable for the same performance metric would facilitate accountability across the entire investment value chain. 15 See ClientEarth, Accountability Emergency: A review of UK-listed companies’ climate change-related reporting (2019-20). - 9 -
Figure 5 Investment value chain The following sections describe the new CQ tool set, how it performs against criteria for an effective net zero accountability framework, its relationship to other climate finance measures and initiatives, use cases, and methodology. II. The Carbon Quotient tool set The Carbon Quotient tool set comprises a set of concepts, formulas, processes, data, data visualization tools, and quantitative analyses designed to help financial actors and corporate managers allocate capital for optimal long-term risk-adjusted returns. Its major components are – (1) the Carbon Quotient ratio; (2) risk-adjusted financial accounts and ratios; and (3) the net zero GPS. The Carbon Quotient ratio is defined as: 𝑈𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛 𝑄𝑢𝑜𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡 = 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 where Unrealized Carbon Expense is unrealized emissions (tCO e) times an imputed 2 carbon price ($/tCO e); 2 Unrealized emissions are future greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e) that will result from the continued use of emission-producing physical assets over their remaining life, calculated as current period realized emissions times asset life; and Assets is the carrying value (cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization) of emission-producing physical assets. Mitigating unrealized emissions from long-lived assets is like turning an aircraft carrier. You need to start the turn long before it is to be completed. The power of net zero is that it sets a - 10 -
common destination and deadline. Wherever one starts the journey, the destination is the same. So is the deadline. This means we know when to start turning and how fast to turn the wheel. It is self-evident but nonetheless worth stating that anthropogenic carbon emissions do not produce themselves. Long-lived tangible assets do. Examples of long-lived tangible assets, sometimes referred to as real, fixed or physical assets, include land, buildings, machinery and equipment, and vehicles.16 Examples of carbon- intensive real assets include fossil fuel reserves, coal and natural gas power plants, internal combustion and jet engines (and the factories that produce them), aluminum and cement plants, commercial and residential buildings, and land. These assets appear on the balance sheets of corporations as “property, plant, and equipment.” By definition, long-lived tangible assets have useful lives greater than one year. Emission-producing long-lived tangible assets may be off-balance sheet for a particular entity. For example, scope 2 emissions (i.e., indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy consumed by the reporting company) are generated by assets upstream of the entity. By definition, scope 3 emissions occur from sources owned or controlled by other entities in the value chain, either upstream or downstream. Accounting for indirect emissions from off- balance sheet assets is important to fairly present an entity’s Carbon Quotient ratio. The redirection of capital toward decarbonization requires that investors understand and account for the future climate impact of the world’s existing stock of emission-producing real assets. Carbon emissions result from the use and operation of long-lived tangible assets. Whereas intangible assets are today responsible for an increasing share of corporate value,17 tangible assets retain their dominance as the principal source of carbon emissions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the primary sources of emissions in the United States are transportation (28 percent), electricity production (27 percent), industry (22 percent), commercial and residential buildings (12 percent), agriculture (10 percent), and land use and forestry (12 percent).18 These sectors have a common characteristic: they are all capital-intensive. Because emission-producing real assets have estimated useful lives more than one year, often measured in decades, the climate impact of these assets is greater than the emissions realized from their use in a single year. The climate impact of real assets lies in the “unrealized” future emissions that will result from their continued use over their remaining useful lives. This has important implications for capital investment decisions in the real and financial economy. 16 CFA Curriculum | Financial Reporting and Analysis | Long-lived-assets. 17 Baruch Lev, The End of Accounting and the Path Forward for Investors and Managers (Wiley, 2016) 18 U.S. EPA: Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions. - 11 -
The following chart shows the average technical lifespan of energy-related real assets.19 Figure 6 Average technical lifespan of energy-related capital stock The remaining useful lives of much of the world’s stock of emission-producing assets extend to 2050 and beyond. Reducing unrealized emissions on a timeline consistent with the Paris Agreement will require the early retirement and replacement of many of these assets. New investments in carbon-intensive assets will be at even greater risk. Asset impairment, asset stranding, and early replacement costs are the central financial and economic challenge of net zero. An organization’s climate resilience is correlated with its long-lived tangible assets. Aircraft carriers turn, brake, and accelerate slowly compared to speed boats. They are less adaptive to rapid change. Businesses dominated by long-lived carbon-intensive assets have less adaptive capacity. To survive the transition to net zero, these organizations must successfully seize opportunities to improve efficiency, design new production processes, and develop new products. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has observed that, “Opportunities related to resilience may be especially relevant for organizations with long-lived fixed assets.”20 This is another way of saying that capital-intensive businesses with carbon-intensive assets are especially at risk. CQ analytics internalize costs for realized (current and past) and unrealized (future) emissions. Emissions are a byproduct of a company’s operations with externalized environmental and social costs that fall outside GAAP/IFRS reporting. Future regulatory efforts to curtail emissions 19 Carbon Tracker, Decline and Fall: The Size & Vulnerability of the Fossil Fuel System. 20 TCFD Final Report, Section B.2.d at p. 7. - 12 -
are expected to internalize these impacts, if only partially, as a business cost. Increased carbon costs will reduce profitability, expected future cash flows, and asset valuations. The Carbon Quotient ratio can be applied to all asset classes covered by the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, including listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted equity, project finance, commercial real estate, mortgages, and motor vehicle loans.21 CQ analytics also produce risk-adjusted financial accounts (e.g., assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and cash flows) and ratios (e.g., profit margin, asset turnover, return on assets, etc.) that account for the externalized costs of realized (past and current) and unrealized (future) emissions. III. Accountability measurement An effective net zero accountability framework (Figure 4) requires measurements that: • Assess past performance against agreed objectives, barriers and constraints – i.e., measurements must be relevant and actionable. • Provide a reasonable basis for forecasting future performance. • Produce consistent measurements from one organization to another and from one period to another. • Integrate with financial accounting frameworks (GAAP/IFRS). • Assure that reported measurements are what they purport to be and are free of material error or fraud. • Are as simple as possible. Principals across the investment value chain can and will act on measurements with these qualities, displacing measurement for measurement’s sake without consequences. A. Relevant and actionable An effective accountability framework must measure and report information to assess performance against agreed objectives, barriers and constraints. In other words, performance measurements must truly inform investment decisions. They must be relevant and actionable. They must have consequence. In this case, the term “net zero” itself defines the primary objective. The constraint is that this objective must be achieved while maintaining an acceptable level of profitability. The principal barrier is that to achieve net zero, actors in the real economy must replace much of the world’s existing stock of emission-producing assets with low carbon alternatives on an accelerated schedule. In his Tragedy of the Horizon speech, Mark Carney explained transition risk by saying that if the carbon budget estimate of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is even 21 PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry. - 13 -
approximately correct it would render the vast majority of fossil fuel reserves stranded, but there was a flipside of transition risk – the opportunity of a sweeping reallocation of resources and a technological revolution, with long-term infrastructure investments at roughly quadruple the present rate.22 In sum, transition risk and opportunity each arises from the need to accelerate replacement of the world’s existing stock of carbon-intensive assets with low carbon alternatives. One of the essential functions of financial markets is to price risk to support informed, efficient capital allocation decisions. The Financial Stability Board, then chaired by Carney, established the TCFD in 2015 to identify the information needed by investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters to appropriately assess and price climate-related risks and opportunities, both those arising from physical impacts and the energy transition. The purpose of CQ analytics is to help corporate managers, investors and lenders assess and price transition risks and opportunities. Understanding how CQ analytics measure transition risk is important for users to correctly interpret its outputs. The elements of risk assessment include hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and impact (probability times severity). The principal hazards associated with the transition to net zero are policy changes (carbon taxes and constraints), market shifts (supply chain and consumer demand), technology developments, and legal liability. Of these, the root hazard is policy change and its potential impact on carbon emissions and prices. Market and technology risks are largely derivative from policy risk. Expectations of an inevitable policy response are a principal driver for technology development and market shifts. Litigation risk is also correlated with policy based on proximate causation: emissions cause climatic warming which exacerbates physical hazards which impose added adaptation and response costs on others. Sectors and firms with higher emissions bear higher exposure to policy changes and are also likely to bear higher exposures to market, technology, and legal hazards. Concerned that a systematic approach and a comprehensive theory on climate-adjusted financial risk metrics is still missing, the Center of Economic Research at ETH Zurich drew on insights from climate science, economics and finance research, to derive a set of important criteria to ensure that climate risk tools provide high quality, comparable, and decision-relevant results.23 Table 1 describes how CQ analytics account for the various elements of transition risk using the ETH Zurich criteria. 22 Breaking the tragedy of the horizon – climate change and financial stability, Speech by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at Lloyd’s of London, London, 29 September 2015. 23 Taming the Green Swan: How to improve climate-related financial risk assessments, section 4.2 at pp. 28-33. - 14 -

Forward-looking An effective accountability framework must provide a reasonable basis for forecasting future performance. Investors cannot navigate the unchartered course to net zero looking only in the rear-view mirror. Past emissions, and carbon intensity measures derived from past emissions, tell us little about where we are headed and where we need to go. The net zero imperative calls for new instruments to help investors spot hazards around corners ahead. We need a global positioning system (GPS) to keep us on course. - 15 -
The TCFD has indicated growing interest in forward-looking climate risk measurements to inform financial decisions.24 In June 2021 the TCFD opened a public consultation on proposed guidance on climate-related metrics, targets, and transition plans25 and the Portfolio Alignment Team's Technical Supplement26 to learn more about the potential usefulness of climate-related metrics in promoting comparability across financial disclosures and to receive feedback on the proposed changes to climate-related targets and transition plans. Forward-looking metrics that focus on physical risk and asset valuations are starting to emerge. However, as tools for financial decision-making, these metrics have many shortcomings.27 Three in four respondents to a recent TCFD consultation reported unease with the methods used to create forward-looking portfolio metrics.28 Asked what challenges their organizations faced using metrics like portfolio warming potential and climate value-and-risk, 77% of respondents in the financial services industry said “concerns around reliance on assumptions required to derive future company-level emissions” and 74% said “concerns around reliance on assumptions and future uncertainty.” Fortunately, there is a simple and objective way to estimate future company-level emissions, based on past transactions and events . Carbon Quotient analytics address the need for objective forward-looking measures of transition risk in two ways: (1) accounting for unrealized (future) emissions; and (2) creating a net zero GPS. The CQ methodology enables investors to “trust but verify” corporate statements about future plans and prospects. 1. The future that has already happened Investors need forecasts based on minimal speculation. Although it is impossible to predict the future, it is both possible and fruitful to identify major events that have already happened and that will have predictable effects in the future. In other words, to achieve net zero, investors should identify and prepare for the future that has already happened. Investors should ask what are major events that have already happened that will have long- term future climate-related impacts and what are the predictable effects of these events over the next several decades? CQ analytics answer these questions as follows: 24 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Forward-Looking Financial Sector Metrics Consultation, October 2020. 25 TCFD Proposed Guidance on Climate-related Metrics, Targets, and Transition Plans. 26 TCFD Portfolio Alignment Team's Technical Supplement. 27 Scientists have expressed concern that physical risk models used by climate scientists may be inappropriately deployed by institutions and climate service providers and produce unreliable financial signals.

What are major events that have already happened that will have long-term future impacts? The acquisition, construction and development of the world’s existing stock of emissions-producing long-lived tangible assets. What are the predictable effects of these events over the next several decades? The “unrealized” future emissions that will result from the continued use of these assets over their remaining economic lives. Figure 7 The future that has already happened 2. Unrealized emissions The TCFD describes the value of past emissions data this way: Although still useful for decision-making, past carbon exposures provide little insight into potential future exposure. This is particularly the case as a growing number of companies are announcing planned changes to products, strategies, and future emissions targets in line with international climate agreements and national policy goals. Although past carbon emissions are not a measure of future exposure, they do provide a great deal of insight into potential future exposure. This is because the long-lived assets that produced those past emissions – unless replaced or modified – will also produce tomorrow’s emissions. - 17 -
It is possible to estimate future emissions by accounting for the remaining economic life of existing emission-producing assets.29 Instead of looking backwards, CQ analytics measure the unrealized emissions that are already “baked in” to existing assets in the real economy. Net zero by 2050 is a stretch goal but not a fantasy. A recent study from Princeton University30 found that with a massive, nationwide effort the United States could reach net zero by 2050 using existing technology and at costs aligned with historical spending on energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reached a similar conclusion.31 But there is a catch. Net zero by 2050 is attainable only if we “immediately shift investments toward new clean infrastructure instead of existing systems.”32 . A key assumption in net zero projections is timing – when carbon-intensive real assets will be replaced – whether at economic end-of-life, which reduces replacement costs, or prior to economic end-of-life, which would leave some assets impaired or stranded. Transition risk is directly correlated with asset replacement costs. This has two important implications – (1) new investments in carbon-intensive assets are at higher risk of becoming impaired or stranded; and (2) delay in the reallocation of investment toward decarbonization increases the risk of existing carbon-intensive assets becoming impaired or stranded as the remaining timeframe for decarbonization is compressed. Asset impairment risk arising from the transition to net zero is a function of future emissions over the remaining economic life of the asset.33 Assets with higher emissions and longer lives have higher unrealized future emissions and are at greater risk of becoming impaired or stranded. Because a carbon pricing scheme is not a reality today, CQ analytics measure a latent threat to uncertain future cash flows. Nonetheless, as illustrated in Figure 8 (reproduced from the final TCFD recommendations), climate-related impacts on expected future cash flows can have immediate financial consequences. 29 Taming the Green Swan: How to improve climate-related financial risk assessments, section 4.2 at p. 32. 30 Princeton University, Net Zero America: Potential Pathways, Infrastructure, Impacts Interim Report. 31 International Energy Agency, Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector. 32 Big but affordable effort needed for America to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, Princeton study shows, quote from project lead Jesse Jenkins, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment. 33 Relevant emissions may include value chain (scope 3) emissions. - 18 -
Figure 8 Climate-related risks, opportunities and financial impact Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), forward-looking expectations can adversely affect a company’s balance sheet – e.g., through asset impairments, accelerated asset retirement obligations, and contingent liabilities.34 In its final report, the TCFD observed: Use of long-lived assets and, where relevant, reserves may be particularly affected by climate-related issues. It is important for organizations to provide an indication of the potential climate-related impact on their assets and liabilities, particularly long-lived assets. This should focus on existing and committed future activities and decisions requiring new investment, restructuring, write-downs, or impairment.35 3. GPS mapping for net zero The power of net zero is that its sets both a destination and a deadline. Wherever one starts the journey, the destination is the same – carbon neutrality. So is the deadline. This means one can create a customized map for getting to net zero on time, track progress, and forecast an estimated time of arrival (ETA) for any emission-producing asset or portfolio of emission- producing assets. The road to net zero will be fraught with failures but also sprinkled with successes. Some firms will fail along the way. Others will survive and prosper. If they are to efficiently allocate capital, 34 See Effects of climate-related matters on financial statements; Accounting for climate: Integrating climate-related matters into financial reporting, and Rogers, Financial Reporting of Environmental Liabilities and Risks after Sarbanes-Oxley (Wiley, 2005). 35 TCFD Final Report at Figure 2 Major Categories of Financial Impact, p. 9 [emphasis added]. - 19 -
investors must have a GPS to track who is on course and who is not, who is winning and who is losing, who should get more capital and who should get less. CQ analytics produce risk-adjusted financial accounts and ratios that reflect the economics of net zero and correlate realized and unrealized emissions with the real assets that produce them. The GPS maps a course for getting to net zero, shows past course of travel and current positioning, and gives an ETA. When the current course is off track, it shows the degree of rerouting needed to get back on course. Figure 9 below is an example of a net zero GPS. Once Carbon Quotient calculations are complete, the results can be plotted on a timeline starting at a selected point in the past (e.g., 2010) and extending through a target date for reaching net zero. The data visualization includes the following five key components: • The Carbon Quotient ratio (y axis) • Relevant timeframe (x axis) • An asymptotic exponential trajectory to net zero by a selected target date • Actual CQ results for past periods (the difference between actual performance and the net zero trajectory is a visual representation of asset impairment risk) • A trend line forecast through the selected net zero target date Figure 9 Net zero GPS diagram C. Comparative measurement An effective accountability framework must measure and report information that principals can use to assess the performance of one agent against another and by the same agent over time. Considerations include the measurement scale, the unit of measurement, and estimation uncertainty. Warning, the following discussion is technical but essential. Measurement lies at the heart of accountability. There are many different ways to measure climate-related financial risk. This section explains the difference in measurements and the difference it makes. - 20 -
1. Measurement scale To facilitate comparative measurement, the measurement scale should allow any analyst to compare proportional differences in outputs for different assets, companies or portfolios. Of the four measurement scales – nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio – only the ratio scale is suitable. Notably, many existing measures of climate risk do not use ratio scale variables. a) Nominal scale Nominal scales are used for labeling variables, without any quantitative value. Nominal scales could simply be called labels. Sub-types of nominal scale include dichotomous data with only two categories (e.g. male/female or yes/no) and nominal with order (e.g., cold, warm, hot, very hot). The Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark is an example of a dichotomous nominal scale.36 The framework assesses focus companies based on their publicly disclosed information. It includes eight yes/no indicators (and several sub-indicators): 1. Whether the company set an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner 2. Whether the company has set long-term reduction targets 3. Whether the company has set medium-term reduction targets 4. Whether the company has set short-term reduction targets 5. Whether the company has a decarbonization strategy 6. Whether the company is working to decarbonize its future capital expenditures 7. Whether the company has a Paris-Agreement-aligned climate lobbying position and all of its direct lobbying activities are aligned with this 8. Whether the company’s board has clear oversight of climate change Notably, all eight criteria are qualitative and non-financial. They offer a range of indicators that investors can use to inform investment decisions and stewardship, but they do not provide a quantitative means to track a firm’s progress toward net zero over time. The most important criteria – whether companies have a robust strategy to achieve net zero emissions targets and whether they are aligned with the Paris Agreement – are highly subjective, making objective comparison impossible. The criteria cannot be processed and manipulated in a computerized system and cannot be rolled up for investment portfolios. b) Ordinal scale Ordinal data is quantitative data with naturally occurring orders but where the difference between values is unknown. Ordinal scales typically measure qualitative concepts like satisfaction, happiness, and discomfort (e.g., 1- Totally Satisfied, 2- Satisfied, 3- Neutral, 4- Dissatisfied, 5- Totally Dissatisfied). 36 Climate Action 100+ Net-Zero Company Benchmark. - 21 -
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores are examples of ordinal scale. ESG indicators are usually in the form of quantitative ratings, that is, they show the ESG performance on a pre-defined numeric scale (e.g., 1 to 100), representing a range from low to high ESG performance or from high to low ESG risk. The difference between a rating of 80 and 60 is not exactly the same as the difference between a rating of 40 and 60. Nor is the difference between a rating of 40 and 80 exactly twice the difference between a rating of 40 and 60. Many ESG scores also use a best-in class ranking within sectors. This results in high scores for some oil and gas companies relative to their peers, even though the oil and gas sector is the largest source of direct and indirect GHG emissions.37 This further confounds the analyst’s ability to discern the difference between values and to assess portfolio risk. c) Interval scale Interval scales are numeric scales that provide both the order and the exact differences between the values. Temperature is an example of an interval scale variable. If an air- conditioned room is 16 C and the outside temperature is 32 C, the outside temperature is exactly 16 C higher, but it is not twice as hot outside than inside. Implied temperature rise (ITR) is an example of an interval scale variable for measuring transition risk. ITR estimates a company’s expected future emissions and translates this into a projected increase in global average temperature warming that would occur if all companies in corresponding sectors had the same carbon intensity as the selected target. The ITR metric is expressed in a single temperature unit or range that is comparable to widely understood potential climate outcomes (e.g., 1.5°C, 2°C, 3.5°C).38 ITR is used to assess the alignment of a portfolio with a particular transition pathway.39 A 1.5°C- aligned portfolio is exactly 2°C apart from a 3.5°C-aligned portfolio. However, it would be meaningless to say that 2.5°C-aligned portfolio is exactly twice as aligned with a 1.5°C transition pathway as a 3.5°C-aligned portfolio. d) Ratio scale Ratio scale variables provide order and the exact value between units. Also, because they have an absolute zero, they allow a wide range of statistical analysis. Age, money, and weight are common ratio scale variables. A 60-year old person is both 30 years older than a 30-year old and twice as old. 37 Climate Strategies and Metrics: Exploring Options for Institutional Investors. 38 BlackRock has announced its intent to publish “a temperature alignment metric for our public equity and bond funds, where sufficient data is available.” Larry Fink's 2021 letter to CEOs. 39 See Measuring Portfolio Alignment: Assessing the position of companies and portfolios on the path to net zero and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Forward-Looking Financial Sector Metrics Consultation, October 2020. - 22 -
The true zero characteristic of ratio scale variables is an essential factor in calculating financial ratios commonly used by investors and analysts. These include liquidity ratios, leverage ratios, profitability ratios, efficiency ratios, coverage ratios, and market prospect ratios.40 Ratios are a cornerstone of fundamental equity analysis because they enable reliable comparative measurement. CQ analytics use only ratio scale variables – emissions and money. A company with emissions of 100 tCO e/year has exactly twice the emissions of a company with emissions of 50 2 tCO e/year. A company with carbon-adjusted net income of $100 million has exactly twice the 2 adjusted net income of a company with carbon-adjusted net income of $50 million. Similarly, a portfolio with a Carbon Quotient ratio of 100% bears exactly twice the transition risk, as measured by the CQ ratio, of a portfolio with a 50% Carbon Quotient ratio. 2. Unit of measurement Measurement requires either a standardized unit of measurement (e.g., dollar, year, ton, and degree Celsius) or a reference standard (e.g., a tuning fork). The Carbon Quotient ratio is a standardized unit of measurement for quantifying the transition risk inherent in emission-producing, long-lived tangible assets. It allows users to easily and rationally assess the differential risk in one asset (or portfolio of assets) to another without regard to whether the absolute risk of either can be known with reasonable assurance. Other standardized units of measurement used to quantify transition risk include emission intensity ratios that calculate the relationship of emissions to corporate revenues, production levels, and investment. The most popular standardized unit of measurement for portfolios is the weighted-average carbon intensity (WACI) ratio. A comparison of CQ analytics to other carbon metrics is provided in the section on “Comparison to other carbon ” below. Portfolio alignment measures, such as implied temperature rise and the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA)41 scenario alignment tool developed by 2° Investing Initiative, use a reference standard (e.g., a 1.5°C-aligned portfolio) to assess transition risk. A drawback to such measures is the absence of ratio scale. 3. Estimation uncertainty In general, measurements are only an approximation or estimate of the value of the quantity measured and thus are complete only when accompanied by a statement of the uncertainty of the estimate. Climate-related financial risks are subject to extreme uncertainty. Global climate change is unprecedented. Climate-related risks are characterized by deep uncertainties, interdependences, non-linearity, and fat tails. Outcomes and timing cannot be predicted with reasonable assurance. Rather than waiting for ever more accurate climate risk 40Investopedia | Ratio Analysis. 41 2° Investing Initiative| Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA). - 23 -
models, practical actors in the real and financial economy must instead ask, ""what is the correct decision today assuming we have no reliable models of climate risk, because we don’t?""42 Measurements can be direct (absolute) or indirect (comparative). Absolute measurements measure the quantity of a target (asset, company, portfolio) against a standardized unit of measurement or reference standard. Comparative measurements gauge the difference between two or more targets. Where estimation uncertainty is high comparative measurements may be more accurate and decision useful than absolute measurements. As illustrated in Figure 10, the relative size of two children or the relative height of a child from one year to the next can be quickly ascertained with much greater accuracy than the absolute size of either. Figure 10 Comparative measurement This is because comparative measurements eliminate many systematic errors that reduce the accuracy of direct measurements. Systematic errors are those that occur consistently in all measurement regardless of repetition. Systematic errors can arise from data (e.g., emissions estimates), assumptions (e.g., carbon prices, baseline and transition scenarios), or complex methodologies used to account for uncertainty and non-linearities (or the decision to instead ignore them). As measurement approaches for transition risk increase in sophistication, users may expect that they will become more accurate and decision-useful, but the opposite could be true. As methodologies become more complex, they also become more vulnerable to systematic errors. As a result, more sophisticated measures of transition risk may create the illusion of precision and accuracy while delivering estimates that are neither (see Figure 11). 42 Joseph Norman, Rupert Read, Yaneer Bar-Yam, and Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Climate models and precautionary measures, Issues in Science and Technology (Summer 2015). - 24 -
Figure 11 Random and systematic errors in measurement In practical terms, this means that absolute measurements of transition risk – e.g., the climate- adjusted valuation for company X is Y (based on, for example, climate value at risk) – are not sufficiently reliable to inform investment decisions. They may be relevant, but they are not actionable. Comparative measurements (benchmarking), on the other hand, may have high decision utility by differentiating leaders from laggards on a standard scale. D. Integration with accounting frameworks An effective accountability framework must measure and report information that can be easily incorporated into financial accounting frameworks (GAAP/IFRS) used in fundamental equity analysis. This requires that the framework have several attributes. For example, measurements of transition risk must be expressed in monetary terms. This requires monetization (pricing) of emissions. We discuss those below. 1. Risk-adjusted financial accounts and ratios The Impact-Weighted Accounts Project at the Harvard Business School attempts to comprehensively account for social and environmental impacts, CQ analytics focus more narrowly on the social and environmental imperative of our time: climate change. The mission of the Harvard project is to create accounting statements that transparently capture external social and environmental impacts in a way that drives investor and managerial decision making. The initiative is based on the premise that impact can and should be measured within an accounting framework with the aim of harnessing the economy to improve society and the planet.43 43 Harvard Business School | Impact-Weighted Accounts. - 25 -
We share the view that impact-adjusted measurements should be reported with reference to generally accepted accounting frameworks such as GAAP and IFRS in order to facilitate comparative analysis. To harness the power of capital markets to accelerate decarbonization, externalized climate impacts should be reflected in risk-adjusted (pro forma) financial accounts that can be easily contrasted with financial statements prepared under GAAP/IFRS. This will both facilitate comparative measurement and leverage existing accounting frameworks used in fundamental equity analysis. 2. Emissions pricing Pricing emissions is necessary to translate transition risk into firm-level financial impacts on revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and cashflows (as illustrated in Figure 8). Imputing a price on emissions transforms environmental metrics (e.g., absolute emissions, emissions per unit of production, or emissions per euro or dollar of revenue) into risk-adjusted financial accounts (e.g., carbon-adjusted expenses and net income) and ratios (e.g., carbon-adjusted earnings per share and profit margin) that are essential for comparative financial analysis. Pricing transition policy risk is tantamount to pricing carbon emissions (i.e., $/tCO e). There are 2 different approaches to pricing emissions based on different objectives, including price projections from climate-related regulation, estimates of the social cost of carbon, internal carbon prices set by companies, estimates of the price required to change business decisions and behavior, and estimates of the price needed to achieve specific climate warming scenarios by a specified future date.44 Factoring carbon prices into financial analysis is essential for purpose-oriented and purely financially-oriented investors to prepare for a world with more explicit carbon pricing, whatever form those prices take. Monetizing carbon emissions transforms environmental metrics into risk-adjusted financial accounts and ratios that can be integrated into fundamental equity analysis or used for comparative benchmarking. a) Carbon pricing Carbon pricing estimates the carbon price needed to achieve a specified climate transition scenario – i.e., the estimated price of carbon required to limit global warming to a specified temperature increase by a specified future date. Carbon pricing based on a specified climate transition scenario is different than scenario alignment. Scenario alignment references the alignment of financed emissions with one or more transition scenarios. Scenario alignment measures absolute emissions relative to a target but does not monetize them.45 44 How-To Guide to Corporate Internal Carbon Pricing: Four Dimensions to Best Practice Approaches. 45 See 2° Investing Initiative| Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA). - 26 -
Figure 12 provides a schematic illustration of how a specific temperature target is translated into a carbon price, given specific assumptions – e.g., shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) – and using a specific climate model – e.g., integrated assessment models (IAMs). Target: Assumptions: Models: Transition Carbon e.g. 1.5C e.g. SSPs e.g. IAMs scenarios price Figure 12 Schematic overview on the translation of climate targets into carbon prices The Stern–Stiglitz Report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices is an example of carbon pricing. The Commission concluded that the explicit carbon price level consistent with achieving the Paris temperature target (i.e., to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C) is at least $50–100/tCO e by 2030, provided a supportive policy 2 environment is in place.46 Carbon pricing is subject to high estimation uncertainty. CFA Institute advises investors to run scenario analysis to see how a carbon price of $50–$100/tCO e would affect the companies 2 they analyze or hold in their portfolios.47 BlackRock (Carbon Beta), MSCI (Carbon Delta), and S&P Trucost offer tools for scenario pricing. BlackRock’s Carbon Beta uses sensitivity analysis to address the high estimation uncertainty regarding the impact of potential future carbon pricing schemes on corporate valuations.48 b) Offset pricing A simpler alternative to carbon pricing is offset pricing. Offset pricing is based on the cost to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. With offset pricing, a company’s carbon emissions are priced at the cost to offset them with negative emissions of an equal amount. Offset pricing should in theory reflect the lowest cost anywhere in the world to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at scale. A 2019 study from the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that a direct removal cost of $100 or less per ton of CO is economically feasible. It found that several land-based negative emissions 2 technologies are ready for large-scale deployment at costs competitive with emissions mitigation strategies in this cost range. However, the scale needed to meet climate goals would 46 https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54ff9c5ce4b0a53decccfb4c/t/59b7f2409f8dce5316811916/1505227332748 /CarbonPricing_FullReport.pdf. 47 Report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices. 48 Carbon Beta - A Framework for Determining Carbon Price Impacts on Valuation. Key differences between Carbon Beta and CQ are the purpose of the analysis and how emissions are priced. Whereas Carbon Beta is a framework for assessing the sensitivity of company valuations to different carbon pricing scenarios, CQ assesses comparative asset impairment risk and climate resilience using a universal offset pricing scheme. - 27 -
require unprecedented changes in land use that could affect food availability and biodiversity. The study found that other negative emissions technologies, such as direct air capture, have high potential capacity but are currently limited by high cost ($600/tCO e).49 2 Offset pricing is more objective than carbon pricing. Carbon pricing relies on highly uncertain assumptions about future socioeconomic and technological developments. Offset pricing relies on less uncertain assumptions about projected costs for negative emissions. In the future, offset pricing will be based on quoted market prices. This does not preclude selection of a reasonable estimate today and adjusting it in the future to reflect market prices. Offset pricing is also more conservative than carbon pricing. It evaluates a firm’s financial condition based on the counterfactual assumption of carbon neutrality in today’s economy, not a future economy several decades from now. Offset pricing is consistent with climate science in that it internalizes 100% of the cost of carbon neutrality today. Leaving aside considerations of economic feasibility, the safest solution for the planet would have been to reach carbon neutrality decades ago rather than in 2050 or thereafter. The world is already paying a high price for past carbon emissions. Getting to net zero by 2050 will not reverse the damage that has already occurred or the additional damage that will occur during the transition. Ultimately, it may be necessary or desirable to remove all of the carbon that has accumulated in the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution. Asset owners, analysts, and portfolio managers may want to measure a company’s sensitivity to carbon prices using a tool like BlackRock’s Carbon Beta.50 However, sensitivity of companies to different carbon prices is less important than the differentiated impact of a uniform carbon price applied consistently across competing firms and investment portfolios. Comparative measurement of transition risk is more reliable than direct measurement, for reasons discussed in Section C above. A 100% emissions offset approach has the important benefit of benchmarking a firm’s past, current and future financial performance against a net zero objective. If net zero is the goal, investors should understand how companies would perform under the constraints of carbon neutrality today, rather than speculate about the nature and timing of future scientific pronouncements and policy responses. The same holds true for investment portfolios. Past carbon emissions can give rise to a contingent carbon liability. Imputing an emissions offset price for past emissions is analogous to the legal doctrine of disgorgement and thus a reasonable measure of transition risk arising from litigation. Disgorgement is an equitable remedy used to prevent unjust enrichment by requiring a defendant to give up any profits it made as a result of illegal or wrongful acts. Imputing a cost for negative emissions figuratively 49 See Businesses Aim to Pull Greenhouse Gases From the Air. Itʼs a Gamble, New York Times, Jan. 18, 2021, and National Academies of Sciences |Negative Emissions Technologies and Reliable Sequestration: A Research Agenda (2019). 50 BlackRock | Introducing Carbon Beta: What pricing carbon means for investors. - 28 -
disgorges profits made by avoiding the expense to fully offset the harm to society resulting from past emissions. Disgorgement is not merely a hypothetical legal risk. Rather it is a contingent liability.51 The State of Rhode Island recently sued 21 energy companies for climate change impacts that the state has experienced and will experience in the future. Rhode Island claimed that the defendants’ sale of fossil fuel products, along with simultaneous concealment of the known hazards of these products, and their championing of anti-science campaigns caused the state’s injuries. Among other damages, the lawsuit seeks to disgorge profits earned by the defendants from externalizing social and environmental costs. As an example of unjust enrichment from the externalized costs of past emissions going back decades, the complaint references internal Exxon reports from 1980 stating that ""technology exists to remove C0 from [fossil fuel power 2 plant] stack gases but removal of only 50% of the C0 would double the cost of power 2 generation.""52 c) Uniform pricing Both the timing and amount of future carbon prices are subject to significant uncertainty. High accuracy in the forecasting of future carbon prices cannot be expected. Nonetheless, the decision-utility of carbon pricing depends on comparative materiality not accuracy. The objective is to assess the differential impact on companies and portfolios over time. The assumed price does not matter, so long as it is scientifically and economically reasonable and consistently applied. To facilitate comparative measurement, emissions should be monetized in a manner that allows consistent and uniform peer-to-peer and year-over-year comparisons of companies and portfolios across all sectors and all regions. Regardless of how a carbon price is determined, when comparative measurement is the goal, it should be consistently and uniformly applied, regardless of source or timing. The application of non-uniform pricing, i.e., forecasts, may say more about the forecast than the latent risk embedded in a firm’s current business activities and practices. (1) Source of emissions To facilitate comparative measurement, emissions pricing should be applied uniformly to all emissions everywhere, regardless of source or location. Applying the same carbon price to all emissions everywhere allows comparability across assets, firms, sectors, portfolios, and regions. 51 Under GAAP, a contingency is defined as “an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Resolution of the uncertainty may confirm the acquisition of an asset or the reduction of a liability or the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability.” Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies. 52 State of Rhode Island v. Chevron. - 29 -
Idiosyncratic emissions pricing using scenario analysis is inherently subjective and ill-suited for comparative measurement. When assumptions used in scenario analysis are unique to the analyst the result is a “black box” analysis that precludes reliable comparative measurement. Individual financial institutions may appropriately use idiosyncratic scenario analysis and alignment tools for internal purposes, as recommended by CFA Institute and 2° Investing Initiative, to assess how transition risk could affect their portfolios. But accountability requires that financial markets as a whole must have universal objective benchmarks. Uniform carbon pricing is consistent with the scientific realities of global warming. Carbon emissions are fungible. The climate does not differentiate between emissions in the United States and emissions in China or between carbon removed from the atmosphere in Europe or Asia. Uniform carbon pricing is objective. A uniform carbon price eliminates the need to consider subjective firm-specific economics. If a firm’s mitigation costs for reducing or eliminating emissions is lower than the cost to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it should rationally choose to mitigate. Conversely, from a public policy perspective, if the cost to remove emissions is lower than a firm’s cost to mitigate, the firm should rationally opt for removal. A uniform carbon price treats all firms in all sectors in all regions the same, regardless of differences in mitigation costs or policy forecasts. This reflects the scientific reality that the climate does not differentiate the warming impact of carbon emissions based on their source or the cost of preventing them in the first place. (2) Timing of emissions Emissions pricing should be applied uniformly over time. To gauge a firm’s progress toward net zero over time, the imputed price of carbon should remain constant over the period of analysis. Otherwise, investors may mistake false indications of progress resulting solely from changes in carbon prices for real progress toward net zero. The time period of analysis may be both prospective and retrospective, encompassing the period beginning when reliable emissions data is first available through the applicable net zero target date. E. Assurance An effective accountability framework must assure that reported measurements are what they purport to be and are free of material error and fraud. This highest level of assurance allows users to confirm the validity of inputs and independently reproduce measurements. 1. Data inputs Assurance requires that data inputs are reliable and accessible. CQ analytics rely on three categories of data – (1) current and prior period financial accounts data; (2) current and prior period emissions data; and (3) portfolio data. The reliability and reproducibility of CQ outputs depends on the quality and source of these data. - 30 -
a) Financial data Self-reported audited financial data (e.g., assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, net income, cash flows) are widely available for public equities and bonds. Generally accepted accounting principles and audit standards, as well as legal penalties for accounting fraud, provide reasonable assurance of accuracy and comparability. Users will have public access to financial data inputs that are identical to those used to produce CQ analytics for public companies and portfolios. b) Emissions data Poor quality and limited availability of emissions data is currently a significant obstacle to the estimation of transition risk and low-carbon investment. Given the largely voluntary nature of GHG reporting – e.g., Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reporting – and lack of reporting standards, investors worry about the quality of reported data.53 According to the TCFD, the share of MSCI world index companies — collectively around 60% of world market capitalization — that disclose their emissions has stalled at around 50% in recent years.54 CDP currently provides estimated data for around a third of the Scope 1 emissions and slightly more than half of Scope 2 emissions from the over 5,000 companies it covers.55 Few companies report Scope 3 emissions,56 although they could account for more than 50% of the carbon footprint for companies in many industries.57 Emission scopes are defined in Section II.A.2 below. For these reasons, a transparent emission data strategy is an important feature of assurance. Considerations include data sources, whether data are third party verified (since emission data databases often use self-reported data, which is less reliable), and how to resolve data gaps. Looking forward, we expect that increasing levels of accountability will pressure more companies to self-report audited emissions data for all relevant scopes. Subject to global data gaps, users will have access to emissions data inputs that are identical to those used to produce CQ measurements. 53 Climate finance and disclosure for institutional investors: why transparency is not enough. 54 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Forward-Looking Financial Sector Metrics Consultation, October 2020. 55 CDP, CDP Full GHG Emissions Dataset 2019 Summary, 2019. 56 According to data available through the Bloomberg Professional Service, only 8% of the nearly 11,500 companies in the BESGPRO Index report Scope 3 GHG emissions. 57 Kepler Cheuvreux, Carbon Compass: Investor Guide to Carbon Footprinting, November 23, 2015, pp. 20–23. - 31 -
c) Portfolio data When assessing investment portfolios, portfolio constituent and weighting data are required in addition to financial and emissions data at the constituent company level. The source of portfolio data depends on whether the portfolio is public or private. Public portfolios include passive exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds (MFs). The U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates ETFs under Rule 6c-11 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act). Each business day, an ETF must disclose the ticker symbol of each portfolio holding, the quantity of each security held, and the percentage weight of the holding in the portfolio.58 The 1940 Act requires MFs to make similar disclosures.59 Private portfolios, including actively managed funds and private equity are available only if voluntarily disclosed. Users will have public access to portfolio data inputs that are identical to those used to produce CQ measurements for ETFs and MFs. 2. Reproducibility Reproducibility of outputs requires access to identical inputs, transparent methodologies, and elimination of entity-specific assumptions and judgments. a) Transparency As shown in Figure 3, asset owners (principals) rely on reporting from asset managers (agents) to understand how climate-related risks and opportunities are managed within each of their portfolios. Asset managers in turn rely on reporting from corporate managers to understand how climate-related risks and opportunities are managed within the individual firms in which they invest. Asset managers are accountable to asset owners just as corporate managers are accountable to shareholders. Transparency is a precondition for accountability. Transparency and accountability are also mutually reinforcing. Transparency strengthens accountability by facilitating monitoring. Accountability strengthens transparency by incentivizing agents to ensure that their actions are properly understood and rewarded.60 Transparency and confidentially often conflict. For example, commercial and nonprofit data providers may worry that release of proprietary methodologies used to produce climate scores will give competitors an unfair advantage. Too often the result is ratings produced with black box methodologies and subjective assumptions that impede user validation and comparability. 58 17 CFR § 270.6c-11 - Exchange-traded funds. 59 U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission | Laws and Rules. 60 European Research Studies, Volume XII, Issue (1) 2009, Transparency in Financial Statements. - 32 -
Imagine if financial analysts could not independently reproduce “proprietary” earnings per share figures? The U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) has encountered similar concerns with non- GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures refers to financial information that is calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Some of the most common non-GAAP measures include EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. In reaction to the significant increase in use of non-GAAP measures the SEC has adopted rules to ensure transparency. When a company publicly discloses a non-GAAP financial measure, SEC Regulation G requires it to provide a presentation of the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP and a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure presented and the most directly comparable financial measure or measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. 61 Assurance that measures of transition risk, especially those derived from financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP/IFRS, are not misleading, erroneous or fraudulent, requires that the data inputs and method of calculating outputs are fully transparent to users. For this reason, we are choosing to fully disclose the inputs, assumptions, and formulas used to produce CQ measurements. b) Objectivity All estimates – including forward-looking accounting data, emissions inventories, and measures of transition risk – are subject to estimation uncertainty. Even measures of uncertainty are themselves estimates that are subject to uncertainty. When producing estimates, assurance requires that subjective assumptions and methodologies used to resolve uncertainty be fully disclosed and avoided where reasonably possible. For purposes of assurance, observable data inputs and objective methodologies are always preferable to unobservable data inputs and subjective methodologies. Examples of uncertainties in the measurement of transition risk include: • Carbon budgets • Current and future emissions • Business-as-usual scenarios • Temperature warming scenarios • Transition scenarios • Policy responses 61 SEC Final Rule: Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. - 33 -
• Carbon prices • Market shifts • Technology developments • Legal developments • Remaining useful life of emission-producing assets • Demand elasticity and tax incidence Subjective assumptions and methodologies used to resolve these uncertainties may or may not improve accuracy, but they will always reduce objectivity. For this reason, CQ analytics do not consider, for example, the ability of suppliers to pass carbon costs through to consumers because doing so requires subjective judgment, which undermine comparability, assurance and simplicity. Users can apply their own assumptions about demand elasticity and tax incidence when interpreting CQ outputs in the context of entity-specific analysis if they believe the benefits warrant the effort. Similarly, probability distributions of possible timing and impact, generated by using transition scenarios, climate targets and assumptions, may provide useful information about the range of uncertainty, but they also impede reproducibility. By fully disclosing subjective assumptions and methodologies, and avoiding them entirely where possible, CQ analytics enable users to independently reproduce its outputs. Our view is that any resulting loss in accuracy is more than offset by improved comparability and assurance. F. Simplicity Methodologies should be as simple as possible. Complex transition risk models can introduce incidental costs in the form of reduced comparability and assurance that are not outweighed by increased accuracy and decision utility. Added complexity is likely to introduce more systematic errors. Model outputs, such as ”assuming A,B,C for the baseline business-as-usual scenario, and D,E,F for the transition scenario, while disregarding G,H,I, the mean climate-adjusted value at risk for company X is Y,” therefore may lead to a perception of false precision and overconfidence. If the objective of complex models is to improve accuracy by resolving and measuring deep uncertainties and non-linearities, two questions must be asked – (1) are the absolute measures produced by these models sufficiently trustworthy to inform financial decisions; and (2) do the outputs produced by these models provide better comparative measures than simpler models? If the answer to both questions is negative, complexity may be a fool’s errand. The CQ methodology is designed to be as simple as possible to enable decision-useful peer-to- peer and year-over year comparative measurements … and no simpler. - 34 -
IV. Comparison to other carbon metrics A. Purpose of carbon metrics A good metric changes the way actors behave in a desired way. It is the most important criterion for a metric.62 What will principals and agents do differently to improve performance against the metric? If balancing the intrinsic value and risk in the world’s existing stock of long- lived tangible assets is the central management challenge of net zero, an effective carbon metric should inform that balance. This requires measurement of stocks rather than, or in addition to, flows. 1. Stocks and flows Economics, business, accounting, and related fields often distinguish between stocks and flows. A stock is measured at one specific time, and represents a quantity existing at that point in time, which may have accumulated in the past. Flows increase or decrease the quantity of stocks and are measured over an interval of time. Financial accounts for property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation are examples of stocks. Annual revenue or production quantities are examples of flows. All figures on a balance sheet are stocks. All figures on an income statement are flows. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the remaining 1.5° C carbon budget, and unrealized emissions from long-lived tangible assets are stocks. Annual GHG emissions are flows. The most important stocks for transition risk are long-lived tangible assets and the unrealized emissions they will emit over their useful lives. Accountants define assets as “probable future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events.”63 Long-lived assets have value based on their probable future economic benefits. Long-lived assets bear transition risk because of their future capacity to harm the climate, measured as unrealized emissions. Focus on current period flows such as revenues and production activity rather than stocks can distract attention from the underlying cause-and-effect relationships that must be understood and addressed to achieve net zero. 2. Cause and effect Revenues do not produce carbon emissions. Production outputs do not produce carbon emissions. Real assets do. Decarbonization does not depend on levels of revenue or production per se and focusing on these variables may divert attention from the fundamental financial and management challenge: How to replace the world’s existing stock of emission-producing long-lived tangible 62 See Lean Analytics: Use Data to Build a Better Startup Faster. 63 Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6. - 35 -
assets with low carbon alternatives on an accelerated schedule while maintaining an acceptable level of profitability? Ratios that correlate emissions with revenues or production may drive undesirable changes in behavior that generate unsustainable or illusory reductions in climate impact. As a result, they may incentivize the wrong behavior or result in no change in behavior at all. Intensity ratios benefit from lower emissions but can send confusing or misleading signals as to how emissions should be reduced. Should emissions be reduced in absolute levels or merely diluted relative to revenues, production or investment? Should managers focus on reducing emissions or increasing revenues, production or investment? What are the fundamental solutions? Is it feasible to achieve carbon neutrality by increasing revenues, production or investment without prematurely retiring and replacing emission-producing real assets? 3. Resistance to gaming and manipulation By diverting attention from the core financial challenge of net zero, intensity metrics may lead firm managers and investors to pursue and be fooled by illusory gains. For example, measures of revenue intensity may inspire corporate managers to manipulate the timing of revenue recognition. Improper revenue recognition tops the list of accounting fraud cases prosecuted by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission.64 Revenues are also sensitive to exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations, hedging activities, and consumer-based carbon taxes. Production intensity ratios are less susceptible to manipulation and false signaling but suffer from another weakness that limits their behavioral impact. They lack a standardized unit of measurement, which prohibits their uniform application at the asset, company, and portfolio level. B. Intensity ratios Standardized units of measurement commonly used as indicators of transition risk today include the following ratios: • Financial intensity ratios (i.e., carbon dioxide equivalents per million euro or dollar of sales: tCO e/$M sales). When applied at the company level, this ratio is generally 2 known as “carbon intensity”.65 • Production intensity ratios (i.e., tCO e/m2 for real estate, tCO e/MWh for power 2 2 utilities, tCO e/ton of steel produced for steel companies). 2 64 CFO Dive, Improper revenue recognition tops SEC fraud cases. 65 Academic and commercial climate tools that use carbon intensity ratios as risk indicators, include 2 Degrees Investing Initiative (PACTA), MSCI (Climate VaR), Carbone4 (Carbon Impact Analytics), ISS (ESG), Cambridge Econometrics (E3ME-FTT-GENIE), Oliver Wyman (climate transition risk methodology), PwC/The CO-Firm (Climate Excellence), Right (X-Degree Compatibility Model), SBTI (Sectoral Decarbonization and SDA Transport Tool), S&P Global Market Intelligence (Climate Linked Credit Risk Tool), University of Augsburg (CARIMA), and Vivid Economics (Climate Risk Toolkit). - 36 -
A significant shortcoming of these intensity ratios is that they employ the wrong numerator – current period emissions. By accounting solely for current period emissions they omit consideration of the unrealized emissions baked into long-lived tangible assets. Measuring transition risk with intensity ratios that consider only current period emissions is akin to assessing the lifetime maintenance costs of a new car based on the assumption that it will last only one year. Revenue and production intensity ratios also employ the wrong denominator. They use flows when they should instead use stocks. C. Comparison of CQ analytics to intensity ratios CQ produces a wide range of risk-adjusted financial ratios that reflect internalized costs for past, current and future emissions. CQ ratios fall into two categories – (1) risk-adjusted versions of financial ratios; and (2) the Carbon Quotient ratio. Risk-adjusted versions of traditional financial ratios are derived from pro forma risk-adjusted financial accounts. For example, earnings per share can be calculated based either on GAAP/IFRS net income or on net income adjusted for imputed carbon expense. The Carbon Quotient ratio is an innovative financial metric that correlates the imputed cost of unrealized future emissions with the capitalized value of the assets that produce them. It is designed to drive the behavioral change specifically needed to reach net zero. The Carbon Quotient ratio has several advantages over revenue and production intensity ratios. For example, the Carbon Quotient ratio: • captures the impact of future emissions from existing assets • tracks changes in the underlying source of emissions • is less sensitive to exchange rate and revenue fluctuations • can be used where there is no separately accountable business unit (i.e., financed assets) • reflects asset efficiency (producing more revenues with fewer assets) in addition to revenue intensity • is less susceptible to short-term manipulation D. Portfolio emissions When applied at the portfolio level, carbon intensity (tCO e/$M sales) is called weighted- 2 average carbon intensity (WACI). A portfolio’s WACI is the weighted average of the carbon intensity of each constituent of the portfolio. WACI indicates a portfolio’s exposure to potential climate change-related risks relative to other portfolios or a reference standard. The formula for WACI is: 𝑛 𝐸𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑖 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝐼 = ∑ 𝑋 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 $𝑀 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖=0 - 37 -
(with i = borrower or investee) The TCFD’s final report included a qualified endorsement of WACI: The Task Force believes the weighted average carbon intensity metric, which measures exposure to carbon-intensive companies, … can be applied across asset classes, is fairly simple to calculate, and does not use investors’ proportional share of total equity and, therefore, is not sensitive to share price movements. The Task Force acknowledges the challenges and limitations of current carbon footprinting metrics, including that such metrics should not necessarily be interpreted as risk metrics. Nevertheless, the Task Force views the reporting of weighted average carbon intensity as a first step and expects disclosure of this information to prompt important advancements in the development of decision-useful, climate-related risk metrics.66 Whereas WACI is not a risk metric, the weighted-average Carbon Quotient (WACQ) ratio is a measure of an investment portfolio’s transition risk. The formula for WACQ is: 𝑛 𝑈𝑛𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝐶𝑎𝑟𝑏𝑜𝑛 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 𝑖 𝑊𝐴𝐶𝑄 = ∑ 𝑋 𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝑖 𝑖 𝑖=0 (with i = borrower or investee) Because they are agnostic to ownership share (unlike financed emissions), WACI and WACQ both facilitate comparative measurement with non-equity asset classes. At the portfolio level, WACQ has the same benefits compared to WACI that the Carbon Quotient ratio has to the carbon intensity ratio at the individual company level discussed above because with WACI: (1) the numerator (current period emissions) is not forward-looking; (2) the denominator is a flow (revenue) rather than a stock (assets); and (3) WACI reflects a portfolio’s exposure to carbon-intensive companies instead of its exposure to investment risk based on impairment or stranding of the underlying assets. E. Financed emissions Financed emissions are absolute emissions that banks and investors finance through their loans and investments.67 According to the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, emissions from loans and investments should be allocated to the 66 TCFD Final Report, Section E.5 at p. 37 (emphasis added). 67 PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry. - 38 -
reporting financial institutions based on the proportional share of lending or investment in the borrower or investee.68 The methodologies for calculating financed emissions in the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry apply the same general attribution principles across all asset classes: 1. Financed emissions are always calculated by multiplying an attribution factor (specific to that asset class) by the emissions of the borrower or investee. 2. The attribution factor is defined as the share of total annual emissions of the borrower or investee that is allocated to the loans or investments. 3. The attribution factor is calculated by determining the share of the outstanding amount of loans and investments of a financial institution over the total equity and debt of the company, project, etc. that the financial institution is invested in. The following formula calculates the financed emissions of investments in listed equities and corporate bonds and business loans and unlisted equity: 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑑 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = ∑𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑋 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑐 𝑐 𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑖 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦+𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡 𝑖 (with i = borrower or investee company) For investments in commercial real estate, mortgages, and motor vehicle loans, the denominator in the attribution factor is property value at origination. Otherwise, the formula is the same. Like WACI, financed emissions should not necessarily be interpreted as a risk metric. PCAF says measurement of financed emissions provides the starting point to assess and disclose climate- related risks in line with TCFD recommendations; set science-based targets using emission- based methods developed by organizations like the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi); and inform climate strategies and actions that direct capital to support the alignment of financial flows with the Paris Agreement’s goals.69 WACQ and PCAF have different but complimentary objectives and benefits. Whereas PCAF’s objective is to measure emissions financed through loans and investments, WACQ’s objective is 68 GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. 69 PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry. - 39 -
to measure carbon risk in a portfolio of assets. Where PCAF reflects a financial institution’s alignment with net zero, WACQ reflects the alignment of financed assets with net zero. The PCAF financed emissions metric differs from WACQ in several important ways: • It does not consider unrealized (future) emissions. • It does not measure transition risk in the underlying assets. • It does not inform pricing of transition risk and opportunity. • It does not incentivize emission reductions in the real economy. Loans and investments do not produce carbon emissions in the real economy. Because it focuses narrowly on absolute emissions, the financed emissions metric may divert attention from the more difficult task of differentially measuring and pricing transition risk and opportunity. This may lead financial institutions to simplistically red-line investments in carbon-intensive sectors and green-light investments in low carbon sectors. At best, overreliance on negative and positive screening as a substitute for fundamental analysis may result in the financing of uncompetitive companies. At worst, it could lead to substantial mispricing and financial instability, which would undermine the long-run ability of the financial system to efficiently allocate capital.70 Within every sector, there will be climate leaders who should get more capital and climate laggards who should get less. It’s the job of financial markets to differentiate between the two. Table 2 compares the CQ ratio to other carbon metrics.

scenario analysis, target setting, mitigation, and reporting. The unifying objective of these initiatives is to harness the power of financial institutions to accelerate decarbonization of the real economy. Measuring and reporting financed emissions is a central focus or supporting element of many of these initiatives.

Target The net zero GPS facilitates target setting and increases accountability for setting results.

VI. Use cases A. Macro prudential policy and regulation Central banks can use CQ analytics to guide and operationalize climate-related risk policies. There is a broad consensus among members of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) that, at the very least, central banks should carefully assess, and where appropriate adopt, additional risk management measures to protect their balance sheets against the financial risks brought about by climate change. However, there is yet no consensus among central banks as to the relevant measures for quantifying climate-related financial risk. The NGFS recognizes that carbon intensity and 2°C alignment metrics provide only a rough indicator of climate-related risks, without delivering a financial quantification of the risks incurred.71 B. Asset allocation Asset owners, active asset managers and corporate managers can use CQ analytics to align their financial investments and capital expenditures with net zero commitments while honoring their fiduciary duty to generate long term risk-adjusted returns. CQ analytics can also assist passive investors in benchmarking transition risk among competing passive investment options. C. Benchmarking CQ analytics provide a standardized unit of measurement that organizations can use to evaluate transition risk on an absolute or comparative basis. Firm managers can use CQ analytics to identify strengths and weaknesses relative to competitors. Asset owners and managers can use CQ analytics to differentiate leaders from laggards in the global race to net zero. D. Disclosure Self-reporting organizations can incorporate CQ analytics into their TCFD climate-related financial disclosures relating to metrics and targets to demonstrate how they are progressing toward net zero. Disclosure will be especially beneficial where the data inputs are non-public (e.g., unlisted companies and portfolios). Financial institutions can supplement financed emissions disclosures with CQ analytics to give a forward-looking measure of portfolio transition risk. E. Due diligence Financial and non-financial organizations can use CQ analytics to identify and assess potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on prospective mergers, acquisitions, and financings. 71 Network for Greening the Financial System Technical Document: Adapting central bank operations to a hotter world (March 2021) (see Section 6.2 Metrics). - 43 -
F. Engagement and voting Asset owners and managers can use CQ analytics to strengthen their engagement with companies in carbon-intensive sectors and to inform proxy voting.72 G. Index construction Asset managers can use CQ analytics to modify existing indices, make their own new indices, or request new indices from index providers. H. Governance Boards and senior management can use CQ analytics to inform its processes for strategic direction, risk oversight, financial reporting, stakeholder relations, and corporate citizenship. CQ analytics can also help self-reporting organizations prepare climate-related financial disclosures on governance, as recommended by the TCFD, including the board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities and management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. I. Risk management Organizations can use CQ analytics to identify, assess and manage the potential financial impacts of the transition to net zero, as illustrated in Figure 8. In particular, CQ analytics helps organizations assess and respond to the risk that long-lived tangible assets will become impaired or stranded. CQ analytics can also help self-reporting organizations prepare climate- related financial disclosures on risk management, as recommended by the TCFD, including how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks, and how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization’s overall risk management. J. Strategy Organizations can incorporate CQ analytics into their strategic analysis to develop a roadmap of where and how it will compete in a low carbon economy. CQ analytics can also help self- reporting organizations prepare climate-related financial disclosures on strategy, as recommended by the TCFD, including the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term, the impact of climate- related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning, and the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including net zero by 2050. 72 See e.g., BlackRock: Our 2021 Stewardship Expectations Global Principles and Market-level Voting Guidelines. - 44 -
VII. Conclusion – the CQ accountability report card The world is rapidly committing to net zero by mid-century. To reach this goal, there must be an effective accountability framework that spans the entire investment value chain. An effective net zero accountability framework requires measurements that are relevant and actionable, forward-looking, comparable, integrated with GAAP/IFRS, trustworthy, and simple. Table 4 grades Carbon Quotient analytics against these criteria. Criteria Carbon Quotient Analytics Relevant & CQ analytics provide a single measure of climate-related asset impairment actionable risk that is relevant and actionable for all actors across the investment value chain. Forward- CQ analytics accounts for unrealized emissions and provides a GPS for looking getting to net zero. Comparable CQ analytics avoids subjective and entity-specific assumptions that impede comparative measurement. Integrated CQ analytics integrate easily into GAAP/IFRS financial accounting. Trustworthy CQ outputs can be independently reproduced. Simple The CQ methodology eliminates unnecessary complexity. Table 4 CQ accountability report card We believe financial institutions and corporate managers can and will act on measurements with these qualities. And because the CQ ratio and WACQ provide a single measure of transition risk that is relevant and actionable for all actors across the investment value chain, we believe it can make an invaluable contribution to net zero accountability.

Appendix I. Definitions and formulas A. Terms Asset turnover is a widely used measure of financial efficiency, calculated as revenues divided by assets. Alternatively, when applied to physical assets, asset turnover can be measured as British Thermal Units (BTUs) produced or consumed divided by assets. Assets are tangible long-lived assets capitalized on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment, at cost, less accumulated DD&A expense. Asset life is a measure of the estimated remaining depreciable life of assets, calculated as property, plant and equipment, at cost, less accumulated DD&A expense divided by current period DD&A expense. See example for Exxon. When applied to unlisted assets, asset life may be estimated using relevant benchmarks, such as IRS Class Lives and Recovery Periods. Carbon contra asset is a risk-adjusted asset account with a credit balance (e.g., accumulated DD&A expense). It is described as ""contra"" because having a credit balance in an asset account is contrary to the normal or expected debit balance. The carbon contra asset is equal to unrealized carbon expense. Carbon expense is an imputed expense for the unpaid cost to offset a firm’s current period carbon emissions with negative emissions – i.e., the incremental cost to achieve carbon neutrality in the current period, calculated as realized emissions times carbon price less separately reported expenses for carbon taxes and cap-and-trade emissions credits. Carbon expense reduces pro forma net income and EBITDA. Carbon expense ratio is a ratio calculated as carbon expense divided by revenue. Alternatively, when applied to physical assets, the carbon expense ratio can be measured as carbon expense divided by BTUs produced or consumed. Carbon price is a constant value ($/tCO2e) reflecting the cost to remove carbon from the atmosphere at scale. Our analysis uses $100/tCO2e, which is a cost the U.S. National Academy of Scientists says is economically affordable (albeit not yet technically achievable). Carbon Quotient ratio is a normalized measure of carbon risk that represents the imputed cost of future carbon emissions associated with emission-producing assets relative to the capitalized value of those assets. CQ can be calculated as: (a) unrealized carbon expense divided by assets, or (b) carbon expense ratio times asset turnover times asset life. Carbon risk, also called transition risk, is a function of the imputed cost of carbon for realized emissions and unrealized emissions. Carbon risk is positively correlated with asset life and unrealized emissions. - 46 -
Contingent carbon liability is a risk-adjusted liability account for unpaid costs to offset a firm’s past carbon emissions with negative emissions, calculated as the sum of accumulated carbon expense for prior periods. DD&A expense arises from the gradual expensing of capitalized assets over time through depreciation, depletion and amortization in order to match costs to revenues. Realized emissions are a firm’s greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e) for the current period, including direct and indirect emissions, as appropriate, net of actual emissions offsets. Unrealized carbon expense is a risk-adjusted contra asset account representing the imputed cost of future emissions, calculated as carbon expense times asset life. Unrealized emissions are future greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e) that will result from the continued use of a firm’s assets over their remaining life, calculated as realized emissions times asset life. Weighted-average Carbon Quotient (WACQ) ratio is an asset weighted average Carbon Quotient ratio for an investment portfolio. It is a measure of carbon risk in a portfolio of loans and investments.

The Carbon Quotient ratio for an unlisted portfolio of assets is calculated as the sum of the Carbon Quotient ratios of each asset multiplied by the weight of the investment in each asset as a percentage of total assets under management (AUM). Measured in this way, the transition risk of an unlisted portfolio can be compared to the transition risk of a listed portfolio. - 48 -
II. Methodology Figure 15 shows CQ’s inputs and outputs. The process starts with collection of climate data inputs, including information on net zero targets and negative emissions technology, feasibility and costs. We use this information to set a carbon proxy price and to calibrate the net zero GPS (i.e., destination and deadline). Next, we collect financial account and emissions data. We then apply various formulas to this financial and emissions data to produce risk-adjusted financial accounts, the Carbon Quotient ratio, other risk-adjusted financial ratios, and a net zero GPS map tailored to specific assets, companies, and sectors.

A. Data collection CQ analytics use three types of data inputs: (1) current and prior period financial accounts data; (2) current and prior period emissions data; and (3) portfolio data. The reliability of CQ outputs depends on the quality of these inputs. 1. Financial accounts data Current and prior period verified financial accounts data is widely available from a variety of financial data providers, such as Bloomberg. 2. Emissions data Where available, CQ includes: • All Scope 1 and 2 emissions. • Scope 3 emissions for certain sectors where these emissions are highly material and available. • Verified emissions offsets (if reported separately from gross emissions). Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions occurring from sources (real assets) that are owned or controlled by the company. These include, for example, emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, and vehicles, and from chemical production in owned or controlled process equipment. Scope 2 accounts for indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity consumed by the company. Scope 2 emissions are a proxy for electric energy usage. Pass-through of carbon costs from electric utilities will result in higher electricity prices, which in turn will result in higher operating costs, lower margins, and lower return on assets for electricity users. Inefficient electricity-powered assets have higher scope 2 emissions and are at greater risk of becoming impaired or stranded relative to more energy efficient alternatives. Scope 3 covers all other indirect emissions. They are a consequence of the activities of the company but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the company. Some examples of scope 3 activities are extraction and production of purchased materials, transportation of purchased fuels, and use of sold products and services. CQ accounts for Scope 3 emissions when they result from the transportation or use of sold products – e.g., fossil fuels and vehicles.73 Table 5 lists the implementation schedule for inclusion of Scope 3 emissions under the PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry.74 73 See Race is on as carmakers shut, switch or sell combustion engine factories. 74 PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry. - 50 -

Data providers, which typically offer scope 1 and 2 emissions data, collect self-reported emissions data, reported either through a standardized framework such as CDP or in official financial filings and environmental reports. They often have their own methodologies to estimate emissions when data are not self-reported. b) Third-party verification Self-reported emissions data for public equities and bonds are less widely available than financial data. When emissions data is available, it may lack reasonable assurance of accuracy and comparability. Accounting standards for carbon emissions exist but they are not as generally accepted and broadly applied as financial accounting standards. Reported emissions are generally unaudited and not subject to legal penalties for fraud or error. c) Missing data strategy This topic will be addressed in a separate policy document. 3. Portfolio data Portfolio data – constituents and weightings – is collected from public sources for listed MFs and ETFs. B. Calculations Once the required data inputs are available, the next step in the process is to apply the formulas described above to produce company and portfolio risk-adjusted financial accounts and ratios. The only subjective variable in these calculations is the assumed carbon price. We propose to use a carbon price of $100/tCO e (undiscounted and uninflated). Users may wish to perform 2 sensitivity analysis with different carbon prices for internal purposes. - 51 -
C. Net zero GPS Once the Carbon Quotient calculations are complete, the results are plotted on a timeline starting at a selected point in the past (e.g., 2010) and extending through a target date for reaching net zero. See discussion in III.B.3. - 52 -","The comment introduces Carbon Quotient (CQ) analytics, an open-source tool designed to measure, manage, and report climate-related financial risk. It likens the journey to net zero by 2050 to a challenging endurance race, emphasizing the need for a 'GPS' to guide decision-making and ensure accountability across the investment value chain. CQ analytics aim to provide this guidance by applying accounting principles to track progress towards net zero, holding corporations and financial institutions accountable for their climate impact. The tool set includes the Carbon Quotient ratio, risk-adjusted financial accounts, and a net zero GPS, which together help assess transition risks and opportunities. The comment highlights the importance of measuring unrealized emissions from long-lived assets and integrating these metrics into financial decision-making to drive meaningful climate action. It also discusses the limitations of current climate risk tools and the need for a systematic approach to climate risk metrics."

Every day that we accept the business model of these companies as normal or acceptable is a further increment of heating to the Earth, inflicted upon our children without their consent. 
If this government does not wish to preside over the forfeiture of our last chance to stabilize our climate, we need the Federal Reserve to direct all major financial institutions under federal regulation to terminate all credit, insurance, and banking relationships with fossil fuel companies.

When analyzing the cost to benefit ratio of proposed regulations, include the Social Cost of Carbon. Use the price calculated by the Interagency Working Group, which is being update in January 2022. However, recalculate the price at a discount rate of zero. (The IWG looked at discount rates between 2.5 and 5.0 percent in 2021. This underestimates the intergenerational cost of carbon.)

I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.+
Failure on the part of banks to act now will prove far more costly in the future — if indeed we have a future, given the exponential increase in damaging evidence of climate change, climate shock, global warming caused by continuing to rely on fossil fuels. I have divested myself from holdings having anything to do with fossil fuels, really a necessity for individuals as well as over-large banks out for immediate profit to the detriment of our country's citizens and the wider world.","The comment addresses Comptroller Hsu, expressing concern over banks' investments in fossil fuels despite their public commitments to combat climate change.

Banks are in the unique position of financing clean energy projects and reducing their investments in fossil fuel projects. In view of the unprecedented fires, floods and storms that have recently destroyed businesses and residences in the United States, it is urgent that banks update their assessments of the dangers to their investments. When subways are flooded in New York City, it presages the near term threat to highly valued property and business in that city. This is one example but the fires in the west have destroyed wineries and factories. Banks need to address the current threat which is profound.","The comment addresses the issue of climate change and banks' role in financing fossil fuels, despite public claims of addressing climate change.

Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, as stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The commenter, a senior citizen, expresses concern over banks' investments in fossil fuels despite their public commitments to addressing climate change.

kyn-soiq-qte4,"Developing Climate Risk Assessment Regulations or Climate Risk Regulatory Guidance is a daunting task for many reasons. To begin with, Climate Risk needs to be clearly defined. Many articles and studies on Climate Risk focus on the future and speculate on widely differing scenarios about how Climate Change will affect Climate Risk. In my opinion, commingling Climate Risk with Climate Change is a mistake at this time. The extent and effects of Climate Change remain the subject of a continuing debate about both the degree of climate change, the rate of climate change, and the effects of Climate Change.
When developing possible guidance and potential regulations pertaining to Climate Risk why not start with a “first generation” basic Climate Risk model and then build upon that model with time and experience?
What do I mean by a basic Climate Risk model? What I suggest is that the first generation of Climate Risk Assessments should be based on Climate Risk as it exists today without the controversy surrounding Climate Change speculation. 
This approach has many advantages. First, as with any new regulation, the first generation of Climate Risk Assessment Models will be controversial. Adopting a Climate Risk Model that is based on current-day conditions reduces the speculation and controversy involved when incorporating Climate Change considerations.
Second, there already exists data that measure climate exposure for many natural hazards, including flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, drought, severe cold, and more than a dozen other climate-related phenomena that are currently a real and immediate threat to banks and the communities they serve.
Third, by focusing on imminent climate-related threats, climate risk assessments are not only likely to be more accurate but are more likely to attract more support because it’s easier to perceive and appreciate a threat that currently exists and could happen any day, rather than a threat that may be decades away.
How quickly could such a Climate Risk Assessment Model be developed? The answer is such a model already is available. Using data generated by at least 8 federal agencies GeoDataVision has adapted that data for banking purposes so that risk ratings in that data can be assigned to any bank asset, facility, loan or collateral location, etc. If anyone from the OCC is interested in reviewing the maps and risk ratings within the model, I would be pleased to provide a demonstration. We have written an article for publication regarding the model and are awaiting the approval process. As soon as that article is published (expected the first week of February) we will provide a copy to the OCC. Len Suzio","The comment addresses the challenges of developing Climate Risk Assessment Regulations, emphasizing the need to clearly define Climate Risk separately from Climate Change. The author argues against conflating Climate Risk with Climate Change due to ongoing debates about the latter's extent and effects. They propose starting with a ""first generation"" Climate Risk model based on current conditions, which would reduce speculation and controversy. This model would utilize existing data on natural hazards like flooding and hurricanes, making assessments more accurate and garnering more support by focusing on immediate threats. The author claims such a model already exists, adapted by GeoDataVision using federal data for banking purposes, and offers to demonstrate it to the OCC. An article on the model is pending publication."

kyz-bd7z-czqo,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks.  It's far past time to do the right thing.
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.

kz3-699k-24f9,"Coming Soon: Climate Risk Assessments for Banks – Are You Ready? By: Len Suzio, President, GeoDataVision LLC & Dean Stockford, President, M&M Consulting Climate Risk Assessments for banking purposes are in the early stages of development. No laws or regulations have been issued regarding the topic. Nonetheless, it is obvious that lawmakers and regulators are keenly intent on developing laws and regulations to require banks to develop climate‐related risk assessments. The Chairperson of the Federal Reserve and various Federal Reserve governors along with the Acting Comptroller of the Currency have publicly announced their intention to develop regulations and models to measure and evaluate Climate‐related risk exposures for banks. On November 8, 2021, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Michael Hsu, in a speech entitled, “Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask”, identified the following five questions:  “What is our overall exposure to climate change?”  “Which counterparties, sectors, or locales warrant our heightened attention and focus?”  “How exposed are we to a carbon tax?”  “How vulnerable are our data centers and other critical services to extreme weather?”  “What can we do to position ourselves to seize opportunities from climate change?” The signs are there, but no laws and no regulations have been published yet. It’s clear that regulators expect banks to already be engaged in monitoring and assessing climate risk for their institutions. But with no laws and no regulations what’s a banker to do? To begin with, while regulators have not yet issued specific quantifiable definitions of “climate risk”, it’s obvious that any Climate Risk definition would contain several important components: (1) climate hazards that are currently an immediate potential threat, (2) climate hazards that are not immediate but may become threats in the near future, and (3) climate‐implicated threats related to specific industries, particularly the energy and agricultural sectors. Moreover, the threats may present themselves in terms of implications for bank facilities, credit‐related risks (real estate secured loans for example), and climate effects on the communities served by a bank. Finally, climate risk may be in the form of ex ante and post ante analysis. What may surprise some people is there currently are climate risk databases that are adaptable for banking purposes, particularly for imminent climate hazard threats. Various federal agencies, including FEMA, NOAA, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the USGS, the USDA, etc., have collected climate and natural hazards risk data that can be the foundation for intelligent and quantifiable climate risk assessments for banks. With this data, maps and spreadsheets can be created that identify and display the distribution of climate‐related risk as it exists today across geographic areas that can be correlated with bank markets and generate quantifiable measurements correlated with the level of risk.
This kind of analysis isn’t just for the large banks. Regulators will expect smaller institutions to monitor their risk as well. Today, the cost of data and mapping services are affordable for even community banks who can also seize the initiative and establish themselves as leaders. You don’t have to wait for the “big guys” to lead the way! Below are 2 tables of the climate risk exposure position of a bank that captures multiple types of climate‐related risks matched against a loan portfolio.

Even more exciting is this data can be imported into maps making possible the visualization of your climate risk as it is spread across the communities your bank serves. GIS technology is particularly effective for climate risk analysis because it allows the viewer to see climate risk across geographies and communities. Including maps in a climate risk assessment program can really be eye‐opening Figure 1: Riverside CA Wildfire Risk ksiR ta oiloftroP egagtroM fo % Portfolio Exposure: Hurricane, Flooding, Lightning Risk Very High Relatively High Relatively Moderate
The map above depicts the risk from wildfires in the Riverside County, CA. What may surprise bankers and regulators alike is that climate risk exposure for many different types of natural climate risk hazards can be very granular right down to the lowest geographic level applied to other regulatory risks, such as Fair Lending and CRA performance, making detailed analysis on a never before possible basis. The map below depicts wildfire risk in Sun City CA and its neighborhoods. Figure 2: The combination of available climate data and GIS technology makes possible in‐depth qualitative and quantitative climate‐risk analysis today. There really is no need to wait for bank regulators to precisely define climate risk assessment. In fact, the situation today presents bankers with a rare opportunity to lead the regulators on an important topic and thereby increase the likelihood that the regulations that will ultimately be adopted will be realistic and compatible with processes already established within the industry. If you want to impress your regulator, show them the way with your own climate‐risk assessment!","The comment discusses the emerging need for climate risk assessments in the banking sector, despite the absence of formal laws or regulations. It highlights the intent of regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, to develop regulations for banks to evaluate climate-related risks. Key questions for banks include assessing exposure to climate change, carbon tax, and extreme weather impacts. The comment suggests that banks should proactively engage in climate risk assessments using existing data from federal agencies like FEMA and NOAA. It emphasizes that both large and small banks can utilize affordable data and mapping services to assess risks and potentially lead in this area. The use of GIS technology is recommended for visualizing climate risks across geographies. The comment argues that banks have an opportunity to influence future regulations by demonstrating leadership in climate risk assessment."

Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment expresses agreement with Comptroller Hsu's initiative to address climate change in the banking sector. It criticizes banks for publicly claiming to address climate change while continuing to invest heavily in fossil fuels, which exacerbates climate change and endangers the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. The commenter urges regulators to prevent banks from making short-term decisions that threaten the economy and communities. They support the proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management at all business levels, plan for long-term climate impacts, define climate risk exposures, and align internal strategies with public climate commitments. The commenter emphasizes the importance of banks' actions matching their net-zero carbon commitments and suggests that climate risk management should influence supervisory ratings. They call on the OCC to issue strong guidance to banks, protect against unsafe practices, and enforce remedies where necessary, highlighting the mutual benefits for the public and banks in minimizing climate risk."

Like many private entities, banks often lie to the public. They claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, all the while investing billions in the fossil fuel industry.

I believe in a strong federal government, because I've seen that, without regulation, corporations do what they please with little regard for the common good, whether that be affordable healthcare; clean land, water, and air; or the heath and well-being of wild animals or even their own customers.

We need to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.

As a member of Gen Z, climate change and its consequences have long been apparent to me. One of my first memories is footage from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina - I had a hard time understanding that no, this isn't from a movie, this is real life. As a Californian, I've lived in a drought for my entire life, and the Woolsey Fire would've burned my house down had the winds not diverted its wrath southward. I know that the climate crisis will get worse before it can get better, but we have to get our act together before things get even more out of hand than they already are. I ask again: please hold banks accountable when it comes to their climate pledges!

kzd-6cz9-94vu,"Comptroller Hsu,  I appreciate your effort but don't envy you in the complications of the task you are facing. Clearly, climate change will effect many aspects of our lives going into the future. Converting from hydrocarbons to green energy sources is paramount. We use petrochemicals in many ways (including lubricants, plastics, rubber, and even cosmetics); but we don't want to continue burning it up into the atmosphere. With the news of a large Antarctic ice shelf calving and melting such that the ocean level is projected to rise 1 to 3 feet. The ice sheets that the ice shelf was holding back is projected to add another 3 to 6 feet in sea level rise. Clearly many cities and towns along the coastline are poised to become the Venice of the US. One should think that financing projects that are untenable to maintain is a risk not worth taking. But what happens when the risk area is an entire city (like Miami)? We don't want the Federal government to be the backstop for bad financial decisions (as in the 2008 fiasco). My suggestion is that a table utilizing land elevations versus projected sea rise be used to limit the terms of any financial loan being proposed and granted in low lying areas. If we project sea levels to rise 1 to 3 feet in the next 10 years and the project is on coastal land 1.5 feet above current sea level, then no loan with a term longer than 10 years should ever be allowed. Going forward the term of any new loan should decrease based on the current sea level rise. A set table (or equation) for all to follow will provide clarity to the risk management sought. FEMA is the vehicle that will tap into scarce public funds due to bad financial decisions as each of the accelerating instances caused by climate change occur. It seems wise to also put term limits on loans for petrochemical projects as we try to ween our energy economy off of fossil fuels for the next critical decades. Coming up with some standard of term limiting loans would be the simplest and cleanest way to address the risk problem we all face. Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks’ continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: 1. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; 3. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 4. And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment emphasizes the need for regulatory support to aid grassroots organizers in influencing banks and asset managers to shift investments away from fossil fuels. The commenter thanks Comptroller Hsu for addressing climate change in banking, highlighting the contradiction between banks' public commitments to climate action and their continued investments in fossil fuels. This investment is seen as exacerbating climate change, which threatens the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. The commenter supports proposed guidance urging banks to integrate climate risk management, plan for long-term climate impacts, define risk exposures, and align internal strategies with public climate commitments. They advocate for banks' climate risk management to influence supervisory ratings and call for the OCC to enforce strong guidance to ensure banks' actions align with their zero carbon emissions commitments, protecting against unsafe practices and requiring remedies where necessary."
kze-n9x2-kdll,"4 February 2022 To: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks The United Nations Environment Programme - Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) is a strategic public- private partnership between the UN and over 400 global financial institutions. It has established some of the most important sustainability-oriented frameworks within the finance industry, including the Principles for Responsible Investment, the Principles for Sustainable Insurance and the Principles for Responsible Banking. It also convenes leading net zero alliances of banks, insurers and asset owners which form part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net-Zero. Since the issuance of the initial TCFD disclosure guidance, UNEP FI has led pilot programmes for over 100 banks, insurers and institutional investors on climate risk and TCFD disclosures. These programs have convened financial institutions, supervisors, and climate experts with a view to improving climate disclosure and climate risk management across the financial sector. Overview UNEP FI welcomes the publication of the OCC’s Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. This document provides actionable guidance to both financial institutions and financial supervisors. Within this document, we particularly welcome the following: • Continued acknowledgement that climate risks are financial risks and that additional guidance is required within the financial sector for their management • Recognition that climate change poses capital, liquidity, credit, legal/compliance, operational, and other risks • Principles for firms to evaluate their climate risks • A set of operational areas to consider in managing climate risks: governance, policies, procedures, and limits, strategic planning, risk management, data, risk management, and reporting, and scenario analysis • Guidance to consider multiple time horizons and different scenarios in assessing the preparedness of an institution to face climate-related financial risks • Specific guidance on approaches for the monitoring and reporting of climate-related financial risks by financial institutions We have a few reflections and recommendations on the principles that we believe would be helpful to share. In this response, we have addressed the associated consultation questions accompanying this evaluation process.
Questions Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? UNEP FI believes the principles articulated by the OCC are widely applicable to banks of all sizes. At present, they only apply to banks with over 100 billion dollars in total assets. While regulatory reporting or assessment requirements may vary by size and systemic importance of the institution, climate risks do not discriminate. Smaller banks are not immune to climate risks and may even be more susceptible if they are particularly concentrated in vulnerable sectors or geographies. Other supervisors such as the PRA in the UK have espoused similar principles but have not limited their scope by bank size. They instead require that regulated firms adopt a proportionate approach to managing those climate risks to which they are exposed, whilst also providing guidance as to what this might look like in practice. Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? Though UNEP FI’s work across multiple geographies, a constant request from financial institutions is to see examples of good practices in the diverse areas of climate risk management. Case studies on good practice can be a particularly useful resource for institutions as evidenced by the CDSB’s TCFD Good Practice Handbook and the IIF and UNEP FI’s TCFD Report Playbook. In the future, supervisors can also provide more detailed and actionable guidance through reports on the application of their principles. Firms in the Eurozone and UK have, in particular, found the supervisory review reports of the ECB and PRA useful in implementing their climate risk expectations. The work the NGFS has developed in conjunction with its members has also proved useful. When considering examples for inclusion, it is valuable to offer a diversity of examples that are applicable to banks of different sizes, geographies, risk profiles, and complexity. Guidance from regulator-sponsored industry forums has additionally provided useful risk management insights to different firm-types. In the UK for example, the PRA and the FCA co-chair the Climate Financial Risk Forum (‘CFRF’) whose members are drawn from industry. The CFRF has been successful in developing a significant body of practical industry guidance with regards to climate risk management covering diverse topics such as risk appetite statements, data, tools and scenario analysis. UNEP FI’s banking members have found that outreach by regulators has been an effective way for firms to better understand regulatory expectations and regulators to better appreciate current industry practices and challenges. General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? The challenges faced by firms many vary based on the nature of their exposures and the level of maturity in their climate risk program, but some common challenges can be identified. These include: 2
• Quantification of climate risks in both risk management and reporting. This challenge relates to a need to develop suitable models for the quantification, a need for stakeholders to understand and trust the outputs, and a need to assimilate those outputs into existing decision-making processes. • Data limitations. This challenge pertains both to the availability of credible emissions data (especially for small and medium enterprise clients) for transition risk assessments as well as granular data on physical risks for different geographies. The identification of client legal risks is another area where data may be a limiting factor. • Updating existing business practices. This challenge concerns the fact that even when analysis is conducted for TCFD reporting or to meet regulatory requirements, there is no guarantee that it is used to shape future strategy or decision-making. Processes and procedures around underwriting and origination as well as risk limits and thresholds all need to be updated to consider climate risks. As noted in the prior response, the OCC can help firms overcome these challenges through reports that offer example-based guidance on good practices and engagement with industry initiatives dedicated to tackling these challenges. UNEP FI believes that increased regulatory demands for climate disclosure have enhanced the quality of climate-related financial disclosures overall and scenario analysis in particular. Thoughtful regulatory assessments with compliance consequences and capital adequacy assessments can further advance the integration of climate risk management into firms’ existing operations. Current Risk Management Practices UNEP FI believes that these questions can be best answered directly by banks responding to this consultation. However, there are a few points that may be useful to briefly mention along with some resources that explore these topics in greater detail. 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? In 2021, UNEP FI released a report on the landscape of climate risk tools that provides an overview on the features of more than 3 dozen physical and transition risk tools. In March of 2022, a supplement to this report will be released with over a dozen case studies from institutions that have piloted some of the latest commercially available tools. 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? Materiality has been a challenging term to define, but it is worth considering the TCFD secretariat’s perspective: “companies should determine materiality for climate-related issues consistent with how they determine the materiality of other information included in their financial filings.” Complicating this approach may be the long-term and non-traditional nature of climate risks. In addition, considerations of “double materiality” are increasingly important, assessing not only climate risks faced by the firm, but risks that the firm’s activities pose to the climate. UNEP FI believes that heatmapping can be an important tool for initial assessment of the materiality of climate risks. In Beyond the Horizon, UNEP FI and its members developed a transition risk heatmap for a number of sectors and did likewise for physical risks in Charting a New Climate. 3
6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? UNEP FI considers risk assessment over a variety of different time horizons critical to evaluating a firm’s climate risks. While most strategic planning within financial institutions takes place within a 3-5 year time horizon, climate risk demands a wider range of assessment windows. Other organizations and initiatives, such as the investor-led Climate Action 100+, have defined specific horizons for short-term, medium-term, and long-term in ways that might be helpful for the OCC to consider. An example of similar action by a regulator comes from the European Banking Authority, which suggested that firms extend their strategic planning to at least 10 years. 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? Institutions have pursued diverse strategies to mitigate their climate risks including and in addition to the ones mentioned in the question. Some firms have developed exclusion lists or updated underwriting criteria to reduce potential climate risks. Others have set limits and targets on certain sectors or geographies. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers?4 What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? The ESG investing space has grown massively in the last few years. Similarly, demand for green projects has also grown and many firms are experimenting with new green products. The Climate Bonds Initiative has been a thought leader on the origination and development of these new products. Some institutions have gotten actively involved in carbon credit markets as well. With the rise in enthusiasm for ESG finance, scrutiny must be applied by supervisors to ensure claims of environmental impact are not just greenwash and to monitor the potential creation of a green asset bubble. 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? One of the many injustices of climate change is its disproportionate impact on the least fortunate. This holds true on a national as well as global level when considering the negative health effects of fossil fuel combustion or the consequences of worsening extreme events. Climate finance must be careful not to exacerbate the plight of society’s most vulnerable members in an effort to manage risk. Risk management should consider the needs of adaptation finance and community investment. This complex issue will likely require government or international intervention to prevent disinvestment under the guise of risk mitigation. At present, some banks are considering the climate impacts on local communities and supporting investment in climate-resilient infrastructure. Banks have also provided adaptation finance to municipalities and other local governments. 4
Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? As mentioned previously, UNEP FI’s 2021 Landscape Report provides details on climate risk tools. It also covers a variety of data providers. In terms of specific data and metrics, UNEP FI’s recent paper: A Good Practice Guide to Stress Testing contains a data section that elaborates the data requirements for physical and transition risk assessments. From a regulatory perspective, in 2021 the NGFS released a report on bridging data gaps, which highlights progress and remaining challenges in obtaining the necessary data for climate risk assessments. These publications contain common themes regarding banks’ climate data needs. Banks will need to work with clients, public data sources, and potentially commercial data providers to obtain the required data. Key considerations for climate data include: • Transition risk o Asset-level emissions data o Client transition plans o Granular transition pathways with relevant macroeconomic factors (e.g. energy demand, carbon price) o Legal proceedings against clients • Physical risk o Multi-hazard risk forecasts for specific areas o Geolocation of assets o Resiliency plans for assets 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? COP 26 saw the announcement of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which aims to consolidate the work of a number of sustainability initiatives into a coherent standard. In late 2021, the TCFD secretariat released consultations on transition plans, disclosure metrics, and portfolio alignment methodologies. Alignment around both disclosure standards and on good practices for climate risk management is important for financial sector actors. Supervisors can continue to augment their reporting requirements by considering how their requirements align with and build on the work of the ISSB and TCFD. A helpful example of regulatory standards that build on the common TCFD framework comes from the EBA’s Final draft implementing technical standards on prudential disclosures on ESG risks. Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? Banks are increasingly conducting climate scenario analysis for a variety of purposes. Use cases include regulatory assessments: mandated climate disclosures (and TCFD reporting) and climate stress tests, 5
development of a climate strategy, opportunity identification, client engagement, net-zero alignment and more traditional risk management: including updating underwriting criteria and setting climate-informed limits and targets. In conjunction with the Center for International Climate Research (CICERO), UNEP FI has published a guide on the use of integrated assessment models (IAMs) for financial practitioners entitled Pathways to Paris. With Oliver Wyman, UNEP FI also built a transition risk assessment tool that incorporates a variety of NGFS scenarios and their relative impacts on different sectors and geographies. UNEP FI will also be publishing two papers on scenario analysis in Q2 2022 for financial practitioners. The NGFS has developed a dedicated resource for those looking to use both their physical and transition risk scenarios that has proven useful to many institutions. Other commercial and non-commercial organizations are also working on similar scenario databases and tools. Common challenges that banks face when conducting climate scenario analysis include: • Lacking institutional knowledge about important climate scenario assumptions and how to interpret and apply results • Translating climate-related factors into financial risk drivers • Producing analysis that is relevant on the timeframes typically used to set bank strategy • Having adequate coverage of certain sectors and regions (non-energy sectors and non-OECD regions tend to have less data) 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? As 1.5˚ C has become a global climate goal, it would be helpful to make an explicit recommendation that scenario analysis include scenarios aligned to this temperature outcome. As previously stated, risk assessment over a variety of different time horizons is necessary in evaluating a firm’s climate risks. Climate scenario analysis should use scenarios and generate outputs with relevance over multiple time horizons. Other considerations include: • Scenarios considering the combined impacts of both physical and transition risks • Scenarios with varying degrees of economic severity • Transition scenarios with abrupt policy shifts, economic disruptions, and price volatility • Physical scenarios with impacts on supply chains, and the incorporation of tail risks and tipping points Should the OCC have any questions about this response, UNEP FI would be delighted to discuss our perspectives further or answer any related comments or questions. Sincerely, Eric Usher Head, UNEP-FI 6","The United Nations Environment Programme - Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) supports the OCC's Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, emphasizing the need for guidance on managing climate risks, which are financial risks. UNEP FI suggests that these principles should apply to banks of all sizes, not just those with over $100 billion in assets, as climate risks affect all institutions. They recommend providing examples of good practices and detailed guidance to help banks develop climate risk management practices. Challenges include quantifying climate risks, data limitations, and updating business practices. UNEP FI highlights the importance of regulatory engagement and reports to overcome these challenges. They also discuss the need for diverse strategies to mitigate climate risks, the importance of considering impacts on disadvantaged communities, and the necessity of robust data and reporting standards. Scenario analysis is crucial, and UNEP FI suggests including scenarios aligned with the 1.5°C global climate goal. They offer to discuss their perspectives further with the OCC."

This issue is personal to me, as climate change has already affected my family and my community. Members of my family live along the Mississippi River, where repeated ""100 year"" floods have directly affected them and their livelihoods. My elderly aunt and uncle live in Quincy, CA and were evacuated for weeks last year due to wildfires; two friends of mine lost everything in the Paradise fire; I have numerous additional friends and work colleagues who lost their homes to wildfires in other locations in California and Colorado over the past four years. A year and a half ago, the entire sky above my home was the color of blood in the middle of the day, and we spent weeks inside because the air was toxic from ash and smoke. Perhaps most importantly, I have a son who will be younger than I am today in 2050 -- a time horizon that is unfortunately much longer than that on which any of the banks you regulate operates.

kzf-mh9t-yp8i,"Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, DC 20219 RE: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu, Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the O ce of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. Evergreen Action is a national non-profit leading the fight to put bold climate action at the top of America's agenda, implement an all-out mobilization to defeat climate change and create millions of jobs in a clean energy economy. Evergreen Action commends the OCC for issuing draft principles on how large banks should incorporate climate-related threats into their operations. Climate-related risks, including various physical and transition risks, pose a grave threat to the safety and soundness of individual banks and the financial system. These draft principles are a historic step in the right direction to protect working families from the threat of a climate-fueled financial crash – and as such, we strongly encourage the OCC to implement this strong guidance. Evergreen Action is particularly supportive of the following recommendations in the draft guidance: 1. Banks should incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business, including policies, planning procedures, and limits; 2. Banks must plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as risks evolve and additional data becomes available; 3. It is crucial that banks ensure their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments. As well as expressing our broad support for the OCC’s draft principles, Evergreen Action would like to o er the following feedback. (Kindly note that we were also pleased to sign a letter, submitted by our colleagues at Public Citizen, that further expands upon these remarks.) Aligning Internal Strategies & Public Climate-Related Commitments: We commend the OCC’s draft guidance that recommends that any “public statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent with their internal
strategies and risk appetite statements” (p.3). This draft guidance appropriately holds banks accountable for their climate commitments and cracks down on greenwashing. This guidance is particularly relevant when discussing the recent commitments of large banks to create and execute net-zero transition plans. Last year, nine US banks, including Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase, made net-zero emissions commitments as members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). Yet many of these banks are also the biggest bankers of the 100 top fossil fuel expansion companies over the last half decade, and many continue to finance new greenhouse-gas related activities – actions that fly in the face of goals to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Now, the OCC should amend its draft guidance to say that banks committing to net-zero by 2050 transition plans should develop and implement credible internal strategies. These strategies must align with the demands of climate science, meet the imperatives of safety and soundness, and have measurable short and medium-term milestones, like a 50% reduction in financed emissions by 2030. As pointed out in the Public Citizen letter co-signed by Evergreen Action, measurable milestones are not only necessary for accountability, but also help avoid a “fire sale from banks trying to meet their commitments at the last minute” – in turn, a matter of safety and soundness. Fair access to financial services: The OCC’s draft guidance applies to large banks with $100B or more in consolidated assets. Yet, as pointed out in a letter drafted by Public Citizen and co-signed by Evergreen Action, more than 80% of banks supervised by the OCC are community banks that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Community banks typically serve certain areas and cannot easily shift locations without impacting local communities. At minimum, the OCC should acknowledge risks to community banks and highlight that the best risk-management measure for community banks is to reduce climate impacts through slashing emissions. You may find further recommendations related to aligning public climate commitments and internal strategies, o sets, and fair access to financial services in the Public Citizen group letter, which we have co-signed. Thank you for your consideration and work on this e ort. Sincerely, Evergreen Action PO Box 21961, Seattle WA 98111","Evergreen Action, a national non-profit focused on climate action, commends the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for its draft principles on climate-related financial risk management for large banks.

kzf-z6lg-i1hd,"February 9, 2022 Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, DC 20219 Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu, We are writing in response to your request for feedback on your draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Docket ID OCC-2021-0023). As a national consumer advocacy organization, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG) is concerned about the impacts of climate change on the consumer. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s most recent report in August 2021 warned about the planet’s course toward global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C and the resulting extreme weather patterns, unless there are deep cuts to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Avoiding these threats will require financial institutions and regulators taking them seriously. We, therefore, commend the OCC for its framework to address climate change risks, including measuring and monitoring risks, collecting data, and considering disparate impacts. Please find our rundown of climate change threats posed to consumers and solutions for mitigating those risks that we would like to see implemented, not just for large banks, but smaller banks too. We urge solutions that support and hold banks accountable for their responsibility to adequately respond to these risks. Ensuring reliable and fair products and services Operational resilience is critical for ensuring banks stay in business and continue to provide reliable services, including brick and mortar locations and disaster recovery loans, that many consumers depend on. Regarding safety and soundness, simply put, consumers will be hurt if their banks go under due to climate related shocks. For example, there could be disruptions to consumers’ ability to get paid and pay their bills. There are also other consumer financial protection considerations when looking at transition risks. We are concerned about a lack of access to affordable loans if banks increase their interest rates or pull their services from climate vulnerable areas altogether.
This raises outstanding questions for consumers: Will there be an increase in mortgage application denials? Will banks increase their interest rates in anticipation of demand for climate resiliency or natural disaster recovery loans, or in response to successive natural disasters? Who will be impacted? A September 2021 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report found that climate change not only affects all Americans but poses outsized risks to low-income people and people of color, who are more likely to live in areas projected to be impacted by climate change. Banks should be required to collect data for the purpose of avoiding or addressing negative impacts to consumers. For example, changes in interest rates, loss of revenue from successive climate induced weather events, changes in product offerings and where products are sold, and disparate impacts should be monitored. We encourage the OCC to work with other agencies to assess the needs of community-based banks and available resources to help consumers and communities prepare for and recover from extreme weather events in climate vulnerable communities. Assessing these needs, however, needs to be coupled with slowing down and preventing these risks in the first place. While we recognize the vital role community-based banks play in helping people prepare for and recover from extreme weather events, the costs of climate change should not be offloaded onto consumers. For example, we are aware that in a November 2021 report, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded that weather disasters increase the demand for loans and therefore do not pose much of a risk to banks. However, that means the costs of climate induced weather are being offloaded onto the consumer, which is bad in and of itself. But it’s also not sustainable. For instance, will banks be able to continue issuing home repair loans if the frequency of climate weather events increases and in turn causes customers to come back and apply for multiple loans? Mitigating risks by mitigating global warming Banks ultimately have a role and responsibility to help slow down or prevent the effects of climate change from extreme weather that could lead to financial, safety and soundness, and systemic risks. In addition to the concerns over access to products and services discussed above, consumers face different types of potential risks, including loss of or damage to property, the loss of property value, and possible economic fallout from systemic shocks. In its November 2020 financial stability report, the Federal Reserve brought up the example of increased storm surges from more intense and frequent hurricanes that accompany climate change that could decrease consumer home values and set off a chain reaction. According to
the same report, climate change increases the risks of economic uncertainty and financial shocks to the system. Continued investments in financed emissions, which contribute to climate change and will suffer big losses as the world moves away from carbon energy, put individual financial institutions and our economy at risk. Banks should stop adding fuel to the fire and divest from greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. Every time a bank funds another project that keeps us locked into drilling for, mining for and burning fossil fuels, it just means more lives, homes and communities will be lost or damaged by extreme weather. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), an international coalition of more than 450 banks, insurers, and other asset managers, was launched in April 2021. Coalition members, including nine U.S. banks, have commited to net-zero emissions by 2050. Corresponding with the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), GFANZ members pledged $130 trillion toward a clean energy economy and their net-zero goal. However, the pledge does not include commitments to move away from financing fossil fuel emissions, which ultimately leaves the risks of those emissions unaddressed. While climate solutions are necessary, we can’t afford to let progress on the clean energy front be counteracted by continued fossil fuel emissions. Nor can we “offset” our way out of the problem. Accountability is necessary, as demonstrated by six of the U.S. bank members of GFANZ investing $1.2 trillion in fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Net-zero commitments by banks should be accompanied by measurable, science-based benchmarks, such as a 50% reduction in financed emissions by 2030. Supporting projects that reverse climate change caused by global warming The OCC is in a position to support community-based banks with helping businesses, communities, and consumers live more sustainably and mitigate the impacts of climate change. For example: ● We ask that you provide guidance and best practices that support and encourage loans for projects that fight global warming. ● Banks should be steered away from offering products that are marketed for their purported sustainability benefits but put consumers at risk. ● People should also be able to trust that green investment offerings are not greenwashed. Thank you for addressing the climate financial risk issue and for considering our comments. We look forward to working with you to address the financial risks of climate change, implement the solutions, and support and hold banks accountable for adequately responding to these risks. Please feel free to reach out to Mike Litt at mlitt@pirg.org.

kzh-e6y7-yc7s,"February 10, 2022 Via Online Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 Chief Counsel's Office Attention: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Dear Sir/Madam: On behalf of The Institute of Internal Auditors (The IIA) and our more than 210,000 professional members worldwide, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on OCC’s Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. The IIA believes it is essential to include an independent internal audit function – the third line in The IIA’s Three Lines Model – to provide the necessary independent, internal assurance to boards, management, investors, and stakeholders around climate- related risks and disclosures, as well as related Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) information. This builds trust and confidence in this information, similar to how it already does for financial disclosures. ESG information, including climate disclosures, is rapidly becoming a key determinant of value for all types of organizations – banks included. However, this type of information currently lacks the same level of trust as that of financial information among providers of capital as well as regulators and other key stakeholders. The internal audit function provides the objective internal assurance, independent of management, needed to build confidence in ESG- and climate-related risk and disclosure information, well before that provided by external auditors. Global sustainability standards will likely be offered as early as 2022 by the newly formed International Sustainability Standards Board, an independent board that sits alongside the International Accounting Standards Board at the IFRS Foundation. The internal audit function will test the effectiveness of controls around risk management and the information disclosed according to these standards, and imbue it with the trust needed to assess risk, inform business strategy, and grow value. Banks will disclose their climate-related risk information utilizing these standards – an independent internal audit function will provide the assurance on that information needed by boards, management, investors, and stakeholders. The IIA recommends that the OCC consider this in its Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. In addition to existing OCC rules and guidance, the internal audit profession has received widespread identification and recognition as an important player in the foundation for the safe and sound operation of financial institutions, as summarized below. It is vital that this recognition of the independent internal audit function continue in the management and disclosure of climate-related financial risks. • As part of Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, requiring each Federal banking agency to establish certain safety and soundness standards, the agencies must establish operational and managerial standards relating to internal audit systems with provisions including adequate monitoring of the system of internal controls through an internal audit function, as well as independence, objectivity, and qualification of the internal audit function. • World Bank Group member International Finance Corporation’s corporate governance progression matrix includes the internal audit function in its six key corporate governance parameters. Its recently published ESG Guidebook recommends tasking internal audit with assessing the soundness of the company’s management system. Its ESG GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS I 1035 Greenwood Blvd., Suite 149 I Lake Mary, FL 32746 USA I Phone: +1-407-937-1111
Guidebook also recommends that the set of disclosures includes internal audit responsibilities and reporting lines, as well as the governance and independence of the function. • The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision states that an independent, competent, and qualified internal audit function is vital to the corporate governance process. Basel’s existing principles for enhancing corporate governance and guidance for assessing the effectiveness of the internal audit function already identify and value the role of an organization’s internal audit function. Basel’s principles also highlight that an organization can enhance the ability of its internal audit function by having internal auditors adhere to national and international professional standards, such as the International Professional Practices Framework established by The Institute of Internal Auditors. • The 2022 Ceres Guidance for Engaging on Climate Risk Governance and Voting on Directors outlines its guidance based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Included in this guidance is that audit committees should direct the company’s internal audit department to include, in their respective work scopes, sufficient testing of the impacts of climate change risk on the company’s operations. The Three Lines Model The widely accepted Three Lines Model, updated and published by The IIA in 2020, articulates the core components of effective governance, emphasizing the need for clear roles and responsibilities toward confronting applicable risks, and the crucial importance of effective coordination, communication, and collaboration. Because of its holistic view and understanding of risks across an organization, internal audit is uniquely positioned to provide objective assurance, independent from management, on effective governance structures and systems of internal control (such as those using the COSO Internal Controls - Integrated Framework to manage climate-related financial risks). This assurance, in turn, ensures complete, accurate, and reliable climate-related information, including public disclosures, on which to effectively assess risk, systemic or otherwise, and protect the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial services sector. Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 Following the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, OCC issued in March 2003 the Interagency Policy Statement on the Internal Audit Function and its Outsourcing. The policy statement highlighted that directors and senior management should not rely too much on management self-assessments alone, and that institutions generally should also have their internal controls tested and evaluated by units without business-line responsibilities, such as internal audit groups whose activities are conducted in accordance with professional standards ( The IIA’s International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing are the only global standards for the profession). The policy statement further confirmed the importance of the internal audit function’s independence by recommending the ideal organizational arrangement of the internal audit manager reporting directly and solely to the audit committee regarding both audit issues and administrative matters. OCC Request for Feedback – The IIA’s Responses The attached Annex A details our specifc comments on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, summarized as follows: • Highlight the importance of assurance as an integral part of effective governance and risk management. • Identify the internal audit function as the third key player, in addition to the board and management, in a bank’s three lines of effective governance and risk management. • In alignment with OCC’s Interagency Policy Statement on the Internal Audit Function and its Outsourcing that “directors and senior management should not rely too much on management self-assessments alone,” banks should use objective assurance, independent of management, provided by the bank’s internal audit function. • Banks should seek independent assurance from the bank’s internal audit function to ensure that any public statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements. • Because of internal audit’s holistic view and understanding of risks throughout the organization, the bank’s internal audit function should be identified as a key stakeholder that provides input into the risk identification process. • Validation, provided by the bank’s independent internal audit function, should be a key attribute of quality data. • Internal audit functions should ensure they are considering and incorporating climate-related risks as part of their independent assessment of a bank’s risk assessment as well as their own internal audit planning process.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on the OCC’s Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.

Annex A OCC Request for Feedback – The IIA’s Responses The Institute of Internal Auditors (The IIA), with its more than 210,000 professional members worldwide, offers the following feedback on the OCC’s Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks: “Introduction” This section discusses the potential for weaknesses in a bank’s risk management and control of climate-related financial risks and the potential adverse effects on the safety and soundness of a bank. Key to any risk management framework is independent internal assurance. As such, The IIA recommends the following changes to the language: • Second paragraph: “Weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control and assure the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could adversely affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system.” Additionally, the last paragraph discusses roles and responsibilities of two of the three lines. As stated in The IIA’s newly updated (2020) Three Lines Model, the third key role in effective governance, in addition to the governing body and management, is independent internal assurance provided by an internal audit function operating in conformance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. As such, The IIA recommends the following changes to the language: • Last paragraph: “The OCC plans to elaborate on these principles in subsequent guidance that would distinguish roles and responsibilities of a bank’s three lines (boards of directors (boards), and management and internal audit), incorporate the feedback received on the principles, and consider lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions.” “General Principles: Governance” The “Governance” section of “General Principles” discusses the roles and responsibilities of the board and management relative to the management, mitigation, and control of climate-related risks, yet fails to mention the central role of a bank’s independent internal audit function. It indicates that bank management is responsible for regularly reporting to the board on the level and nature of risks to the bank that could be in conflict with the OCC’s Interagency Policy Statement on the Internal Audit Function and its Outsourcing, which indicates that directors and senior management should not rely too much on management self-assessments alone. Therefore, The IIA recommends adding a sentence at the end of the second paragraph of the “Governance” section of the “General Principles”: • Added sentence, end of second paragraph: “Boards should require that the bank’s internal audit function independently test the effectiveness of controls and review management’s reporting and disclosures on climate- related risks. Boards should rely on this objective assurance, provided independent of management by the bank’s internal audit function, to exercise its duty of overseeing climate-related financial risks.” “General Principles: Strategic Planning” The “Strategic Planning” section of “General Principles” discusses the alignment of risk management with a bank’s strategy. It further notes that a bank should ensure that any public statements about climate-related strategies are aligned with internal strategies and risk appetite. The section fails to suggest how a bank can provide this internal assurance. The IIA recommends modifying the last sentence of the final paragraph of the “Strategic Planning” section of the “General Principles”: • Final paragraph: “In addition, where banks engage in public communication of their climate-related strategies, boards and management should seek independent assurance from the bank’s internal audit function to ensure that any public statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements.” GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS I 1035 Greenwood Blvd., Suite 149 I Lake Mary, FL 32746 USA I Phone: +1-407-937-1111
“General Principles: Risk Management” The “Risk Management” section of “General Principles” discusses a bank’s enterprise risk management framework, including seeking input from key stakeholders, but fails to identify the independent internal audit function as one of these key stakeholders. Because of its holistic view and understanding of risks throughout the bank, internal audit is uniquely positioned to provide this input. The IIA recommends the following changes to the “Risk Management” section of the “General Principles”: • First paragraph: “The risk identification process should include input from stakeholders across the organization with relevant expertise (e.g., business units, independent risk management, and legal, and internal audit). Risk identification includes assessment of climate-related financial risks across a range of plausible scenarios and under various time horizons.” • Added sentence, end of second paragraph: “Banks should engage their internal audit function to provide objective assurance, independent of management, on the effectiveness of the overall risk management framework.” “General Principles: Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting” The “Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting” section of “General Principles” highlights the importance of quality data as a basis for sound decision-making, yet it fails to include some key attributes of quality data. In addition, assurance should be identified as a key capability. The IIA recommends the following changes to the “Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting” section of the “General Principles”: • “Sound climate risk management depends on the availability of relevant, accurate, and timely, complete, and valid data. Management should incorporate climate-related financial risk information into the bank’s internal reporting, monitoring, and escalation processes to facilitate timely and sound decision-making across the bank. Effective risk data aggregation, validation, analysis, and reporting capabilities allow management to capture and report material and emerging climate-related financial risk exposures, segmented or stratified by physical and transition risks, based upon the complexity and types of exposures. Data, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at a rapid pace; management and internal audit should monitor these developments and incorporate them into their climate risk management and assurance as warranted.” “General Principles: Management of Risk Areas” The “Management of Risk Areas” section of “General Principles” discusses the risk assessment process, including the identification of emerging risks. A bank’s independent internal audit function serves a key independent role in governance, risk management, and control and, as such, should be identified as a key role within this section. Internal audit managers should ensure they are considering and incorporating climate-related risks as part of their independent assessment of a bank’s risk assessment as well as their own internal audit planning process. The IIA recommends the following change to the “Management of Risk Areas” section of the “General Principles”: • “A risk assessment process is part of a sound risk governance framework, and allows boards and management to identify emerging risks and to develop and implement appropriate strategies to mitigate those risks. Boards, and management, and internal audit should consider and incorporate climate-related financial risks when identifying, assessing, and mitigating all types of risk. These risk assessment principles describe how climate-related financial risks can be addressed in various risk categories. The OCC will elaborate on these risk assessment principles in subsequent guidance.” GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS I 1035 Greenwood Blvd., Suite 149 I Lake Mary, FL 32746 USA I Phone: +1-407-937-1111","The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) submitted feedback on the OCC's Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. The IIA emphasizes the importance of an independent internal audit function as part of the Three Lines Model to provide assurance on climate-related risks and disclosures. They argue that internal audits build trust in ESG information, which is crucial for value determination. The IIA suggests that internal audits should be recognized as key stakeholders in risk management, providing objective assurance independent of management. They recommend that banks use internal audits to validate climate-related strategies and ensure public statements align with internal strategies. The IIA also highlights the need for internal audits to be involved in data validation and risk assessment processes. They urge the OCC to incorporate these recommendations into their guidance to enhance governance and risk management in banks."
kzh-8gpv-qkal,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. As a citizen who is very concerned about climate crisis we are facing, I appreciate the opportunity to comment.
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change–a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; and make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk, and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The commenter expresses gratitude to Comptroller Hsu for addressing climate change in relation to banks.

kzh-jjr6-yo8o,"Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Introduction The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has identified the effects of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy as presenting emerging risks to banks1 and the financial system.2 Banks are likely to be affected by both the physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change (referred to in these draft principles as climate-related financial risks). Physical risks refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute, climate-related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, and chronic shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. Transition risks refer to stresses to certain banks or sectors arising from the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change. Weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could adversely affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system. Adverse effects could include potentially disproportionate impact on the financially vulnerable, including low- to moderate-income (LMI) and other disadvantaged households and communities.3 Many banks are considering these risks and would benefit from additional guidance as they develop capabilities, deploy resources, and make necessary investments to address climate-related financial risks. These draft principles provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks, consistent with the existing risk management framework described in existing OCC rules and guidance. The principles are intended to support efforts by banks to focus on key aspects of climate risk management. The principles will help bank management make progress toward answering key questions on exposures and incorporating climate-related financial risks into banks’ risk management frameworks. Although all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks, these draft principles are targeted at the largest banks, those with over $100 billion in total 1 In this issuance, the term “bank” refers collectively to national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies of foreign banking organizations. 2 See e.g. Semiannual Risk Perspective at pp. 2-4 (Fall 2021), available at https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications- and-resources/publications/semiannual-risk-perspective/files/pub-semiannual-risk-perspective-fall-2021.pdf. For additional background, see generally Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, Financial Stability Oversight Council (Oct. 21, 2021) (FSOC Climate Report). 3 For further information, see Staff Reports, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Understanding the Linkages between Climate Change and Inequality in the United States, No. 991 (November 2021), available at https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr991.html.
consolidated assets. The OCC is inviting public feedback on the principles for 60 days, until February 14, 2022. The OCC plans to elaborate on these principles in subsequent guidance that would distinguish roles and responsibilities of boards of directors (boards) and management, incorporate the feedback received on the principles, and consider lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions. In keeping with the OCC’s risk-based approach to supervision, the OCC intends to appropriately tailor any resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models. General Principles Governance. An effective risk governance framework is essential to a bank’s safe and sound operation. A bank’s board and management should demonstrate an appropriate understanding of climate-related financial risk exposures and their impact on risk appetite to facilitate oversight. Sound governance includes reviewing information necessary to oversee the bank, allocating appropriate resources, assigning climate-related financial risk responsibilities throughout the organization (i.e., committees, reporting lines, and roles), and clearly communicating to staff regarding climate-related impacts to the bank’s risk profile. Responsibility and accountability may be integrated within existing organizational structures or by establishing new structures for climate-related financial risks. Where dedicated units are established, the board and management should clearly define these units’ responsibilities and interaction with existing governance structures. The board should have adequate understanding and knowledge to assess the potential impact of climate-related risks on the bank and to address and oversee these risks within the bank’s strategy and risk appetite, including an understanding of the potential ways in which these risks could evolve over various time horizons and scenarios. Relevant time horizons may include those that extend beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning horizon. The board should actively oversee the bank’s risk-taking activities and hold management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework. Management is responsible for executing the bank’s overall strategic plan. This responsibility includes effectively managing all risks, including climate- related financial risks, and their effects on the bank’s financial condition. Management should also hold staff accountable for controlling risks within established lines of authority and responsibility. Additionally, management is responsible for regularly reporting to the board on the level and nature of risks to the bank, including climate-related financial risks. Policies, Procedures, and Limits. Management should incorporate climate-related risks into policies, procedures, and limits to provide detailed guidance on the bank’s approach to these risks in line with the strategy and risk appetite set by the board. Policies, procedures, and limits should be modified when necessary to reflect the distinctive characteristics of climate-related risks and changes to the bank’s activities. Strategic Planning. The board and management should consider material climate-related financial risk exposures when setting the bank’s overall business strategy, risk appetite, and financial, capital, and operational plans. As part of forward-looking strategic planning, the board and management should address the potential impact of climate-related financial risk exposures on the bank’s financial condition, operations (including geographic locations), and business 2
objectives over various time horizons. The board and management should also consider climate- related financial risk impacts on stakeholders’ expectations, the bank’s reputation, and LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products and services. The OCC recognizes that the incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time. Any climate-related strategies, including any relevant corporate social responsibility objectives, should align with and support the bank’s broader strategy, risk appetite, and risk management framework. In addition, where banks engage in public communication of their climate-related strategies, boards and management should ensure that any public statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements. Risk Management. Climate-related financial risks typically impact banks through a range of traditional risk types. Management should oversee the development and implementation of processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control climate-related financial risk exposures within the bank’s existing risk management framework. A bank should employ a comprehensive process to identify emerging and material risks stemming from the bank’s business activities and associated exposures. The risk identification process should include input from stakeholders across the organization with relevant expertise (e.g., business units, independent risk management, and legal). Risk identification includes assessment of climate-related financial risks across a range of plausible scenarios and under various time horizons. As part of sound risk management, banks should develop processes to measure and monitor material climate-related financial risks and to inform management about the materiality of those risks. Material climate-related financial risk exposures should be clearly defined, aligned with the bank’s risk appetite, and supported by appropriate metrics (e.g., risk limits and key risk indicators) and escalation processes. Boards and management should also incorporate climate- related risks into their internal control frameworks, including internal audit. Tools and approaches for measuring and monitoring exposure to climate-related risks include, among others, exposure analysis, heat maps, climate risk dashboards, and scenario analysis. These tools can be leveraged to assess a bank’s exposure to both physical and transition risks in both the shorter and longer term. Outputs should inform the risk identification process and the short- and long-term financial risks to a bank’s business model from climate change. Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting. Sound climate risk management depends on the availability of relevant, accurate, and timely data. Management should incorporate climate- related financial risk information into the bank’s internal reporting, monitoring, and escalation processes to facilitate timely and sound decision-making across the bank. Effective risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities allow management to capture and report material and emerging climate-related financial risk exposures, segmented or stratified by physical and transition risks, based upon the complexity and types of exposures. Data, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at a rapid pace; management should monitor these developments and incorporate them into their climate risk management as warranted. 3
Scenario Analysis. Climate-related scenario analysis is emerging as an important approach for identifying, measuring, and managing climate-related risks. For the purposes of this guidance, climate-related scenario analysis refers to exercises used to conduct a forward-looking assessment of the potential impact on a bank of changes in the economy, financial system, or the distribution of physical hazards resulting from climate-related risks. These exercises differ from traditional stress testing exercises that typically assess the potential impacts of transitory shocks to near-term economic and financial conditions. An effective climate-related scenario analysis framework provides a comprehensive and forward-looking perspective that banks can apply alongside existing risk management practices to evaluate the resiliency of a bank’s strategy and risk management to the structural changes arising from climate-related risks. Management should develop and implement climate-related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile. These frameworks should include clearly defined objectives that reflect the bank’s overall climate risk management strategies. These objectives could include, for example, exploring the impacts of climate-related risks on the bank’s strategy and business model, identifying and measuring vulnerability to relevant climate-related risk factors including physical and transition risks, and estimating climate-related exposures and potential losses across a range of plausible scenarios. In the near term, a climate-related scenario analysis framework can also assist the bank in identifying data and methodological limitations and uncertainty in climate risk management and informing the adequacy of its climate risk management framework. Climate-related scenario analyses should be subject to oversight, validation, and quality control standards that would be commensurate to their risk. Climate-related scenario analysis results should be clearly and regularly communicated to all relevant individuals within the bank, including an appropriate level of information necessary to effectively convey the assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty of results. Management of Risk Areas A risk assessment process is part of a sound risk governance framework, and it allows boards and management to identify emerging risks and to develop and implement appropriate strategies to mitigate those risks. Boards and management should consider and incorporate climate-related financial risks when identifying and mitigating all types of risk. These risk assessment principles describe how climate-related financial risks can be addressed in various risk categories. The OCC will elaborate on these risk assessment principles in subsequent guidance. Credit Risk. The board and management should consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios. Effective credit risk management practices could include monitoring climate-related credit risks through sectoral, geographic, and single-name concentration analyses, including credit risk concentrations stemming from physical and transition risks. As part of concentration risk analysis, management should assess potential changes in correlations across exposures or asset classes. The board and management should determine credit risk appetite and lending limits related to these risks. 4
Liquidity Risk. Consistent with sound oversight and liquidity risk management, the board and management should assess whether climate-related financial risks could affect liquidity buffers and, if so, incorporate those risks into their liquidity risk management and liquidity buffers. Other Financial Risk. Management should monitor interest rate risk and other model inputs for greater volatility or less predictability due to climate-related financial risks. Where appropriate, management should include corresponding measures of conservatism in their risk measurements and controls. The board and management should monitor how climate-related financial risks affect the bank’s exposure to risk related to changing prices. While market participants are still researching how to measure climate price risk, the board and management should use the best measurement methodologies reasonably available to them and refine them over time. Operational Risk. The board and management should consider how climate-related financial risk exposures may adversely impact a bank’s operations, control environment, and operational resilience. Sound operational risk management includes incorporating an assessment across all business lines and operations, including third-party operations, and considering climate-related impacts on business continuity and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape. Legal/Compliance Risk. The board and management should consider how climate-related financial risks and risk mitigation measures affect the legal and regulatory landscape in which the bank operates. This consideration includes possible changes to legal requirements for, or underwriting considerations related to, flood or disaster-related insurance. It also includes possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity. Other Nonfinancial Risk. Consistent with sound oversight, the board and management should monitor how the execution of strategic decisions and the operating environment affect the bank’s financial condition and operational resilience as discussed in the strategic planning section. The board and management should also consider the extent to which the bank’s activities may increase the risk of negative financial impact from reputational damage, liability, or litigation, and implement adequate measures to account for these risks where material. Request for Feedback The OCC welcomes feedback on all aspects of these draft principles, including on the following questions. Among other uses, the OCC would consider responses in connection with developing any future guidance on climate-related financial risks. Refer to OCC Bulletin 2021-62 for instructions on submitting feedback. Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? 5

How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? 4 “Green bonds” refer to fixed-income securities, the proceeds of which are earmarked for environmentally beneficial investment. 6
Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? 7","The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has proposed draft principles for managing climate-related financial risks in large banks, emphasizing the need for effective governance, strategic planning, and risk management. These principles address both physical risks (e.g., hurricanes, floods) and transition risks (e.g., policy shifts) associated with climate change. The OCC highlights the importance of integrating climate risks into banks' existing risk management frameworks, including governance, policies, strategic planning, and scenario analysis. The draft principles are targeted at banks with over $100 billion in assets, aiming to support their efforts in managing climate risks. The OCC seeks public feedback on these principles to refine future guidance, considering banks' size, complexity, and risk profiles. The proposal also addresses the potential disproportionate impact on financially vulnerable communities and emphasizes the need for banks to consider climate risks in credit, liquidity, operational, and legal risk management. The OCC invites feedback on various aspects, including applicability, challenges, tools, and data needs, to enhance banks' climate risk management practices."

Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk.
The claim of reducing ""climate intensity"" as a measure of compliance must be rejected. It is far too late for that to be a useful measure of financial climate benefit. Divestment from and minimizing of climate risk must be real, measurable outcomes of this policy.

kzh-os1v-qa8w,"Climate Change is a huge topic.  Banking Regulations to manage proper risk management during a world-wide crisis is a task beyond me, and most of us.  Therefore, my comments are  at a high level.  If regulators implement strategies consistent with high-level reality, some good should result.       Since biblical times and before, humans were astute observers of their world.  They saw a ""limited goods"" paradigm where stability was a goal.  Their goal was usually ""honor,""  not wealth.  A saying: ""A rich man is either a thief, or the son of a thief.""  Castes were true in many societies, like India's.  Society cruised from generation with little change.  Change began about 1450 with the invention of movable type and the mass production of information. (Ts'ai Lun, inventer of paper, and Johann Gutenberg are rated #6 and #7 as the most infulential people in history--Michael H. Hart: THE 100.)  Isaac Newton triggered another change in 1687 describing physics and the calculus (he is #2 on Hart's THE 100).  Move forward to 1776: A group (#26 & 64) invented democracy, James Watt (#22) installed his first rotary steam engine, starting the Industrial revolution, and Adam Smith (#30) defined capitalism.  Each of these contributed to climate change, starting so slowly that the cumulative impact was not recognized until THE LIMITS TO GROWTH (1972) was published about two centuries later.  The triple momentum increase of self-government, stored energy capture, and fake but self-serving economics has put us on a new path to self-destruction.        Religion has been part of cultural development for at least 1000 generations.  ""Territoriality"" has also molded human behavior for much longer.  Human behavior today is a combination of what we have learned through our cultures (which can be unlearned and relearned) and behavior embedded in our genes through natural selection.  Economist Jeffrey D. Sachs describes territoriality in just two sentences:   “Since the great dispersal from Africa [about 70,000 years ago], and surely before that within Africa, human groups have battled each other for territory and to secure their basic survival needs (including water, food supplies, shelter and minerals).  Indeed, human nature was forged in the cauldron of territorial competition, which instilled in our genes and our cultures a remarkable ability to cooperate within a group, combined with a deeply rooted tendency toward conflict and distrust between groups (according to race, religion, language, national origin, and other markers of identity).”          Territories are dominated by the alpha males who stake them out.  He permits cooperating males to remain; competitive males are ejected from the group, and their survivability without group protection declines drastically.  Therefore loyalty to the alpha male leader is paramount.  A modern example of territorial behavior is Donald Trump, who cowed his entire group, Republicans, into mindless support.  Note also that the captains of industry are typically alpha males as CEOs of corporations, the foundation of capitalism. Capitalism is a deeply flawed economic system based of flawed assumptions, and seeking inequality between its alpha male owners and their workers, who, in most cases, are the major capital.  It assumes natural capital has no value, and pollution has no cost.  The stock market is fake, and will crash as soon as people realize most stock represents expectations, not value.  Banks are at the top of the vulnerability list.  Capitalism will also crash because its basic assumption, that growth has no limit, violates the laws of physics, and in particular the laws of conservation of mass, energy and momentum.  The momentum (mass times velocity) of the economy is limited when the mass of humanity stops growing.  The population has already overshot its sustainable limits, and collapse will come shortly.  From a physics point of view, Covid-19 helped.  From a social point of view, Covid is a nightmare.         Bottom line: you have your work cut out.  My advice: Hire Jeffrey D. Sachs.  He understand the world very well.  Do not trust energy or capital (bank) capitalists.  Alpha males typically look out for themselves first. John W (Elders Climate Action-Oregon)","The comment discusses the historical and cultural evolution of human society and its impact on climate change and economic systems. It highlights the shift from stability-focused societies to those driven by capitalism and industrialization, which have contributed to climate change. The author critiques capitalism as a flawed system that values inequality and disregards natural resources and pollution costs. The comment also touches on human territorial behavior, likening it to modern political and corporate leadership, particularly criticizing figures like Donald Trump and corporate CEOs as ""alpha males."" The author suggests that the current economic model is unsustainable and predicts a collapse due to overpopulation and resource limits. The comment concludes by advising regulators to hire economist Jeffrey D. Sachs for his understanding of global issues and warns against trusting capitalists focused on energy and banking."

Research on the impact on public health is closing in on proving links to cancer and progressive respiratory diseases from pollutants released in the air and affecting ground water in population far downstream from the destruction. It's time for banks to stop lending money to energy industries which are destroying the environment, causing near populations to fall terminally ill, all for an extractive industry whose reserves are depleting.

Thank you for this draft guidance for banks to responsibly address the risks of the climate crisis in carrying out their business. This measure is a good first step to force banks to reckon with the climate change risks and be transparent about what they are really doing in this area.  Please stand firm and resist efforts by the banks and fossil fuels lobbyists to dilute this guidance.

I support the proposed guidance recommendations to banks that they incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business and make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate statements.  Recently, I reviewed my retirement accounts with a large financial institution to make sure that my portfolio was sound, well balanced and free of fossil fuels companies - as I am about to retire.  I had to dig to get the information on fossil fuels investments in the fund and was aghast to find out there was a sizable amount invested in fossil fuels companies.  Putting aside the morality of continuing to invest in an industry that is destroying our communities and planet, how could this be prudent investing from a financial perspective?  At a minimum, banks must be forced to clearly disclose to their customers the fossil fuels involvement in the products they are offering.  I certainly don't want to have my life's savings be used by banks to continue enabling the fossil fuels industry.  I should not have to spend hours trying to figure this out.

kzi-kg0l-hsjv,"February 11, 2022 Chief Counsel’s Office Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks To Whom It May Concern: On behalf of the Center for American Progress, I write to comment on the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) request for information titled Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (RFI).1 We greatly appreciate the OCC’s leadership in developing this document and for providing the opportunity to comment. The OCC has rightly recognized the “effects of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy as presenting emerging risks to banks and the financial system,” and that “[w]eaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could adversely affect a bank’s safety and soundness.” When building on the principles articulated in the RFI in subsequent guidance in the future, the OCC should: • apply its principles to all banks; • issue tailored guidance when appropriate; • ensure examiners’ interactions with banks on climate risks is tailored; • confirm banks adhere to their public climate commitments; • allow banks to only use carbon offsets that are substantiated to meet environmental commitments; • ensure banks provide fair and equitable access to financial services; • require large- and mid-size regional banks to engage in scenario analyses; and • help banks collect adequate data to analyze their climate risks. Scope of the principles Although the OCC limits its principles for climate-related financial risk management to institutions “with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets,” the principles themselves are sufficiently high-level to apply to all banks, regardless of size, location, and business model. For example, the OCC explains that “a bank’s board and management should demonstrate an appropriate understanding of climate-related financial risk exposures and 1 Comptroller of the Currency, “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks,” December 16, 2021, available at https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021- 62a.pdf.
their impact on risk appetite to facilitate oversight,” as well as that “a bank should employ a comprehensive process to identify emerging and material risks stemming from the bank’s business activities and associated exposures.” The OCC notes that “all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks,” and the principles articulated apply just as much to a bank with $500 billion in assets as a bank with $50 billion or $5 billion. While the OCC should apply the principles to all banks, it should differentiate in the implementation of these principles. Implementation will clearly differ based on factors the OCC listed (i.e., asset size, location, business model) and others. Tailored guidance As the OCC articulates new climate related principles and expectations for how banks will implement those principles, it should consider (on a document-by-document basis) whether or how those principles or expectations may be tailored to banks’ business lines or sizes. The OCC should also consider whether banks with particular business lines or banks that operate in particular locations require tailored guidance. For example, banks with high concentrations of mortgage loans will have different risk profiles from banks with high concentrations of agricultural loans, and banks with high concentrations of mortgage loans in one area of the country will have different risk profiles from banks in others. The OCC should tailor its expectations for how banks will mitigate their risks faced, and it would be appropriate for the OCC to issue guidance specifying what those tailored expectations are. Examiners’ interactions with banks Just as the OCC should tailor its written guidance, its examiners’ interactions with banks should be similarly tailored. Some of the largest institutions are keenly aware of their climate risks and began taking steps to mitigate those risks even before the OCC issued its guidance.2 For these institutions, examiners’ climate-related responsibilities should be focused on, for example, ensuring that banks’ managements have put forth policies and procedures based on the most recent science, and that staff comply with those policies and procedures. However, for smaller institutions that may not have the resources to begin adapting to the realities of climate change, examiners should have conversations with banks’ boards and management so that they understand their institutions face climate- related risks and have basic information as to the range of possible responses. Banks’ public commitments We strongly support the OCC’s statement that, “where banks engage in public communication of their climate-related strategies, boards and management should ensure that any public statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements.” Although the OCC cannot legally mandate that banks make specific public commitments regarding their loan portfolios, it should ensure that banks articulate measurable targets and take the steps necessary to adhere to those targets when commitments are made. 2 For example, six U.S. headquartered global systemically important banks have joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. See Net-Zero Banking Alliance, “Members,” (last accessed February 7, 2022), available at https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/members/.
When a bank fails to adhere to its public commitments on climate change, it faces losses for both reputational and legal reasons. First, banks that make extensive climate commitments, such as commitments to be net zero by 2050, may lose customers if they fail to make significant progress on those commitments, as individuals who choose where to bank based on climate pledges may move their business away from institutions that fail to make progress on their commitments. Second, publicly traded banks that make climate commitments may face litigation under the securities laws for making materially false statements if they similarly fail to make significant progress on those commitments. To help banks avoid losses from these risks, the OCC should make clear that banks that make public climate commitments must develop and implement credible strategies for fulfilling those commitments. Importantly, those strategies should not rely on carbon offsets, which are “tradable ‘rights’ or certificates linked to activities that lower the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.”3 Not only is there deep concern that many carbon offsets, as currently designed, do not work,4 but regulators with jurisdiction over carbon markets may bring enforcement actions against sellers of offsets for fraud, severely limiting the supply and increasing the price of legitimate offsets.5 To the extent banks wish to rely on carbon offsets to meet their commitments, the OCC should ensure that efforts are in place to substantiate that those offsets result in the removal of carbon from the atmosphere. Fair and equitable access to financial services The OCC’s principles note that climate change “could include potentially disproportionate impact on the financially vulnerable, including low- to moderate-income (LMI) and other disadvantaged households and communities,” and, accordingly, it is especially important that the OCC help ensure banks continue to provide services to these households and communities. Although there may be additional means of tackling this, the OCC should take two specific actions. First, it should issue guidance detailing how banks may continue extending credit to vulnerable communities in a safe and sound manner. The OCC should particularly focus on how banks may lend for the purchase and installation of residential solar panels, which are the types of high-dollar, long-term loans that bank examiners are traditionally reticent for banks to make. Second, the OCC should work with the other federal banking agencies to update their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules to ensure that credit flows to LMI and other disadvantaged communities to help reduce their fossil fuel emissions and to protect themselves from climate impacts. Currently, banking deserts–often in central cities and rural areas–are excluded from the benefits promised by the CRA because they are not in any institution’s assessment area. The OCC should update its CRA regulations to ensure that banks with a nationwide presence direct investment into all underserved 3 See e.g., Angelo Gurgel, “Carbon Offsets,” MIT Climate Portal, September 11, 2020, available at https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/carbon-offsets. 4 See e.g., Lisa Song and Paula Moura, “An Even More Inconvenient Truth: Why Carbon Credits for Forest Preservation May Be Worse Than Nothing,” ProPublica, May 22, 2019, available at https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work- deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/. 5 Todd Phillips, “A Climate and Competition Agenda for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,” American Progress, February 1, 2022, available at https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-climate-and- competition-agenda-for-the-commodity-futures-trading-commission/ (“The CFTC has jurisdiction over carbon offsets through its authority to address fraud and market manipulation in spot commodity markets…and it can hold offset issuers accountable if they promise carbon reductions that do not, or simply cannot, occur.”).
communities, not only those surrounding physical branches. Further, the OCC should explore a climate resilience and environmental justice finance mandate for the CRA, which would give banks credit for providing loans for projects such as energy efficient and climate resilient affordable housing, installation of community solar energy projects, and others.6 Scenario analyses and data collection When developing climate scenario analysis guidance, we encourage the OCC to keep in mind several key points.7 First, we note that it is not necessary for the OCC’s initial guidance or scenarios to be perfect. Scenario analysis is an evolving effort that will improve after each iteration. Rather, it is important for banks to begin conducting their analyses quickly in order to learn from them. We recommend the OCC utilize the scenarios for the National Climate Assessment as a basis for its initial scenarios,8 as well as resources developed by other federal agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency’s summaries of research investigating the sectoral impacts of climate change.9 Second, in addition to banks with assets above $100 billion, mid-size, regional banks should be required to undertake climate-related scenario analyses as well. Regional bank, with portfolios that may not be as diversified as those of larger banks, may experience higher rates of failure and branch closures as a consequence of natural disasters that affect only one part of the nation. Accordingly, safety and soundness concerns necessitate climate scenario analyses for mid-size institutions, though those analyses may not need to be as rigorous as the ones for larger banks so long as they help banks gain a better understanding of the climate risks they face. Third, the OCC should ensure that banks collect or otherwise have access to the data necessary to understand their portfolios’ and operations’ climate risks and adapt accordingly. The OCC should provide guidance detailing best practices for collecting or otherwise obtaining climate-related data. The OCC should also engage with the Securities and Exchange Commission in its forthcoming climate change disclosure rule to help ensure that banks which hold debt or equity of public companies can use that information to understand their portfolio risks.10 *** 6 See generally Michela Zonta and Caius Willingham, “A CRA To Meet the Challenge of Climate Change,” American Progress, December 17, 2020, available at https://www.americanprogress.org/article/cra-meet- challenge-climate-change/. 7 The OCC’s principles describe “climate-related scenario analysis” as “exercises used to conduct a forward- looking assessment of the potential impact on a bank of changes in the economy, financial system, or the distribution of physical hazards resulting from climate-related risks.” 8 U.S. Global Change Research Program, “Scenarios for the National Climate Assessment,” (last accessed February 7, 2022), available at https://scenarios.globalchange.gov/. 9 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, “Technical Documentation on The Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI)” at 15–16, October 2021, available at https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-10/technical-documentation-on-the-framework-for- evaluating-damages-and-impacts_maintext.pdf. 10 RIN: 3235-AM87, (last accessed February 7, 2022), available at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202110&RIN=3235-AM87.

kzi-ktuc-vybx,"Comptroller Hsu,I have been alerted to your request for comments from the American public by an alliance of concerned citizens, or a citizens lobby, Elders for Climate Action.  Although my concerns and the details as they apply to your agency may be similar when others of us contact you, this does not mean that you can nor should you disregard our concerns.    I am a grandmother who has been working for the climate since the first Earth Day at my Aurora, Colorado high school in 1970.  Although there were so many times the USA could have begun to mitigate the damage caused by fossil fuel burning, we have only allowed things to get worse and worse until now we are running out of time.  Therefore, I urge you to consider the points in this comment even if others contact you with the same talking points.  I am very concerned about climate change and the lack of effort by our financial institutions to face this threat honestly and responsibly, and I thank you for this draft guidance. It outlines a framework for robust assessment, disclosure, and risk management that will force banks to reckon with climate change risk. I urge you to resist all efforts to dilute this guidance and to follow up with scope and details as broad as OCC’s authority allows. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change–a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance recommendations to banks that they incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business, plan for climate change over a long time horizon and update models as additional data becomes available, develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting limits, and make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interests of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The commenter, a member of Elders for Climate Action, expresses deep concern about climate change and the role of financial institutions in exacerbating the crisis. They emphasize the need for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to enforce robust climate risk management guidelines for banks. The commenter highlights the discrepancy between banks' public commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and their continued investments in fossil fuels, which disproportionately affect marginalized communities. They support the proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management into all business levels, plan for long-term climate impacts, and ensure internal strategies align with public climate commitments. The commenter urges the OCC to use its authority to issue strong guidance, protect against unsafe banking practices, and require banks to take necessary actions to minimize climate risk.

kzj-igte-41ij,"I am a retired professor of education, and I've studied and taught about the nature of value and the value of diversity in economics, ethics, and education. I devote my time now to the money question, and I am striving, with others, to ""end banking,"" banking defined as McMillan (2014) does as ""the creation of money out of credit"" (pp. 3, 6, 179; see also pp. 21, 31, 37, 56, 58, 113, 115, 140, 159, & 179). 
That is, we need much more out of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency than asking banks to track and account for the risks caused by climate change. We need to supersede what we currently use as money--which is private interest-bearing credit created by commercial banks via keystrokes when we agree to pay them that amount over time with interest--with a public asset created and spent, lent, given, or invested into circulation for the public good by the people through our democratically elected representatives. Doing so would eliminate the growth imperative that is leading to the climate change and environmental crises that your ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks"" are merely trying to account for. That is their shortcoming. It is too little too late. 
That said, these principles ARE needed and warranted today. They definitely need to be implemented not merely to secure the bottom line of the banks and of the people whose deposits reside under their auspices, but also to put attention on the detrimental consequences for all, including banks, of our blind and exploitive profit-driven practices that are polluting and destroying the natural environment and gift economy that, last I looked, you and I and all of us depend upon for our lives. 
But your new principles do not go far enough. Why are you only requiring banks to factor in the risks exacerbated by climate change rather than requiring them at least not to increase those risks by their investments and, preferably, to mitigate against them? It is not like the lives of your grandchildren and mine do not depend upon us stopping business as usual. They do. And the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is a public agency that can and should lead the way, and if--or when--existing law under the Federal Reserve Act gets in your way from stopping banks from creating via interest-bearing loans what we use as legal tender, then you must work to get Congress to change that law. Only then will your ""principles for climate-related financial risk management"" hold water and credibility with the 99%, not just of the US but of the global monetary system that, after WWII, we've made subservient to our Federal Reserve Note. 
Thank you for requesting public comment and considering mine.","The commenter, a retired professor of education, argues for a fundamental change in the monetary system, criticizing the current practice of banks creating money through credit.

The corrupting influence of money in our political system is undermining our democratic traditions and discouraging Americans from voting and/or running for office.  This ominous development may well end our experiment in representative democracy unless we alter this decades-long trend.  For the sake of the republic, we must amend the US Constitution to state that corporations are not people (and do not have constitutional rights) and money is not speech (and thus can be regulated by state and/or federal campaign finance laws).  Short of accomplishing this, no other reform of significance will be achieved.  The moneyed interests will turn any reform to their benefit, often at the expense of the nation as a whole.","The comment addresses the issue of climate change and banks, thanking Comptroller Hsu for addressing it. It criticizes banks for investing in fossil fuels despite public claims of addressing climate change, highlighting the risks to the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet.

Big banks as well as the companies that produce fossil fuels are part of society and must take their share of responsibility for limiting climate change. It is immoral to claim that profit is more important than preserving a viable climate for all people. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels.

	 THE CLEAN ENERGY TAX CREDITS IN BBB WILL MORE THAN PAY FOR THEMSELVES
The President’s proposed clean energy tax credits, which would incentivize the U.S. power industry to generate more electricity through wind, solar, and other zero-carbon resources, are the part of BBB most likely to get through Congress. A new analysis issued Feb. 9, 2022 from the University of Chicago and the Rhodium Group finds that the proposed tax credits would be one of the most cost-effective climate policies in American history. The report projects economic benefits totaling three to four times the costs, creating up to $1.5 trillion in economic surplus. At their peak, the credits will eliminate 33 to 45 percent of carbon emissions from the U.S. electricity sector. Additionally, these carbon savings in the electricity generation sector will flow through the entire system; for example, electric vehicles will be truly clean if they charge with clean electricity.","The comment expresses strong support for Comptroller Hsu's draft guidance on climate risk management for financial institutions.

It is essential that we Stop the Money Pipeline. Banks now have the opportunity of changing how they do things, by putting money into renewable energy instead of into fossil fuels. Fossil fuels produce large quantities of carbon dioxide when burned. Carbon emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to climate change. When fossil fuels are burned, they also release nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain.

2 This comment letter responds to a request for feedback from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.1 It is organized as follows: Summary I. Introduction. II. Climate Uncertainties and Choices Among Crucial Assumptions. III. The Evidence on Climate Phenomena and the Effects of Climate Policies in the EPA Climate Model. IV. Further Observations on the Concept of “Climate Risk.” V. Conclusions. Summary • No financial institution nor few, if any, government agencies are in a position to evaluate climate phenomena, whether ongoing or prospective, with respect to which the scientific uncertainties are vastly greater than commonly asserted. • The range of alternative assumptions about central parameters is too great to yield clear implications for the climate “risks” facing specific financial institutions, economic sectors, and geographic regions. • Those central parameters include the choices among climate models, the assumed sensitivity of the climate system to increases in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG), ensuing conclusions about the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic influences upon climate phenomena, the assumed future increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations through, say, 2100, and the analytic assumptions underlying calculations of the effects of aerosol emissions on cloud formation, about which surprisingly little is known. That short list is far from exhaustive. • If large banks are driven to use the same (or similar) sets of assumptions about central parameters, a very real danger would arise of more-or-less homogeneous predictions inconsistent with historical, ongoing, and prospective climate phenomena. If they opt to use sets of assumptions that differ in important dimensions, the ensuing predictions about future climate phenomena (“risks”) would vary substantially, yielding very large uncertainties in terms of the information made available to investors and regulators. • It is reasonable to hypothesize that financial institutions driven to evaluate climate “risks” will have powerful incentives to undertake climate analysis driven not by the actual evidence and the peer-reviewed literature on climate phenomena. Instead, they will be driven to undertake such analysis, whether in response to regulatory directives or to political pressures, under assumptions and methodologies insulating them from adverse regulatory actions, litigation threats, and political pressures. • It is reasonable to hypothesize also that the aggregate, sectoral, and geographic benefits (that is, positive “risks”) of increasing GHG concentrations, as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in the peer-reviewed literature, will 1 See https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62a.pdf.
3 be excluded from such analytic efforts. • It is reasonable to hypothesize further that such analyses will exclude the risks of climate policies, prominent among which are the large and adverse implications of artificial increases in energy costs. Such policy risks are likely to be greater when implemented by regulatory agencies insulated from democratic accountability. • Anthropogenic climate change is “real” in that increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHG have yielded effects that are detectable. But they are much smaller than commonly asserted; and there is no evidence in support of the ubiquitous assertions of a climate “crisis,” whether ongoing or looming, and no evidence in support of the even more extreme “existential threat” argument. Moreover, the available analysis suggests that the financial risks of anthropogenic climate change in the aggregate are much smaller than many assert. • Both the central integrated assessment model and the IPCC in its most alarmist analyses calculate that anthropogenic climate change unmitigated by policy initiatives would reduce global per capita incomes by less than 1.5 percent by the end of this century, at which time the world is certain to be vastly wealthier than now. • The mainstream climate models have a poor track record in terms of predicting the actual temperature trend of recent decades, having consistently overstated that trend by a factor of over two. • Application of the Environmental Protection Agency climate model suggests strongly that climate policies, whether implemented by the U.S. government alone or as an international cooperative policy, would have temperature effects by 2100 that would be virtually undetectable or very small. Such policies cannot satisfy any plausible benefit/cost test. • Because the perceived “climate “risks” confronting financial institutions are dependent upon crucial choices among alternative assumptions, the evaluation of such “risks” would be largely arbitrary given that the “correct” assumptions are very far from obvious. A misallocation of capital is a likely result, which means that a requirement, whether formal or informal, that climate “risks” be evaluated would be likely to weaken the pursuit of the safety, soundness, and systemic stability objectives that are the formal mandates for the OCC. • When “risk” analysis becomes an arbitrary function of choices among assumptions complex, opaque, and far from obvious, the traditional safety, soundness, and systemic stability objectives that are the formal mandates for the OCC inexorably will be diluted and rendered far less useful for the investment and capital markets, an outcome diametrically at odds with the ostensible objectives of those advocating the evaluation of climate “risks.” Moreover, the “risks” of anthropogenic climate change are far from the only such mass-geography “risks.” A bias toward focusing only on climate “risks” would distort the allocation of capital. • For all of these reasons, the preliminary (or draft) principles for climate risk analysis published recently by the OCC are deeply problematic, as they shunt aside the massive analytic problems inherent in the analysis of climate “risk.” It is perhaps unsurprising that regulators view market incentives as insufficient to engender an efficient outcome in terms of resource allocation, and that a regulatory strengthening of such incentives automatically would yield an allocational improvement. That stance is very far from obviously correct.
4 • The combination of very great climate uncertainties and litigation and regulatory threats will create a demand from the banking sector for detailed regulations on how to structure the analysis of climate risks. Because the uncertainties attendant upon the future effects of increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHG are so great, a top-down regulatory approach for the evaluation of any attendant “risks” is itself very risky. A wiser approach would entail allowing market forces to make such “risk” determinations in a bottom-up fashion, thus avoiding an obvious politicization of the allocation of capital. • Proposals that the OCC enforce a mandate that large banks evaluate climate “risks” represent a blatant effort to distort the allocation of capital away from economic sectors disfavored by certain political interest groups pursuing ideological agendas. This would represent the return of Operation Choke Point, a past attempt to politicize access to capital, one deeply corrosive of our legal and constitutional institutions. • Protection of those institutions is consistent only with formal policymaking by the Congress through enactment of legislation, rather than with powerful pressures, whether formal or informal, exerted by regulatory agencies. This institutional protection would preserve the traditional roles of the private sector and of the government, respectively, as part of the larger permanent objectives of maximizing the productivity of resource use under free market competition, and of preserving the political accountability of the policymaking process under the institutions of democratic decisionmaking as constrained by the constitution. I. Introduction The draft principles under consideration by the OCC for climate-related financial risk management by large banks assume that the evaluation of such “risks” — that is, a disaggregation of overall climate phenomena affected by increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases by sector and by geographic region — would be straightforward. Instead, even at the global level, the uncertainties are staggering, in particular for the evaluation of climate phenomena decades or centuries in the future.2 Disaggregation of such analysis by economic sector and geographic region would be fraught with uncertainties and a requirement for choices among alternative assumptions even greater. The proposed requirement that “a bank’s board and management… demonstrate an appropriate understanding of climate-related financial risk exposures and the impact on risk appetite…” simultaneously is preposterous in that bank officials are in no position to evaluate the enormous complexities of climate science, and also is curiously unhelpful in that the phrase “appropriate understanding” is devoid of useful definition. Moreover, the concept of “systemic risk” can be defined in a number of alternative ways, some of which conflict, and regulators have not demonstrated that they have mastered the task of deducing the “systemic risks” engendered by a large and complex series of risks confronting individual financial institutions.3 The massive uncertainties and analytic difficulties inherent in any such assessments of 2 See, e.g., Figure SPM.2 in “The Physical Science Basis” section of the most recent IPCC report, at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf. 3 See, e.g., https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/newsevents/events/research/2006/0518-background.pdf and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279977936_The_Concept_of_Systemic_Risk.
5 “financial risks” created by changing climate phenomena will drive bank managements to outsource such risk analysis to outside consultants, the choices among whom will be driven not by any goal of analytic rigor, but instead by a heavy potential for regulatory and litigation penalties. Accordingly, only the most extreme scenarios will be viewed as relevant, a methodology that will distort the allocation of capital, and, perhaps ironically, will have the effect of weakening the financial performance of the banks forced into such analytic biases, and therefore of increasing the systemic risks, however defined, confronting the financial sector writ large. For the OCC, a regulatory framework that engenders such outcomes and with them a weaker U.S. economy in the aggregate is deeply inappropriate. The combination of very great climate uncertainties and the litigation and regulatory threats will create a demand from the business sector for detailed regulations on how to structure the analysis of climate risks. Regulatory agencies are hardly better suited to conduct such analysis in an objective and neutral manner. Both large banks and government agencies will have powerful incentives to use the Environmental Protection Agency climate model, used by most federal agencies to evaluate climate trends and the effects of climate policies; precisely because it is the U.S. government model, it would be difficult to attack a financial institution for choosing it.4 For the earlier suite of climate models (CMIP-5), the EPA model provided predictions close to the average of those models under a given set of underlying assumptions, equilibrium climate sensitivity in particular. For the new suite (CMIP-6), the EPA model provides predictions cooler than the average of those models, not because the EPA model now is providing predictions more consistent with the historical evidence, but because the CMIP-6 models have incorporated a range of climate sensitivity assumptions and estimates higher on average than those in the CMIP-5 iteration. That range of climate sensitivity values in CMIP-6 also is wider than that in CMIP-5, meaning that the uncertainty of the climate models is increasing. Furthermore, large low-probability risks are ubiquitous. Wars, terrorist acts, meteor strikes, mass volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, adverse weather events, and the like are only the beginning of a long list that does not require an overactive imagination to construct. For the OCC, a focus on only a small subset of such potential risks is arbitrary: Why some — or, indeed, only one — and not others? For the banks, a focus on that small subset as mandated by regulatory imperatives again creates a likelihood of a substantial misallocation of capital, weaker financial performance, and another ironic increase in systemic risks. And again for the OCC: a regulatory framework that engenders such outcomes and with them a weaker U.S. economy in the aggregate is deeply inappropriate. The OCC should abandon this effort to force large banks to evaluate climate risks — to conduct highly complex and uncertain analyses that they are in no position to undertake — and return to its traditional functions of ensuring safety and soundness. 4 This is the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC), at www.magic.org. The summary analysis presented below uses version 5.3. Version 6.0 is available, but generates predictions only on the temperature effects of various GHG concentration scenarios.
6 II. Climate Uncertainties and Choices Among Crucial Assumptions Notwithstanding ubiquitous assertions that climate science is “settled,” that a crisis is upon us or looming large, and that government policies must address the “existential threat” posed by anthropogenic climate change, in reality the uncertainties attendant upon the prospective effects of increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) are very substantial. Moreover, no evidence supports the “crisis” narrative, as discussed below. These realities are illustrated by the ranges of various estimates published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its most recent Assessment Report, by the wide range of temperature paths projected by the mainstream climate models, and by the scientific literature more generally.5 The evaluation of climate “risks” to large banks would require choices among the available climate models, choices among alternative assumptions about the path of future atmospheric concentrations of GHG, choices among assumptions about the effect of increasing GHG concentrations upon the climate system, that is, the “sensitivity” of the climate system and thus the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic influences upon climate phenomena, and deeply problematic assumptions about the effects of aerosol emissions on cloud formation, about which little is known.6 That list is very far from exhaustive. Let us note that the mainstream climate models have found it very difficult to predict the historical and current climate record; as an example, the models have been unable to explain the warming observed from 1910-1945.7 That period of warming cannot have been the result of increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG, in that such concentrations had increased only from about 278 ppm in 1750 to about 300 ppm by 1910, and 310 ppm by 1945.8 Another example: Every climate model predicts that increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHG should result in an enhanced heating effect in the mid- and upper troposphere over the tropics. The satellites have been unable to find that effect, or in some analyses an effect close in magnitude to that predicted by the models.9 In the latest iteration of the suite of climate models, to be applied in the next IPCC 5 See, e.g., Figure 2.5 in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2013), on alternative paths for future temperature changes, at https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/synthesis-report/. On the wide range of temperature projections yielded by the mainstream climate models, see Figure 2 in the testimony of John R. Christy before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, March 29, 2017, at https://science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Christy%20Testimony_1.pdf?1. On the general state of scientific uncertainty in the context of climate phenomena, see e.g., Judith Curry, “Uncertainty About the Climate Uncertainty Monster,” Climate Etc., May 19, 2017, at https://judithcurry.com/2017/05/19/uncertainty-about-the-climate- uncertainty-monster/. 6 See, e.g., Judith Curry, “The Cloud-Climate Conundrum,” Climate Etc., June 2, 2016, at https://judithcurry.com/2016/06/02/the-cloud-climate-conundrum/. 7 See the HadCRUT5 reconstructions of temperature anomalies at https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/. Interestingly enough, the Russian climate models from the Institute for Numerical Mathematics (models INM-CM4 and INM-CM4.8) do the best job of predicting the past and the present. See http://www.glisaclimate.org/node/2220 and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329748540_Simulation_of_the_modern_climate_using_the_INM- CM48_climate_model. 8 See the NOAA reconstruction of carbon dioxide emissions and concentrations for 1750-2019 at https://www.climate.gov/sites/default/files/CO2_emissions_vs_concentrations_1751-2019_lrg.gif. 9 The tropics for the most part are water, and emissions of additional GHG would warm the earth slightly, resulting in an increase in ocean evaporation. In the climate models, as the water vapor rises into the mid troposphere, it condenses, releasing heat. This seems straightforward, but efforts to demonstrate this phenomenon with satellite measurements have proven very difficult. See Ross McKitrick and John R. Christy, “Pervasive Warming Bias in
7 Assessment report, the average predicted tropospheric temperature increase for 1979-2019 is 0.40 degrees C per decade. The actual record as measured by the satellites: 0.16 degrees C per decade.10 The climate models on average have overstated the temperature record by a factor of more than two. Consider only the effect of varying assumptions about the future path of atmospheric GHG concentrations. IPCC in the latest (2013) Assessment Report uses four such alternative paths: Representative Concentrations Pathways 2.6, 4.5, 6, and 8.5.11 The following table illustrates the range of temperature effects (“anomalies”) by 2100 under the four RCPs.

Under RCP8.5, atmospheric concentrations of GHG rise at almost 12 parts per million (ppm) through 2100 as an annual average; the average for 1985-2019 was about 1.9 ppm, and the single largest increase was about 3 ppm in 2016.

8 2013 Assessment Report provides a range of estimates for the equilibrium sensitivity of the climate system, from 1.5 degrees to 4.5 degrees, with a mean of 3 degrees.13 Many of the more extreme or “alarmist” assertions of the effects of anthropogenic climate change assume RCP8.5 and a climate sensitivity of 4.5 degrees (or even higher). The numerous estimates reported in the peer-reviewed literature do not support that assumption, instead supporting an assumption of 2 degrees or even less; the range estimated from the actual data is 1.5 to 2.3 degrees C.14 Again with respect to the enormous complexities inherent in the analysis of climate phenomena and “risks”: Neither the OCC nor other government agencies nor large banks are in a position to evaluate them in ways that would yield useful information for investors or regulators. Even government agencies and international bodies wholly dedicated to such analyses find the task daunting. Instead, large banks will be driven to adopt assumptions — actually, to retain consultants who will do so — minimizing the degree to which their analyses might subject them to political attacks, adverse regulatory actions, and litigation. This is very different from an objective effort to evaluate climate phenomena and a reasonable range of prospective effects of increasing GHG concentrations, that is, climate “risks.” The combination of very great climate uncertainties and the litigation and regulatory threats will create a demand from the business sector for detailed regulations on how to structure the analysis of climate risks. Regulatory agencies are hardly better suited to conduct such analysis in an objective and neutral manner. Both large banks and government agencies will have powerful incentives to use the Environmental Protection Agency climate model, used by most federal agencies to evaluate climate trends and the effects of climate policies; precisely because it is the U.S. government model, it would be difficult to attack a financial institution for choosing it.15 For the earlier suite of climate models (CMIP-5), the EPA model provided predictions close to the average of those models under a given set of underlying assumptions, equilibrium climate sensitivity in particular. For the new suite (CMIP-6), the EPA model provides predictions cooler than the average of those models, not because the EPA model now is providing predictions more consistent with the historical evidence, but because the CMIP-6 models have incorporated a range of climate sensitivity assumptions and estimates higher on average than those in the CMIP-5 iteration. That range of climate sensitivity values in CMIP-6 also is wider than that in CMIP-5, meaning that the uncertainty of the climate models is increasing.16 Again, large banks conducting climate “risk” analysis will have powerful incentives to choose among assumptions on future emissions and atmospheric concentrations, climate sensitivity, and other crucial parameters so as to insulate themselves from political attack, adverse regulatory actions, and litigation. They thus will be led toward analytic homogeneity, yielding a 13 The equilibrium sensitivity of the climate system is the temperature increase that would result from a doubling of atmospheric concentrations of GHG, after the climate system were to “finalize” all attendant adjustments. 14 See Patrick J. Michaels and Paul C. Knappenberger, Lukewarming: The New Climate Science That Changes Everything, Washington D.C.: Cato Institute, 2016; and the recent presentation by Professor John R. Christy at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2Cd4MLUoN0. 15 This is the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC), at www.magic.org. The summary analysis presented below uses version 5.3. Version 6.0 is available, but generates predictions only on the temperature effects of various GHG concentration scenarios. 16 Private communication with Professor John R. Christy, March 14, 2021.

9 very real danger of an artificial “consensus” regardless of the actual evidence, and perhaps largely inconsistent with it. Any such consensus would be an artifact of the political pressures to which the large banks would be subjected; it would have nothing to do with “science.” If, implausibly, those conducting climate “risk” analysis were to opt to use models and/or sets of assumptions that differ in important dimensions, the ensuing predictions about future climate phenomena (“risks”) would vary substantially or hugely, yielding very large uncertainties in terms of “risk” implications. What would the OCC do under that condition, how would large banks respond, and — again — what would such decisions have to do with “science”? Those political pressures will lead large banks and government agencies not to consider the benefits of increasing atmospheric concentrations of GHG, as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and in the peer-reviewed literature. Examples are planetary greening, increased agricultural productivity, increased water use efficiency by plants, and reduced mortality from cold.17 Nor will such analysis include important dimensions of the adverse impacts of government climate policies, which as a core imperative must have the effect of increasing energy costs artificially, notwithstanding common assertions that alternative energy sources are competitive in terms of costs.18 In short, government policies that force or induce large banks to evaluate the climate “risks” confronting their operations and markets will yield confusion rather than material information. One result of such confusion would be important distortions in capital markets due to a weighting of climate “risks” above those posed by other important phenomena, whether natural or manmade. III. The Evidence on Climate Phenomena and the Effects of Climate Policies in the EPA Climate Model The available body of evidence does not support the ubiquitous assertions that a climate “crisis” is upon us or looming large. This means that the asserted climate “risks” threatening the operations safety and soundness of large banks, and the stability of the financial system as a whole, are far less obvious than often assumed. That anthropogenic climate change is “real” — that increasing GHG concentrations are having detectable effects — is incontrovertible, but that does not tell us the magnitude of the observable impacts, which must be measured empirically. Temperatures are rising, but as the Little Ice Age ended no later than 1850, it is not easy to separate natural from anthropogenic effects on 17 On the carbon dioxide “greening” effect see NOAA at https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon- dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth; and Zaichun Zhu, et. al., “Greening of the Earth and Its Drivers,” Nature Climate Change, Vol. 6 (2016), pp. 791-795, at https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3004.

10 temperatures and other climate phenomena.19 The latest research in the peer-reviewed literature suggests that mankind is responsible for about half a degree of the global temperature increase of about 1.5-1.7 degrees C of global warming observed since 1850, or perhaps two-tenths of a degree of the approximate temperature increase of 1.1 degrees C since approximately 1880.20 The “crisis” assertions are unsupported by the evidence reported in the peer-reviewed, official, or scientific literature. There is little trend in the number of “hot” days for 1895–2017; 11 of the 12 years with the highest number of such days occurred before 1960.21 NOAA has maintained since 2005 the U.S. Climate Reference Network, comprising 114 meticulously maintained temperature stations spaced more or less uniformly across the lower 48 states, 21 stations in Alaska, and two stations in Hawaii.22 They are placed to avoid heat island effects and other such distortions as much as possible; the reported data show no trend over the available 2005–20 reporting period.23 A reconstruction of global temperatures over the past one million years, using data from ice sheet formations, shows that there is nothing unusual about the current warm period.24 19 On the surface (land/ocean) temperature record, see UK Met Office, Hadley Centre/University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit, “Tim Osborn: HadCRUT4 Global Temperature Graphs,” https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/~timo/diag/tempdiag.htm.

11 Global mean sea level has been increasing at about 3.3 mm per year since satellite measurements began in 1992. The tidal-gauge data before then show annual increases of about 1.9 mm per year, but that comparison does not show an acceleration in sea-level rise because the two datasets are not comparable. The tidal gauges do not measure sea levels per se; they measure the difference between sea levels and “fixed” points on land that in reality might not be fixed due to seismic activity, tectonic shifts, land settlement, etc. Accordingly, the data are unclear as to whether there is occurring an acceleration in sea level rise; it is reasonable to hypothesize that there has been such an acceleration simply because temperatures are rising due to both natural and anthropogenic influences, as noted above, and such increases should result in more melting ice and the thermal expansion of water. But because rising temperatures are the result of both natural and anthropogenic causes, we do not know the relative contributions of those causes to any such acceleration.25 The Northern and Southern Hemisphere sea ice changes tell different stories; the arctic sea ice has been declining, while the Antarctic sea ice has been stable or growing.26 U.S. tornado activity shows either no trend or a downward trend since 1954.27 Tropical storms, hurricanes, and accumulated cyclone energy show little trend since satellite measurements began in the early 1970s.28 The number of U.S. wildfires shows no trend since 1985, and global acreage burned has 25 As a crude approximation, the data suggest that about two-thirds of such sea level increases are due to ice melt, and one-third to thermal expansion of water. See Judith Curry, “Sea Level and Climate Change,” Climate Forecast Applications Network, November 25, 2018, https://curryja.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/special-report-sea-level- rise3.pdf. Curry cites research from Xianyao Chen and colleagues, the central finding of which is that “global mean sea level rise increased from 2.2 ± 0.3 mm/year in 1993 to 3.3 ± 0.3 mm/year in 2014.” See Xianyao Chen et al., “The Increasing Rate of Global Mean Sea-Level Rise During 1993–2014,” Nature Climate Change 7 (June 26, 2017): 492–95, https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate3325.

12 declined over past decades.29 The Palmer Drought Severity index shows no trend since 1895.30 U.S. flooding over the past century is uncorrelated with increasing GHG concentrations.31 The available data do not support the ubiquitous assertions about the dire impacts of declining pH levels in the oceans.32 Global food availability and production have increased more or less monotonically over the past two decades on a per capita basis.33 The IPCC itself in the Fifth Assessment Report was deeply dubious about the various severe effects often asserted to be looming as impacts of anthropogenic warming.34 If we apply the Environmental Protection Agency climate model, under the highest IPCC climate sensitivity assumption (4.5 degrees C) reported in the AR5, net-zero U.S. GHG emissions effective immediately would yield a reduction in global temperatures of 0.173 degrees C by 2100. That effect would be barely detectable given the standard deviation (about 0.11 degrees C) of the surface temperature record.35 The entire Paris agreement: about 0.178 degrees C. Net-zero emissions by the entire Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development: 0.352 degrees C. A 50 percent reduction in Chinese GHG emissions: 0.184 degrees C. A global 75 percent reduction in GHG emissions implemented immediately and maintained strictly would reduce global temperatures in 2100 by 0.540 degrees C.36 Note that GHG emissions in 2020 fell by about 6.4 percent as a result of the COVID-19 economic downturn.37 Can anyone believe that even larger GHG reductions — and the attendant economic costs — are plausible politically? Is there a believable benefit/cost model that would justify such policies? IV.

13 anthropogenic climate change to their operations view such analyses as “material” in terms of disclosures to regulators and investors.38 Several problems are attendant upon that premise, in substantial part for the reasons discussed above. Any such projections of climate phenomena and resulting “risks” — far into the future — are very far from trivial methodologically. Which climate model(s) should banks use? Which assumptions about future emissions, about the sensitivity of the climate system, about policies to be adopted internationally, about the climate effects of those policies, ad infinitum, should large banks incorporate into those models? What confidence should be attached to the predictions made by the models? Are those banks — even very large ones — in a position to do such analysis in a credible fashion? If not, whom should they retain to do that analysis for them, and how should they evaluate the differences among the available alternative providers of such analyses? Note that the concept of “risk” by its very nature implies a range of possible outcomes delineated by a statistical distribution of likelihoods around some mean and with some standard deviation. “Uncertainty” clearly is a more accurate term than “risk” in this context, in that the mean and/or standard deviation of the relevant statistical distributions are very unlikely to be known. The reality is that a “climate risk” disclosure requirement would be deeply speculative, and the level of detail and the scientific sophistication that would be needed to satisfy such a requirement are staggering. Such “disclosures” and supporting analysis and documentation would take up thousands of pages, with references to thousands more, and the premise that this “disclosure” requirement would facilitate improved decisionmaking by bank managements and regulators is difficult to take seriously. If climate “risks” are deemed important in terms of safety, soundness, and systemic stability objectives, why not others that also are uncertain or speculative? Climate “risks” are hardly the only ones potentially relevant to financial institutions, and all are difficult to evaluate and to incorporate into capital allocation decisions. What about massive volcanic eruptions? Asteroid impacts? Powerful earthquakes? Tsunamis? The potential problem of mass contagion is one with which we are far more familiar now than was the case only somewhat more than a year ago. The use of bioweaponry by terrorists, nuclear war, gamma ray storms, and on and on. Is climate “risk” the most important? If that is the hypothesis, what is the basis for it? Why are those others, and many more, not worthy of incorporation into disclosure requirements for large banks? What distortions would result from attention only to climate change and not others? Because the perceived “climate “risks” confronting large banks are dependent upon crucial choices among alternative assumptions, the evaluation of such “risks” would be largely arbitrary given that the “correct” assumptions are very far from obvious. This means that a requirement, whether formal or informal, that climate “risks” be evaluated by large banks would weaken the overall management of risks by financial institutions. When “risk” analysis becomes an arbitrary function of choices among assumptions complex, opaque, and far from obvious, the traditional pursuit of safety and soundness inexorably will be hindered and rendered far less effective in terms of the investment and productivity objectives of the financial markets, an outcome diametrically at odds with the ostensible objectives of those advocating the evaluation of climate “risks.” 38 See a legal summary of the SEC disclosure requirements for public companies for material information at http://www.legalandcompliance.com/securities-resources/sec-requirements-for-public-companies/.
14 For these reasons, the preliminary principles published by the OCC are deeply problematic. The principles simply shunt aside the massive analytic problems inherent in the analysis of climate “risks,” instead emphasizing a general stance that market forces will not yield appropriate safety, soundness, and systemic stability outcomes attendant upon competitive market process in the absence of regulatory mandates. It is perhaps unsurprising that regulators view market incentives as insufficient to engender an efficient outcome in terms of resource allocation, and that a regulatory strengthening of such incentives automatically would yield an allocational improvement. That stance is very far from obviously correct. V. Conclusions The available analysis suggests that the prospective risks to financial institutions attendant upon anthropogenic climate change, at least in the aggregate, are much smaller than many assert. Consider the predictions from the integrated assessment models, the central one of which is the Dynamic Integrated Climate and Economy Model, for which William D. Nordhaus won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2018.39 Under DICE, global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2100 varies by about 3 percent across policy scenarios, including no climate policies at all, a figure that is both very small and almost certainly not statistically significant given the vagaries of economic forecasting and the number of years remaining before the end of this century. (I exclude here Nordhaus’ “Stern discounting” policy scenario, as it assumes a discount rate effectively equal to zero, a fundamental analytic error.40) Per capita consumption varies only by about 1.3 percent across policy scenarios, also a very small number and almost certain not to be statistically significant. The IPCC — even in its most alarmist analyses — arrives at a conclusion very close to that reported in the DICE analysis. In its latest report, it finds that the damage from anthropogenic climate change unmitigated by policy initiatives will reduce global GDP by 2.6 percent by 2100.41 By that year, IPCC projects that individual incomes on average will be at least 400 percent greater than is the case today.42 39 See William Nordhaus and Paul Sztorc, “DICE 2013R: Introduction and User’s Manual,” Yale University, Department of Economics, October 2013, Figure 4 and Table 1, http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/homepage/documents/DICE_Manual_100413r1.pdf.

15 A mandate from the OCC that large banks evaluate climate “risks” is likely to distort the allocation of capital away from economic sectors disfavored by certain political interest groups pursuing ideological agendas. This would represent the return of Operation Choke Point, an attempt to politicize access to credit, one far broader than was applicable only to financial institutions, and deeply corrosive of our legal and constitutional institutions. Protection of those institutions is consistent only with formal policymaking by the Congress through enactment of legislation, rather than with pressures exerted by the OCC and other regulatory agencies.","The comment by Benjamin Zycher from the American Enterprise Institute criticizes the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) proposal for large banks to evaluate climate-related financial risks. Zycher argues that estimating climate risks is futile due to the vast scientific uncertainties and the arbitrary nature of assumptions required for such evaluations. He suggests that these assessments would be politicized and driven by regulatory and litigation threats rather than scientific evidence. Zycher contends that the focus on climate risks could lead to a misallocation of capital and weaken the financial system's stability. He also questions the validity of the climate crisis narrative, citing evidence that suggests the impacts of anthropogenic climate change are smaller than often claimed. Zycher advocates for allowing market forces to determine risk assessments rather than imposing regulatory mandates, which he believes could distort capital allocation and undermine economic stability. He concludes that the OCC should abandon its climate risk evaluation efforts and focus on its traditional roles of ensuring safety and soundness in the financial system."
kzk-4rsn-k90q,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. 
I am a retired science teacher. I spent thirty one years teaching Biology, Environmental Earth Science and Wildlife Management classes in the public school systems of three states. My education was first as a Biologist, teaching came later. I have a Master of Science degree in Biology. As a biologist I am concerned with the effects our large human population is having on the sustainability of our Earth's life support systems. Although there are some impressive natural systems that help to stabilize the living environment on our planet, there are limits to how much abuse these systems can withstand. The fossil records show that in the past there have been several major disruptions of these systems. Today the biggest threat to our spaceship Earth comes from the activities of us humans. Our continued population growth combined with the crazy notion that there must always be an expanding economy is a sure-fired prescription for disaster. Misguided economic policies are in direct conflict with the natural limits of Earth. Our finite planet can not provide unlimited resources to allow us to continue on the path we are on.
We must make decisions based on sound ecological principles if we are to bequeath our children and grandchildren with a place to live that is both sustainable and interesting. It will be a tragedy of monstrous proportions if our shortsighted way of making decisions degrades the world that our children inherit. The wonderful diversity of living creatures and wild unspoiled natural places must be preserved for them. It seems that we are unaware that the wild natural places are the ultimate infrastructure of the planet. The natural ecosystems stabilize the atmospheric gasses and maintain our freshwater systems. Our present economic systems of continued growth are nothing more than a Ponzi scheme in which our descendants will be left with nothing of value.
I am writing today to request that you help address one of the issues that will affect future generations, including our two sons and our wonderful twelve year old granddaughter and her four year old little sister. Our other son and wife have a three year old son and a one year old daughter. Please try to throw off the short term considerations and take action that will address the long term welfare of humankind. The welfare of all of our children depends on us.      
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 
And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The commenter, a retired science teacher with a background in biology, expresses concern about the impact of human activities on Earth's ecosystems and the sustainability of life-support systems. They argue that economic policies focused on continuous growth conflict with Earth's finite resources, likening them to a Ponzi scheme. The commenter urges Comptroller Hsu to prioritize long-term ecological principles over short-term economic gains to ensure a sustainable future for future generations. They criticize banks for investing in fossil fuels despite public commitments to address climate change, highlighting the risks to financial systems and vulnerable communities.

Subject: Use the full extent of your authority to curtail banks’ investments in climate change -- Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Document ID: OCC-2021-0023-0001)
To Comptroller Hsu:
Thank you for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. The public supports the new guidance telling big banks to mitigate climate risks.
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and announce new climate plans in which they will phase out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are directly fueling the climate crisis—a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance's recommendations to banks that they:
1. incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
2. plan for climate change over a long-time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
3. develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; and
4. make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must ensure that banks' actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks' management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk, and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.

kzl-qffg-p6yw,"February 13, 2022 Grovetta N. Gardineer Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy Attention: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219. Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks [Docket ID OCC-2021-0023] Dear Ms. Gardineer: I am pleased to provide these comments in response to the release by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) of proposed “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.”1 General Comments The OCC mission statement reads: To ensure that national banks and federal savings associations operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair access to financial services, treat customers fairly, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.2 There is nothing in the mission statement about climate change, curing cancer or a hundred other worthy objectives. “Climate-related” financial risks are only relevant to the OCC’s actual mission if they are material to the safety and soundness of supervised banks. As a factual matter, climate-related risks are generally not material to the safety and soundness of banks. Constant repetition by regulators and politicians that they are does not make it so. But to the extent climate-related financial risks are actually financially material and determinable, current laws and regulations require that those risks be addressed. There is no need for additional rules. Indeed, virtually the entire “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks” document reads as if Part 30 of Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the Comptroller’s Handbook risk management sections3 were summarized and then the words 1 “Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback,” OCC Bulletin 2021-62, December 16, 2021 https://www.occ.gov/news- issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html and “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks” https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62a.pdf. 2 Our Mission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency https://www.occ.treas.gov/about/index-about.html. 3 See, for example, Comptroller's Handbook: Corporate and Risk Governance, Comptroller's Handbook: Country Risk Management, Comptroller's Handbook: Interest Rate Risk, Comptroller's Handbook: Model Risk Management,
“climate-related financial” were inserted in front of the word “risk” wherever it occurred. There is no legitimate reason to single out climate-related risks for special treatment as compared to the hundreds of other types of material risk – risks that are usually more important than those attributable to climate change. Were the OCC to stay in its lane and only addresses climate- related financial risks that are actually material and determinable under current bank supervision principles, then such an approach is legitimate. There is good reason to believe, however, that is not what is really going to happen. The OCC should not submit to political demands from the White House to weaponize financial regulation in furtherance of progressive political objectives.4 Politicizing the OCC will seriously damage its reputation. Moreover, attempting to further progressive political and social objectives unrelated to the OCC’s actual mission will make any such regulation economically suspect and may well result in a court holding that the OCC does not have the statutory authority to promulgate the regulation. OCC attempts to circumvent the Administrative Procedure Act by the use of guidance documents and examinations and enforcement actions based on guidance documents will be similarly suspect. They may well be successfully challenged as unlawful when subjected to judicial review.5 Before this guidance document becomes the basis for any enforcement action or any bank examination, the OCC needs to do the hard work of writing an Administrative Procedure Act compliant rule providing notice and seeking public comment. If it does so, the points made in the sections below regarding the complexity and deep ambiguity involved in undertaking the “climate-related” risk assessment enterprise will become quite evident. OCC also needs to seek OIRA clearance and, further, comply with Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, Executive Order No. 12866 and related executive orders. It should not seek to evade the APA and other regulatory requirements by issuing guidance documents that are really rules and then moving immediately to enforcement of the rule masquerading as guidance by means of the bank supervision process. Problems with OCC Regulation of “Climate-Related Financial Risk” 1. Additional Climate Change Risk Assessment Requirements Would Impede the OCC’s Important Mission. The important mission of the OCC is to ensure the safety and soundness of banks, provide fair access to financial services, and ensure that customers are treated fairly. Requirements relating to climate-related financial risk beyond those required under existing rules Comptroller's Handbook: Rating Credit Risk, Comptroller's Handbook: Risk Management of Financial Derivatives, available at https://www.ots.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/index- comptrollers-handbook.html or 12 CFR Part 30, Appendix A to Part 30 - Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness, II. Operational and Managerial Standards, A.2. Effective risk assessment https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-I/part-30 . 4 See especially, “Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” section 3, May 20, 2021 https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related- financial-risk/. The Executive Order like the “Principles” document is almost entirely unsullied by citations to facts. 5 See, for example, the Memorandum Ruling in State of Louisiana et al. v. Biden (United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, February 11, 2022) granting a preliminary injunction against Executive Order 13990 (another climate change motivated initiative) available at https://aboutblaw.com/1FH or via PACER.
related to material risks would impede rather than further that mission. Such requirements would affirmatively harm depositors, customers, bank shareholders, taxpayers, and the economy by distracting the OCC from its actual mission. 2. Requiring Banks to Devote Resources and Inappropriately Weight Immaterial Climate Change “Risk” Will Increase Rather than Decrease Risk. Requiring banks to inappropriately weight climate-related financial risks that are not actually material and to devote resources to risks that are not actually material or determinable will reduce the focus on and weight given to risks that actually are material. Banks are likely to distort their risk assessments to satisfy a politicized OCC. To the extent that banks begin focusing on immaterial or lesser “climate-related” risks out of concern for satisfying politicized regulators, instead of focusing on real, material risks, the risks borne by the financial system will increase, not decrease. 3. Climate Models and Climate Science are Highly Uncertain. There is a massive amount of variance among various climate models and uncertainty regarding the future of the climate. I am no climate science expert. Nor, I suspect, is anyone at the OCC since climate science is way outside of the OCC’s lane. I do know a thing or two about modeling in an economics context. Models are typically highly dependent on a few relationships specified in their equations and parameters. A small number of assumptions about relationships and parameters drive results. For example, a model examining the impact of proposed tax policy might adopt a neoclassical view where the impact of the proposed tax changes on the user cost of capital and labor response are central (as specified in the equations) and the empirical parameters (as specified in the elasticities) governing investment and labor are key.6 Seemingly small adjustments to elasticities (even though within the bounds established in the empirical literature) result is significantly different results. A Keynesian “macroeconomic” approach focusing on aggregate demand would yield dramatically different results, operate on different principles and lead to different policy recommendations. And so on. Climate modeling is, in principle, no different. A small number of equations and empirical parameters drive results. Even the conventional governmental source -- the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – shows massive variations in projections and shows the wide divergence in the ability of models to account for past warming7 and the degree of warming that is anthropogenic.8 The worst-case concentration pathway, for example, assumes unlikely 6 Parker Sheppard and David Burton, “How the GOP Tax Bill Will Affect the Economy,” Daily Signal, November 17, 2017 https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/11/17/gop-tax-bill-will-affect-economy/. In this case, we used the Hall- Jorgenson user cost of capital equation, the Cobb-Douglas production function and conventional price theoretic labor market modeling. 7 See, for instance, Byron A. Steinman, Michael E. Mann and Sonya K. Miller, “Atlantic and Pacific Multidecadal Oscillations and Northern Hemisphere Temperatures,” Science, February 27, 2015, Vol. 347, Issue 6225, pp 988- 991, https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6225/988#aff-1 and Joseph Majkut, “Climbing the Staircase of Global Warming,” Niskanen Center, July 27, 2016, https://www.niskanencenter.org/climbing-staircase-global- warming/ . 8 Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full.pdf See, for example, “The Representative Concentration Pathways,” (p. 57); “Box 2.3, Models and Methods for Estimating Climate Change Risks, Vulnerability and Impacts,” (pp. 58-59); “Table 2.1, Projected Change in Global Mean Surface Temperature and Global Mean Sea Level Rise for the Mid- and Late 21st Century, Relative to the 1986–2005 Period,” (p. 60);
projections of coal use, high population growth, low economic growth and technological progress.9 Using the worst-case scenario of these emissions concentration pathways as the business-as-usual scenario will mislead the private sector, policymakers, and regulators on the estimated climate impacts and costs.10 Once you broaden your reading to include those that do not have a financial or political interest in climate change alarmism, it becomes clear that the variance and uncertainty in climate modeling is even higher than the IPCC report indicates.11 It is clear that various models yield dramatically different results. Explaining the details of these dramatic differences in model outcomes is beyond the scope of this letter and my current competence. It is also beyond the ability of the OCC and its bank examiners. 4. Economic Modeling of Climate Change Effects is Even More Uncertain. There is an even higher degree of variance and uncertainty associated with attempts to model or project the economic impact of highly divergent and uncertain climate models. Any estimate of the economic impact of climate change would have to rely on highly uncertain and divergent climate model results discussed in section 3 (above). In addition to this high degree of uncertainty would be added an entirely new family of economic ambiguity and uncertainty. At the outset, any economic estimate of the impact of climate change would also have to choose a discount rate to arrive at the present discounted value of future costs and benefits of climate change and to estimate the future costs and benefits of various regulatory or private responses. The choice of discount rate is controversial and important. Estimates would need to be made of the cost of various aspects of climate change (sea level rises, the impact on agriculture, etc.). Estimates would need to be made of the cost of various remediation techniques. Guesses would need to be made about the rate of technological change. Guesses would need to be made about the regulatory, tax and other responses of a myriad of governments. Estimates would need to be made using conventional economic techniques regarding the economic impact of those changes which, in turn, would reflect a wide variety of techniques and in many cases a thin or non-existent empirical literature. Guesses would need to “Cumulative Total Anthropogenic CO2 Emissions from 1870 (GtCO2),” (p. 63); “Table 2.2, “Cumulative Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emission Consistent with Limiting Warming to Less than Stated Temperature Limits at Different Levels of Probability, Based on Different Lines of Evidence,” (p. 64).

be made of market responses to all of these changes since market participants will not stand idly by and do nothing as markets and the regulatory environment change. Then, after making decisions regarding all of these extraordinarily complex, ambiguous and uncertain issues, banks would then need to assess the likely impact of climate change on their specific business years into the future – a business that may by then bear little resemblance to the issuers’ existing business and a business that will adjust its choices based on future developments rather than blithely continuing to do what it is doing today. 5. The OCC Does Not Possess the Expertise to Competently Assess Climate Models or the Economic Impact of Climate Change. The OCC has neither the expertise to assess climate models nor the expertise to assess economic models purporting to project the economic impact of divergent and uncertain climate projections. To even begin to have such a capability, OCC will have to build out a climate change department of twenty to forty climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, biologists, economists and so forth and then train their approximately 666 large bank examiners on these various issues at a very sophisticated level. Any estimate of the economic impact of climate change will have to rely on the highly uncertain and divergent climate and economic model results discussed in sections 3 and 4 (above). Then, OCC examiners would need to assess the accuracy of the banks’ “risk assessments” based on this speculative house of cards. The idea that all of this can be done in a way that will meaningfully improve the regulation of the safety and soundness of banks is not credible. People, including banks, bank examiners, investors and customers, are going to disagree about the future because the future is highly uncertain. To deny this evident fact is folly. 6. The OCC Has Neither the Expertise nor the Administrative Ability to Assess the Accuracy of Banks-Specific Climate Change Risk Assessments. The OCC does not have the expertise or administrative ability to assess the accuracy, or lack thereof, of banks’ “climate change risk assessments” based on bank-specific speculation regarding the impact of climate change which would be based on bank-specific choices regarding highly divergent and uncertain economic models projecting the economic impact of climate changes based on bank-specific choices regarding highly divergent and uncertain climate models. 7. OCC Resources Are Better Spent Furthering Its Mission. Imposing these requirements and developing the expertise to police such climate change risk assessment by roughly 1,100 regulated entities will involve the expenditure of very substantial resources. These resources would be much better spent furthering the OCC’s important mission. There are approximately 2380 OCC bank examiners, 28 percent (about 666) of whom are assigned to large banks.12 The “Principles” document, by its terms, only applies to roughly 33 banks (i.e. those with assets over $100 billion). If that remains the case, then the administrative burden, while significant and wasteful, will be manageable. OCC will have to build out a climate change department of twenty to forty climatologists, meteorologists, geologists, biologists, 12 OCC Annual Report, 2021, Figure 1, p. 2 https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and- resources/publications/annual-report/files/2021-annual-report.html.
economists and so forth and then train their 666 large bank examiners on these various issues. This amounts to about a three to six percent increase in the non-examiner OCC staff.13 It is likely, however, that this is just a trial run – a pilot program if you will – and that the rules will eventually be applied using a more conventional large bank definition of $10 billion in assets. Then, it will apply to roughly 150 banks.14 Assuming (heroically) that a bank examiner could competently evaluate the climate modeling choices, economic modeling choices and bank specific determinations of one bank every month, that would still mean that OCC would need at least an additional 13 employees. It probably would take more like three months and therefore about 40 additional employees. Were the requirement applied to all 1,118 supervised institutions, the corresponding employee requirements would be 93 (one month) and 280 employees (three months) devoted to this aspect of supervision (a 4 to 12 percent increase in the number of examiners). These requirements are in addition to the estimated 20 to 40 personnel needed to staff out a new climate change department. This department will be necessary to create even a modicum of climate-related expertise within the OCC related to climate modeling, the associated economic modeling and training of bank examiners. 8. The Costs Imposed on Regulated Entities Would be Large. Requiring even just large banks to develop climate modeling expertise, the ability to make macroeconomic projections based on these models and then make firm-specific economic assessments based on these climate and economic models will be expensive, imposing costs that will amount to hundreds of millions and potentially billions of dollars. These expenses must be recovered by the banks one way or another. These costs would harm investors by reducing shareholder returns or customers by increasing costs (to borrowers) or reducing returns to depositors or other lenders. Costs incurred by private institutions relating to ESG requirements in capital markets generally are already running to the many billions of dollars.15 9. Climate Change Risk Assessment Requirements Would Create a New Compliance Eco- System and a New Lobby to Retain the Requirements. The imposition of such requirements would result in the creation of a new compliance eco-system and pro-complexity lobby composed of the economists, accountants, attorneys and compliance officers that live off of the revised banking regulations. This is already starting to happen.16 10. Banking Laws are a Poor Mechanism to Address Externalities. Externalities, such as pollution, should be addressed by either enhancing property rights or, in the case of unowned resources such as the air and waterways, by a regulatory response that carefully assesses the costs and benefits of the regulatory response. Banking safety and soundness regulation is the 13 3,551 -2880 = 671. 20/671 = 0.03. 20/671 = 0.06.

wrong place to try to address externalities. Policing externalities is far outside of the scope of OCC’s mission and the purpose of the banking laws. The economic justification for climate change mandates is that they are designed to address a negative externality. An externality is (1) a cost that is imposed on (negative externality) or (2) a benefit accorded to (positive externality) someone that is not a party to a transaction or not engaged in an action. There are countless positive and negative externalities all around us. Air pollution is a typical example of a negative externality. There are many ways to address negative externalities. Improved property rights,17 tort law,18 regulation,19 or a tax equal to the cost involuntarily imposed by the economic actor creating the externality on those “external” to the transaction.20 A tax subsidy for politically favored interests with strong lobbies would be fairly far down the list of efficacious means of addressing the problem of negative externalities but there are many provisions in the Internal Revenue Code with this purpose. To achieve the desired effect, the policy designed to address the externality must be calibrated to accurately internalize the actual cost of the externality. This requires estimating the costs imposed by the externality and imposing costs in an equal and off-setting amount on the economic actor in question. Detailed scientific, cost and market information must be obtained to get this even close to right. Trying to achieve this result through risk assessments by banks is comparable to trying to score in basketball by bouncing the ball off the floor and then the backboard. It is theoretically possible, but there is a vanishingly small chance that it will achieve the desired result. And any team that tried that on a regular basis would lose. Similarly, banking laws are not the place to do environmental regulation. It is clear that mandated climate-related risk assessments will have significant costs and adverse effects. Proponents of such risk assessments should be required to explain how, exactly, it will have a meaningful positive impact AND why banking regulation is a more efficacious means of addressing the problem than traditional means of addressing environmental problems, some of which have been highly successful. I suggest that they will not be able to do so. 11. Climate Change Risk Assessment Requirements Would Have No Meaningful Impact on the Climate. When all is said and done, climate change risk assessment requirements will have somewhere between a trivial impact and no impact on climate change. 17 In the case of air and water that are usually unowned resources, this is problematic. In other cases, this can be the solution, although transactions costs can impede a private solution.

12. Efforts to Redefine Materiality or the Broader Purpose of Business should be Opposed. There is a major push to redefine what is deemed material for securities regulation purposes. This “Principles” document is the beginning of a similar push with respect to determining what is material risk in banking regulation. Simply because some politically motivated investors seek to impose a disclosure requirement on issuers, for example, does not make such a requirement material. The effort to redefine materiality in the securities laws (and now banking) is part of an increasingly strident effort to redefine the purpose of businesses more generally to achieve various social or political objectives unrelated to earning a return, satisfying customers, or treating workers or suppliers fairly. This is being done under the banner of social justice; corporate social responsibility (CSR); stakeholder theory; environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria; socially responsible investing (SRI); sustainability; diversity; business ethics; common-good capitalism; or corporate actual responsibility. The social costs of ESG and broader efforts to repurpose business firms will be considerable. Wages will decline or grow more slowly, firms will be less productive and less internationally competitive, investor returns will decline, innovation will slow, goods and services quality will decline and their prices will increase. Banking regulation risk assessments should be limited to those risks that impose a substantial, material financial risk for banks. Period. Full stop. While climate-related risks can fall into that category, they rarely do. And, more importantly, to the extent that they do, no additional regulation is required. The current rules would cover material risks associated with climate change. The Social Costs of ESG The broader social costs associated with ESG requirements can, in principle, be quantified. This section provides an analytical framework that may be useful in analyzing the social welfare costs of ESG requirements. To the extent ESG objectives are not pursued by businesses for the purpose of making a profit, R > R , where R is the rate of return on investment in the absence of ESG, CSR, sustainability ESG/CSR requirements, diversity requirements, or stakeholder theory implementation, and R is the ESG/CSR rate of return after implementation of those requirements. The difference, R - R , is ESG/CSR economically analogous to a tax. It is a reduction in return due to the pursuit of ESG objectives. Thus, R - R = Tax . This means that various techniques used in public finance to ESG/CSR ESG/CSR analyze the social welfare impact of taxes may be used to quantitatively analyze the social welfare cost of these provisions (i.e., Tax ). ESG/CSR A tax has an excess burden or deadweight loss that can be calculated.21 By introducing a wedge (Tax ) between, in this case, the gross return and the net return, ESG/CSR reduces the size ESG/CSR 21Arnold C. Harberger, “The Incidence of the Corporation Income Tax,” Journal of Political Economy (June 1962), pp. 215–240; Alan J. Auerbach and James R. Hines, “Taxation and Economic Efficiency,” in Martin Feldstein and A. J. Auerbach, eds., Handbook of Public Economics (Amsterdam: North Holland, 2002); and John Creedy, “The Excess Burden of Taxation and Why It (Approximately) Quadruples When the Tax Rate Doubles,” New Zealand Treasury Working Paper No. 03/29, December 2003, https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2007-10/twp03-
of the capital market and therefore output and employment. In a well-functioning market, the price of a capital asset should be equal to the present value of the expected future income stream generated by the asset net of taxes and depreciation.22 Introducing a new tax (in this case Tax ) would reduce the expected future income stream, and therefore, the price of the asset. ESG/CSR It would also cause investment to flow out of the affected sector or jurisdiction. Who bears the actual economic burden of the corporate income tax is an open question.23 The analysis of who bears the burden of Tax would be the same. One thing is certain: It cannot ESG/CSR be corporations. A corporation is a legal fiction, and legal fictions do not pay taxes—people pay taxes. The corporate tax could be borne by corporate shareholders in the form of lower returns;24 owners of all capital (again in the form of lower returns);25 corporate customers in the form of higher prices;26 or employees (in the form of lower wages).27 It is, almost certainly, some 29.pdf. See also, for example, N. Gregory Mankiw, Principles of Economics, 4th ed. (Boston: Cengage Learning, 2006), chapter 8 (or many other textbooks on price theory, microeconomics, or principles of economics). 22See Robert E. Hall and Dale Jorgenson, “Tax Policy and Investment Behavior,” American Economic Review, Vol. 57, No. 3 (June 1967), pp. 391–414.

For a more detailed explanation, see Arnold C. Harberger, “The Incidence of the Corporation Income Tax,” Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 70, No. 3 (June 1962), pp. 215–240. 26The focus of the economics profession to date has been almost exclusively the impact on capital and labor rather than customers. 27Arnold C.

combination of these.28 The economics profession has changed its thinking on this issue several times over the past four decades, but the latest —and highly plausible —consensus is that workers probably bear more than half of the burden of the corporate income tax because capital is highly mobile.29 Labor’s share of the corporate tax burden is potentially as high as three-quarters.30 Shareholders (investors) probably bear most of the remainder.31 Initially (i.e., in the short run), the impact on shareholder returns would be greater. Adjustments take time. In the long run, ESG requirements (Tax ) would have a disproportionately negative impact on labor due to capital ESG/CSR factor mobility. Selected Responses to Specific Requests for Feedback 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? As discussed above, OCC should not attempt to evade the APA and other rule-making requirements by issuing guidance documents that are really rules and then moving to imposing this guidance via bank examination and enforcement actions. Actually drafting a rule would impose some humility on OCC since drafting a rule would force OCC to engage with the immense complexity of such an enterprise. Furthermore, evading the APA and other requirements will make such guidance subject to successful challenges in court. 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? See discussion above. The challenges are immense since the climate modeling, economics modeling and bank specific predictions necessary are highly indeterminate and necessitate an entire series of guesses with respect to future developments. It is a speculative house of cards. 28It requires extreme, implausible assumptions about elasticities of demand for, or supply of, factors for this not to be the case. Alan J.

6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? In principle, future risks should be discounted by a discount rate. Depending on the discount rate chosen, at some point the present discounted magnitude of future risks becomes so small as to be immaterial. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? Banks that are involved in underwriting or otherwise marketing green bonds or other ESG products should be required to fully disclose their conflicts of interest to customers and clients. 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate- related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? See discussion above. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? The current regulatory reporting requirements are sufficient. Sincerely, David R. Burton Senior Fellow in Economic Policy The Heritage Foundation 214 Massachusetts Avenue, NE Washington, DC 20002 202-608-6229 (direct dial) David.Burton@heritage.org","The comment, submitted by David R. Burton from The Heritage Foundation, critiques the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) proposed principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. Burton argues that climate-related risks are not materially relevant to the safety and soundness of banks, which is the OCC's primary mission. He contends that existing regulations already cover material risks, including those related to climate change, and additional rules are unnecessary. Burton expresses concern that the OCC's focus on climate risks is politically motivated and could damage its reputation. He highlights the uncertainty in climate and economic modeling, suggesting that the OCC lacks the expertise to assess these risks accurately. Burton warns that imposing climate risk assessments could divert resources from the OCC's core mission, increase costs for banks, and create a compliance burden without meaningful impact on climate change. He also criticizes the broader push to redefine materiality and the purpose of businesses to include social and political objectives, arguing that this could have negative economic consequences."
kzl-qnbz-b9vc,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. I am very concerned about the climate crisis for myself, my son, and my grandchildren. We have been talking about this for years. Now we must do something. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks’ continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: 1. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; 3. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 4. And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The commenter expresses gratitude to Comptroller Hsu for addressing climate change in relation to banks, highlighting personal concern for future generations. They criticize banks for claiming to address climate change while investing heavily in fossil fuels, which exacerbates the crisis and endangers the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. The commenter urges regulators to prevent banks from making short-term decisions that threaten the economy and communities. They support proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management, plan for long-term climate impacts, define risk exposures, and align internal strategies with public climate commitments. The commenter emphasizes the need for banks to match their actions with their net-zero carbon commitments and suggests that climate risk management should influence supervisory ratings. They call for the OCC to issue strong guidance, protect against unsafe banking practices, and enforce remedies where necessary."
kzm-ba97-e5tn,"Big banks are pouring billions of financing for the fossil fuel industry, even as climate change accelerates and  extreme weather events attributable to climate change wreak hundreds of billions in damages annually. The link between banks' fossil fuel financing and economic damage suffered by individuals and communities, is irrefutable.   Financial regulators have a responsibility to counter the moral hazards that motivate banks to seek short-term gains from enabling projects that create present and future harms to the general public.  
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:

The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
OCC should do more than formulate principles for climate-related risk management.

When you step back and take a look at almost all the health and other problems we have had in the 20th Century, they are the result of burning fossil fuels.  For a long time we did not understand that was warming the entire planet.   Now we do know it.   We must stop using fossil fuels IMMEDIATELY.
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;

kzm-suvl-xyds,"Finance Watch Feedback on OCC Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Introduction Opening Comment Finance Watch welcomes the OCC work on the principles for climate-related financial risk management, which recognizes the challenges faced by banks and supervisors alike in this area. However, our feedback outlines that principles-based guidance for supervisors and financial institutions will not be sufficient to achieve timely and impactful outcomes in managing climate-related financial risks of the banking sector. In addition to these, further measures are needed based on a precautionary approach in tackling these risks, which can and should be done as part of the holistic review of bank prudential regulation. Detailed points on addressing climate-related financial risks can be found in our recent report “A silver bullet against green swans”.1 Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? Climate-related financial risks are systemic in nature and this is consistent with the perspective of focusing on large banks. An important consideration from the systemic perspective is the fact that continued financing of climate change accelerating activities leads to the situation where banks will no longer be able to mitigate their risk due to irreversible changes of the climate. However, the principles should ultimately apply broadly to all banks, particularly given the financial implications of climate change for all bank's financial positions. There are still significant implications from banks of smaller sizes on customers and for the economy if they are not properly managing climate-related financial risks. Furthermore, whilst smaller banks may not pose the same systemic level of risk on their own, the kinds of impacts from climate-related financial risks will be materializing at similar times for all banks and this could make a collective of smaller banks very systemically significant in this context. Given the global nature of climate change, its impact and the interconnectedness of financial markets, international coordination on minimum regulatory and supervisory requirements is both justified and needed. 1Symon, Julia,A silver bullet against green swans: Incorporating climate-related financial risk into bank and insurance prudential rules, November 2021. 1
Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? First and foremost regulatory action is needed to ensure that climate-related financial risks are properly managed. This means taking a holistic regulatory perspective, covering all of the prudential ‘pillars’. As part of these regulatory upgrades supervisors can be specifically mandated to investigate whether proportionality on the grounds of size, complexity, or scope of operations could be justified. An underlying principle for the assessment of proportionality must be to ensure that risk is still properly managed and not to create a deregulatory agenda that transfers risk to clients or citizens to reduce administrative burden. General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Climate-related financial risks have specific features, which pose significant challenges when it comes to deploying existing prudential tools and approaches to tackle them.2 Specifically: - Disruption risk: Climate-related events are defined as “green swans” and have specific features, which makes them impossible to predict and model. In particular, green swans are characterized by: i) certainty of their occurrence despite highly uncertain impacts and the impossibility to determine the exact timing of their materialization; ii) wide-ranging and existential impacts on the economy and the financial system; iii) a high degree of complexity, including cascade effects and chain reactions in the environment, economy and society. - Probabilities of climate-related events not reflected in past data: Traditional risk modeling based on historical data is not possible as we are dealing with a forward-looking phenomenon, for which no past data can be used reliably to extrapolate the future. By definition, when the data eventually arrives, it will be too late to avert a global climate change-induced financial crisis. - Growing risk with prolonged inaction: The magnitude and probability of climate change materialization are increasing as long as no tangible actions are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Once global temperatures have exceeded their 2BIS, BdF – P. Bolton, M. Despres, L.A. Pereira da Silva, F. Samama, R.

A Call for Action - Climate Change as a Source of Financial Risk, April 2019. 2
pre-industrial level by 2°C, the consequences on human society and the global economy will be irreversible and largely unpredictable.3 - The time horizon of climate-related financial risks materialization can be significantly longer than the horizon of the current business forecasting, planning and risk management frameworks. This poses additional challenges for financial institutions to appropriately incorporate climate-related financial risks into management practices.4 - Environmental stability, including climate, is by nature a public good, which comes at no cost to private agents. Coupled with the long materialization horizons of climate-related financial risks, this means that businesses and financial institutions do not have incentives to consider the implications of their activities for the environment/climate. Looking after public good is the mission of governments/regulators, not private agents. Due to these specific features of climate-related financial risks, no credible methodologies or tools have been developed yet to accurately identify and assess or measure these risks. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published two reports in April 2021 outlining numerous challenges and conceptual issues related to climate risk measurement and methodologies. The most notable of these include the specific features of climate-related financial risks (as was mentioned in Section 2 above), data gaps5, difficulties to translate climate-related events into financial impacts on institutions’ portfolios (climate risk drivers and transmission channels).6 Current Risk Management Practices 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? At this point in time climate-related financial risks are not being successfully managed. As credit ratings for fossil fuel assets do not take into account transition, physical or disruption risk there is an effective risk subsidy in place. Capital requirements cannot be properly calibrated to cover the risk in this case, unless specific updates to existing prudential rules are introduced. Until this underlying issue is dealt with, other measures unfortunately are closer to window-dressing than risk management. This conclusion is supported by the results of the European Central Bank (ECB) assessment of the banks’ current progress on Pillar II measures, whereby the ECB has concluded that banks’ 3Climate scientists have introduced a notion of the tipping points in the climate developments, which represent thresholds in temperature rise, which cannot be reversed and which can lead to large changes in the state of the system. 4Mark Carney “Breaking the tragedy of the horizon – climate change and financial stability” speech, September 2015 5Also extensively investigated by NGFS,Progress reporton bridging data gaps, May 2021. 6BIS,Climate-related financial risks – measurementmethodologies;Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels, April 2021. 3
current practices fall short of supervisory expectations7. Banks were found to be “not yet in a position to identify, manage and monitor [climate and environmental] risks at counterparty level”. Also the banks’ plans to set a framework for climate management do not yet ensure that most banks can properly manage these risks8. The study by BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory on “Development of tools and mechanisms for the integration of ESG factors into the EU banking prudential framework and into banks' business strategies and investment policies” also concluded that “integration of ESG within banks’ risk management and investment practices, as well as prudential supervision, is at an early stage” and “needs to be accelerated”.9 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? Operationalisation of the traditional guidance on materiality assessment represents a major issue in the case of climate-related financial risks, as there is significant level of uncertainty associated with climate-related risks, insufficient availability, as well as standardization and consistency of data with which to analyze and measure these risks. Transmission channels between climate events and financial implications for the balance sheets of affected institutions require further exploration before these are fully understood. Further, the fact that the OCC considers only financial materiality is a significant gap in its approach to the interaction between climate change and banking institutions. Financial materiality is of course essential, but when it comes to climate change financial materiality is fed by environmental materiality. In other words, attempting to address financial materiality without addressing environmental materiality is tantamount to deciding to ignore the root causes of climate-related financial risks. A doom loop exists by which financial institutions, and in particular banking institutions, make climate change possible by providing financing to the fossil fuel industry, which is at the source of the bulk of CO2 emissions. At the same time, banking institutions are themselves threatened by climate change. The lack of consideration of the double materiality approach by the OCC hinders its ability to develop appropriate policies to tackle the vicious circle between climate change-enhancing financing and risks that it represents to the banks. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their 7ECB Guide on climate-related and environmental risks setting supervisory expectations relating to risk management and disclosure has been in place since November 2020. 8ECB, The clock is ticking for banks to manage climate and environmental risks, Supervision Newsletter, 18 August 2021. 9BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory, Development of tools and mechanisms for the integration of ESG factors into the EU banking prudential framework and into banks' business strategies and investment policies, Final Study, May 2021 (published 27 August 2021); Executive Summary, p. 3, 7. 4
own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? There is currently a significant lack of data and climate models and metrics are still very much under development. There are too many uncertainties over exactly when and how the impacts of climate change will materialize. This means it is still not possible to quantify climate-related financial risks. The process of properly developing these models, metrics, tools, developing indicators and collecting data should continue to try and reach this goal with the degree of accuracy possible, whilst realizing that due to the specific features of climate-related financial risks, as outlined above, modeling these risks will likely never be possible with sufficient degree of precision. In the meantime action is needed to address the absolute and scientifically asserted certainty that climate change is and will have devastating impacts that will either require or force significant changes to financial markets and economies. Either through a managed transition or disruption as a result of climate change-related events. This certainty must form the basis for taking regulatory action to ensure that climate-related financial risks are not threatening financial stability and creating a pocket of untreated risk. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? Banks can have an important role in the transition to a more sustainable economy. They can use this role to mitigate their own exposure to transition risk, as well as in turn reduce activities that contribute negatively to climate change. By extension this then mitigates physical and disruption risks. Some large banks are already starting to make public commitments to divest from fossil fuels that do not start actively planning and proving that they are transitioning. There is an implied role for supervisors here to ensure the standardization and validity of information relevant to financial markets provided by banks. This role should become more explicit and give supervisors an active mandate to set science-based standards and methodologies for alignment of the banks´ portfolios with the Paris agreement goals, transition pathways towards these goals and monitor their implementation , to ensure that banks set credible transition goals and stick to them. Scenario Analysis 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? The world’s leading supervisors have put a lot of value on climate “stress tests”as a tool to identify and manage climate-related financial risks across the financial system. These stress 5
tests have effectively been scenario analysis exercises so far. The results of these exercises do offer valuable insights into the climate-risks of financial institutions and potential channels and effects of their materialization. These insights in turn help shape supervisors’ actions and also raise awareness among financial institutions to enhance their risk management practices and adapt business models. However, there are significant limitations to the so-called “stress tests”, which can be found in Finance Watch’s report “A silver bullet against green swans”.10 A fundamental point that needs to be further explored is the transmission channels between climate events and financial implications for the balance sheets/capital of affected institutions. As the BCBS report from April 2021 highlighted, “Existing analysis does not generally translate changes in climate-related variables into changes in banks’ credit, market, liquidity or operational risk exposures or bank balance sheet losses. Instead, the focus is on how specific climate risk drivers can impact narrowly defined sectors of particular economies, individual markets, or top-down assessments of the macro economy as a whole”.11 The report concludes that significant further research and empirical evidence are required. The EBA pilot exercise on identifying and mapping climate risks in the banks’ portfolios reached similar conclusions.12 A key issue is that existing scenarios do not take into account the feedback loop, i.e. the impact which the financial sector itself has on transition and climate developments. There can be scenarios where the financial system plays a hampering role in transition so that the resulting impacts of scenarios (risks) might be underestimated. The ECB has made progress to overcome some of those challenges in its EU-wide stress test exercise; however, the ECB also outlined that a significant amount of work is yet to be undertaken towards “a comprehensive climate stress-testing framework”.13 The limitations of climate scenario exercises were confirmed by the NGFS based on the experience of 30 central banks and supervisors across the world.14 10Symon, Julia, A silver bullet against green swans: Incorporating climate-related financial risk into bank and insurance prudential rules, November 2021. 11BCBS, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels, April 2021, p. 2. 12EBA, Mapping climate risk: Main findings from the EU-wide pilot exercise, 21 May 2021. 13S. Alogoskoufis, N. Dunz et al, ECB economy-wide climate stress test: Methodology and results, ECB Occasional Paper Series, No 281, September 2021, p. 64-67. Some of the most notable of advancements have been the following: i) analysis of banks´ credit and market portfolios at exposure level, thus accounting for firm-specific vulnerabilities to climate risk factors; ii) capturing key transmission channels of climate risks by means of employing models specifically developed for the exercise; iii) analysis of the interactions between physical and transmission risks. Yet, with reference to the identified limitations, the following avenues of future work have been outlined in the ECB report: i) modeling of the banks’ endogenous reactions and their feedback loop to real economy; ii) consideration of additional physical risk hazards; iii) inclusion of additional sets of bank portfolios such as retail portfolio, which could not be considered due to lack of sufficient data or of sufficient granularity; iv) modeling contagion dynamics in the financing sector that could amplify the impact of climate risks. 14NGFS, Scenarios in Action: A progress report on global supervisory and central bank climate scenario exercises, Technical document, October 2021. 6","Finance Watch provides feedback on the OCC's principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks, emphasizing that principles-based guidance alone is insufficient. They advocate for a precautionary approach and a holistic review of bank prudential regulation to manage these risks effectively. The feedback highlights the systemic nature of climate risks, suggesting that all banks, regardless of size, should adhere to these principles due to the interconnectedness of financial markets and the global impact of climate change. Finance Watch stresses the need for regulatory action to ensure proper management of climate-related risks, noting challenges such as the unpredictability of ""green swans,"" data gaps, and the lack of incentives for private agents to consider environmental impacts. They call for international coordination, improved data collection, and scenario analysis to better understand and manage these risks. The feedback also critiques current risk management practices, noting that banks are not yet effectively managing climate risks and that existing methodologies are inadequate. Finance Watch urges the development of science-based standards and methodologies to align banks' portfolios with climate goals and emphasizes the importance of addressing both financial and environmental materiality."
kzm-gu8c-y6qp,"Ref: KIG/16/2022 February 14, 2022 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, DC 20219 Japanese Bankers Association JBA comments on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Sirs/Madams: The Japanese Bankers Association1 (JBA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks2 (hereafter “the Principles”), which provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposure to climate-related financial risks. We welcome that the OCC’s Principles are broadly consistent with the proposed principles3 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (hereafter “the BCBS Principles”), which will be a common baseline for internationally active banks and supervisors. We encourage the OCC to promote a domestically consistent approach as well with other U.S. agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board. Our member banks are in the process of implementing a climate-related financial risk management framework at a group-wide level, engaging with the relevant regulators. If financial institutions with global operations are required to comply with all the different guidelines in each jurisdiction, it would lead to ineffective risk management and a burden for banks. In order to avoid duplicative or different requirements for banks, we would like to ask the OCC to continue to coordinate with international standard setting bodies and jurisdictional supervisors. We would propose an interoperable approach where non-U.S. banks with U.S. operations can rely on and comply with the guidelines in their home country to the extent they are consistent with the BCBS Principles and broadly aligned with the future OCC guidance. For the same reason of avoiding duplicative or different requirements, we also encourage the OCC to coordinate with foreign regulators to harmonize supervisory expectations to the greatest extent possible. When incorporating climate-related financial risks into existing risk management, such as credit ratings and credit costs, there are a number of challenges, including different time horizons (an extremely long term for climate-related financial risks, which contrasts with current horizons used for existing risk management), and a lack of data availability and credible data (such as data on the relationship between climate-related risks and credit losses). Therefore, we recognize that it will require a considerable amount of time to establish quantitative financial risk management practices at the client level. Given such data challenges and the evolution of climate risk measurement methodologies/models, the future OCC guidance needs to be flexible and principle-based. We would like the OCC to provide sufficient time for implementation of the future OCC guidance, incorporating the progress of international discussions and allowing us to take a phased approach to implementation. Also due to the challenges stated above, we believe that it will also be premature to include an expectation that banks incorporate climate-related financial risks into their capital and liquidity planning processes at this point 1 The Japanese Bankers Association is the leading trade association for banks, bank holding companies and bankers associations in Japan. As of February 14, 2022, JBA has 114 Full Members (banks), 3 Bank Holding Company Members (bank holding companies), 77 Associate Members (banks & bank holding companies), 58 Special Members (regionally-based bankers associations) and one Sub- Associate Member for a total of 253 members. Several of its largest member banks are active participants in the U.S. financial markets. 2 https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62a.pdf 3 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Consultative Document: Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d530.pdf 1
in time, and that further data and development of quantitative tools and methodologies is needed. Comments on the General Principles Strategic Planning Given a lot of uncertainty around climate-related financial risks and data gaps, it will take a reasonable amount of time to fully incorporate climate-related financial risks into business strategy and capital/risk appetite. We would like to ask the OCC to allow banks to integrate climate-related financial risks into strategic planning based on the data and methodologies that are available at this stage. Scenario Analysis We welcome the approach taken by the Principles, which recognize the distinction between scenario analysis and traditional stress testing based on their different purposes. We believe that the future OCC guidance also needs to clearly differentiate between scenario analysis and stress testing. We also support the idea that “management should develop and implement climate-related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile” as stated in the Principles. Comments on the Management of Risk Areas Liquidity Risk, Other Financial Risk, Operational Risk, Legal/Compliance Risk, Other Nonfinancial Risk Further work will be necessary to understand the relationship between climate-related financial risks and liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, and other financial/nonfinancial risk. In particular, we should achieve a consistent and common understanding (measurement or methodology) of the transmission channel from the risk driver of climate-related financial risks to each risk. Therefore, it might be premature at this stage to require banks to incorporate specific risk mitigation tools for those risks in the future OCC guidance. We would like the OCC to secure enough time to take these risks into consideration, and allow us to apply different time horizons for each risk category when implementing the guidance. Response to the questions Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? The Principles set out that they are targeted at banks with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. However, we believe that the scope of application of the future OCC guidance needs to consider not only asset size, but also to “reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models” in a comprehensive manner, as many factors can lead to material exposure to climate-related financial risks for banks. We agree that “all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks” as stated in the Principles. Therefore, we would like the OCC to clarify the rationale to apply the Principles only to large banks, and clarify that the definition of “over $100 billion in total consolidated assets” for non-U.S. banks mean over $100 billion in total consolidated assets in the U.S. rather than at the whole enterprise level. At the same time, we believe that it is not appropriate to apply the same guidance both to “U.S. banks with over $100 billion in total assets” and to “non-U.S. banks with combined U.S. assets of over $100 billion” and that the OCC should consider the circumstances and exposure to climate-related financial risks of the U.S. operations of non-U.S. banks in applying the Principles and future OCC guidance. 2
As noted above, we would also like to ask the OCC to collaborate with the Federal Reserve Bank to harmonize supervisory expectations for U.S. banks, so that all banks in the same circumstances will be subject to the same supervisory expectations. Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? Since globally consistent standards for addressing climate-related financial risks and appropriate risk management methodologies have not been established at present, we would like for the future OCC guidance to take a principle-based and flexible approach to enhance climate-related financial risk management practices going forward. Also, if the future guidance could provide good practices or case studies, it would help banks to enhance our capabilities for effective climate-related financial risk management. We would welcome further opportunities for additional review before the OCC finalizes the future guidance. General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? As stated above, due to a lack of a common consensus on methodologies and monitoring/reporting metrics, our member banks have been trying to explore how to develop a management framework on climate-related financial risks. Other challenges include a limitation on data for analysis and the establishment of a data system infrastructure. Therefore, we would appreciate it if public sectors and private sectors could jointly address these challenges, and we would like the OCC to consider providing sufficient time for the development of a risk management framework by banks. Current Risk Management Practices 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate- related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? For example, some member banks are using and developing the Risk Appetite Framework and quantitative metrics (KPIs/KRIs) and scenario analysis on credit risk and market risk. They have disclosed the impact of transition risks and physical risks in the risk management area in their annual report and sustainability report aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? Some member banks have developed and implemented a sound process for understanding and assessing climate- related financial risks. For example, one member bank has recognized climate-related risks as top risks in its existing risk management framework, and regularly reported the financial impact of climate-related risks to the Risk Management Committee under the control of the Board of Directors and the Risk Management Committee and the Investment and Finance Committee, which are the committees of the Executive Committee. It has also put in place a global and group framework where the chief risk officers in its group companies can share and discuss measures to address climate-related risks. 6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? 3
A clear common view of which time horizon is relevant has not been established, as they are still under consideration globally. For example, when incorporating climate-related financial risks into existing frameworks, such as credit ratings, consideration of different time horizons has not reached an international consensus. The future OCC guidance should allow for appropriate, risk-based flexibility across its supervisory expectations (e.g., scenario analysis and strategic planning) to account for significant variability over longer time horizons. In addition, although it is necessary to measure long-term risks, it is very difficult to predict how society as a whole will transition to a low-carbon economy or how each corporate will change its business in the long-term. It should be noted that when and how much risk appears depend on the assumptions and presumptions by each bank, and therefore it is the variation in measurement might be large. Therefore, we would like international standard setting bodies and jurisdictional supervisors to clarify the concept of the time horizon for measurement as much as possible, recognizing the need to balance these expectations with each bank's discretion to make its own risk-based determinations. 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? For project finance transactions, in general, physical damage from climate change (e.g. earthquake, flood, windstorm, etc.) is mitigated through insurance. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? For example, our member banks provide the following products: (i) Green loans, a loan product that finances eligible green projects such as investment in solar or wind power. (ii) Social loans, a loan product that finances eligible social projects such as investment in the operation of hospitals or affordable housing. Social loans can be utilized for climate change adaptation through projects related to disaster response and preparedness. (iii) Sustainability loans, a loan product that is a combination of social and green projects as described above. (iv) Sustainability-linked loans (SLL), a loan product that sets sustainability performance targets (SPT) based on a customer’s ESG strategy. The terms of the loan change depending on the achievement of the target. SLLs can take climate related considerations into account when the SPT is related to climate change mitigation or adaptation. (v) Transition loans, a loan product that supports the transition of corporations from high to low GHG emissions if the corporation has a transparent transition strategy (including targets) and appropriate governance structure to support that transition. (vi) Positive impact finance (PIF), a loan product that evaluates the social, environmental, and economic impact of a corporation’s business and evaluates whether or not the corporation is working to increase its key positive impacts and reduce its key negative impacts. Both positive and negative impact areas can be related to climate change. Most of the above products are provided in alignment with existing principles provided by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA), Loan Market Association (LMA), or United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? We agree that it is important for banks to take into account the impact of climate-related financial risks on LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities. We would seek further clarification on the OCC’s 4
expectations in this area. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? Our member banks obtain specific data, such as climate-related variables, industry-specific variables, and the amount of GHG emissions of individual firms, from vendors and public databases. A major concern with respect to such data, metrics, tools, or models is the gap between firms’ disclosures/strategies and the results of scenario analysis. As an example, banks recognize that carbon footprint is a useful source of information for their decision-making, as well as communication with stakeholders (e.g. investors). Therefore, banks would like to estimate CO2/GHG emissions from their portfolio as soon as possible. On the other hand, there are still many companies that do not collect or disclose their carbon footprint (Scope 1, 2 and 3). We also recognize that global standards for estimating carbon footprint have not yet been established. So, the current situation is that each financial institution is still conducting research for the introduction of standardized or consistent data. In such a situation, it is true that accurate risk measurement is difficult. The above-mentioned challenges could be solved by (i) the standardization of metrics related to carbon footprint measurement and/or (ii) the disclosure of carbon footprint reference data for each sector by governments/regulators. We would like to ask the OCC to continue to coordinate with international standard setting bodies and jurisdictional supervisors to standardize metrics and/or to encourage governments to disclose relevant data, as these activities are expected to boost disclosures for banks. Also, in order to obtain detailed output through scenario analysis, etc., elaborate management plans (for example, how to deal with climate-related risks) of corporate clients are required from the perspective of understanding long-term transition risks. Since the collection of these plans is likely to be very burdensome and time- consuming, we would like to ask for flexibility on the scope of risk measurement (for example, which industries or sectors should be targeted for risk measurement, etc.). We need a consistent and common understanding (measurement or methodology) for a transmission channel from the risk driver of climate-related financial risks, although we understand that the BCBS report published in April 20214 mentions the transmission relationship. A common approach would bring about enormous benefits, such as accelerating the risk assessment process in financial institutions and allowing comparison and benchmarking across the global financial system. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? We would like the OCC to leverage existing regulatory reporting requirements. Existing securities regulatory disclosure regimes need to be leveraged regarding banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks. Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? Standardized climate scenarios are used to analyse the climate impact on borrowers’ financial statements, and any missing variables are obtained from other sources. It is difficult to set assumptions regarding possible technological developments and the investments of each firm based on such developments, and there is a limit 4 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf 5
to incorporating firm-specific factors into the analysis. At present, we understand that there is no established methodology for quantifying climate-related risks, such as a VaR measure. It will take time to develop agreed-upon standards and methodologies. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? We would like the OCC to consider that uncertainties both in climate-related variables and macroeconomic variables will increase as the time horizon becomes longer. Therefore, due care would be required when analysing the results of scenario analysis. In all risk area, where standard practices have not been established, the direction of quantification methodologies for executing scenario analysis exercises needs to be indicated. As proposed in Recommendation 4.4 of the “Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk” published in October 2021 by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)5, we agree to using existing common scenarios, such as scenarios developed by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), and therefore it would not be necessary for the OCC to develop its own scenarios.

JBA appreciates the alignment of these principles with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's guidelines and urges the OCC to harmonize with other U.S. agencies and international bodies to avoid duplicative requirements. JBA highlights challenges in incorporating climate risks into existing frameworks due to data gaps and long-term horizons, advocating for flexible, principle-based guidance. They request sufficient implementation time and oppose premature integration of climate risks into capital planning. JBA supports scenario analysis but calls for clear differentiation from stress testing. They emphasize the need for consistent risk management across jurisdictions and suggest that non-U.S. banks should comply with home country guidelines if aligned with BCBS principles. JBA also discusses the importance of considering climate impacts on disadvantaged communities and the need for standardized data metrics. They propose leveraging existing regulatory frameworks and using common scenarios for risk analysis. Overall, JBA seeks collaboration with regulators to address data and methodological challenges in climate risk management."
kzm-u6pa-gqvv,"February 14, 2022 Chief Counsel’s Office Office of the Comptroller of the Currency A 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Submitted via: https://regulations.gov/ Dear Sir / Madam, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (“Request for Feedback”) MSCI1 welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Request for Feedback. As a leading provider of climate risk data and analytics to the global investment community, MSCI has collected climate-related and environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures from thousands of companies globally for over two decades and developed tools to assist investors in their analysis of climate and ESG risk to their portfolios. The systematic consideration of climate factors in the risk management process of banks and financial institutions is still at an early stage. For the purposes of our response to the Request for Feedback, we have analyzed how listed U.S. based banks compare to the global sector average on climate-risk management practice from our Financing Environmental Impact Key Issue ratings methodology for banks/lenders.2 Our research illustrates that the U.S. based banks lag the remainder of the global banking sector on selected indicators related to ESG and climate risk management practices. Please refer to Annex 1 attached, for detailed findings. For the purposes of this submission, we comment in more detail in Annex 2 on those matters where we believe MSCI’s expertise and experience to be most relevant. As a provider of climate risk data and analytics, we have an interest in the proposals and have the following general comments: 1. Enhancing the scope of banks covered. The physical and transition risks associated with climate change have the potential to impact banks of all sizes. Smaller banks with a less diversified portfolio and higher regional exposure may be more vulnerable to climate-related risks than larger banks with a wider geographical footprint and diversified loan book. This is supported by our analysis of the exposure of U.S. based banks to environmental risks in lending and underwriting activities, as well as limited risk mitigation (please refer to our response to Question 1 in Annex 2). 2. Using a well-established set of reference scenarios for stress testing. Technology exists today to quantitatively assess the resilience of investment portfolios to a net-zero climate transition and physical climate risks under a range of scenarios. The data and methodologies can also be applied to a bank’s business lines. To enhance the comparability of stress test results, a 1 MSCI ESG Ratings, research and data are produced by MSCI ESG Research LLC, a subsidiary of MSCI Inc. 2 Please refer to the MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology 7 World Trade Center | 250 Greenwich Street | 49th Floor | New York, NY 10007 | United States Office: T +1 212 804 3900 | F +1 212 804 2919 msci.com
single set of reference scenarios e.g. from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), that support the shift from a qualitative to a quantitative approach over a clearly defined time horizon would be meaningful. 3. Align with international standard setters to minimize burden and optimize results. We support the efforts of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to propose standardization of ESG disclosures that aim to capture issues that could be material to companies’ enterprise value. The ISSB has initiated the standardization of disclosures, with the release of a climate-related disclosures prototype with the guidance of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).3 The framework published by the TCFD has already significantly advanced the convergence of climate-related reporting to be more robust and consistent.4 We provide the following attachments: • Annex 1 Detailed findings of our research on U.S. based banks’ current approach to climate risk management. • Annex 2 Specific responses to the Request for Feedback. • Annex 3 Additional research paper references relating to the impact of a net-zero transition and physical climate risks on different asset classes and the use of climate scenarios for portfolio optimization, risk management and regulatory reporting purposes. We would welcome a discussion with your Office to provide additional granular information on how banks can determine climate-related financial risks that are material and various tools and strategies that are currently available to incorporate climate risks into their risk management framework. Please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss our submission. Yours Sincerely, /s/ Neil Acres Managing Director Head of Government & Regulatory Affairs MSCI Inc. 3 Climate Related Disclosures-Prototype 4 TCFD-2021 Status Report 2

Annex 2 MSCI responses to the questions posed in the Request for Feedback 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? We understand the focus of the Request for Feedback on systemically important large banks, but note that the high size threshold of USD100 billion in total consolidated assets may potentially exclude the vast majority of banks in the U.S. According to the most recent statistics from the Federal Reserve, there are only around 30-35 U.S. banks which hold total assets over $100bn.8 In our ESG Ratings, MSCI uses a rules-based methodology to identify industry leaders (AAA to AA) and laggards (B and CCC rated) according to their exposure to ESG risks and how well they manage those risks relative to peers. MSCI ESG Ratings serve as a tool to evaluate banks’ long- term resilience to financially relevant ESG risks, including environmental risks. As regards environmental risks for the banking sector, we measure how exposed banks are to environmental risks in lending and underwriting activities and assess their risk mitigation practices. As can be seen in the graph below, 40% of U.S. banks within the MSCI ACWI Index achieved a slightly above average ESG Rating of A as of January 2022, while if the sample expands to all the banks in the ACWI IMI Index – including small cap representation – this shifts to 40% of U.S. banks having a slightly below average ESG Rating of BB.9 8 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Large Commercial Banks, September 30, 2021 9 Based on companies in the Banks and Investment Banking & Brokerage industries that have Financing Environmental Impact as a weighted Key Issue 7

Taking the above findings into account, where the aim is to have a more comprehensive understanding of macroprudential climate-related risks, there may be benefits of lowering the $100bn threshold to bring in scope a greater part of the U.S. banking system through a phase-in approach. Alternatively, a proportionate application may be considered to align supervisory expectations with the risk profile and business model of the bank. Banks that are outside the threshold of holding assets over $100bn may be invited to consider these principles as a best practice. 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? Many of the leading regulatory bodies around the world that are focusing on climate-related risks have embedded a principle of proportionality to their supervisory expectations or rules. The Bank for International Settlement (BIS) encourages banks to develop climate risk management practices that are proportionate to their size, business model and complexity.10 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Jurisdictions that have already implemented climate stress tests for financial institutions may offer useful examples. In 2019, the Bank of England established an industry forum, the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF), to support further regulatory engagement around climate-related financial risk management, which was jointly convened by the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority to build capacity and share best practice.11 Out of the102 members of the Net Zero Banking Alliance, there are currently 9 U.S. banks.12 Two of these institutions are inaugural members of the Risk Management Association’s Climate Risk Consortium alongside 17 other U.S. banks. Launched in September 2021, the focus of this 10 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision - Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks 11 Climate Financial Risk Forum | Bank of England 12 Members – United Nations Environment – Finance Initiative (unepfi.org) 8
initiative is on setting standards and recommendations for climate-related governance, disclosure and risk management principles. 13 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate- related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? From our work with clients, we have seen interest by some large U.S. banks to integrate climate risk assessments into their enterprise level risk management system within established climate data modeling teams. These teams are focused on building a better understanding of quantitative climate data factors ranging from transition to physical risks. However, the number of U.S. banks carrying out climate risk assessments at this granular level is still relatively small in our experience. We also work with large U.S. banks that integrate climate-related data into their credit risk management process. Banks are able to integrate climate and ESG data into their centralized credit risk system to supplement the due diligence process of their underwriting activities. Adding to this, banks that operate asset and wealth management lines of business are integrating climate data into risk, investment, and portfolio reporting transparency processes to meet emerging regulatory standards, asset owner requirements, and to ensure that they are able to understand the short and long-term climate risks that may impact the performance of their portfolios. Beyond these areas, we also observe interest in climate and ESG products coming from capital markets and investment banking teams, sales and trading teams, sell side research teams and asset servicing. 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? Climate-related financial risk exposures should be clearly defined, aligned with the bank’s risk appetite, and supported by appropriate quantitative metrics. Materiality assessments should be conducted by the banks regularly to reflect the speed at which the understanding of climate risks grows and also the increasing frequency and scale of the risks themselves. MSCI is able to support banks to assess their material climate risks by providing access to over 900 climate change metrics including emission data, fossil fuel exposure, clean tech solutions and forward-looking indicators (see Table below) to facilitate integration into traditional financial risk and portfolio management. 13 RMA- Climate Risk Consortium 9

What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? No comment. 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? No comment. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? No comment. 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? No comment. 10
10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? A number of banks globally obtain a range of ESG and climate-related information and tools from MSCI. These include: (i) Investment portfolio MSCI offers the following tools to banks to identify, measure, monitor, report and control their own climate-related financial risks. a. External Reporting - Report to investors, shareholders and other stakeholders on the climate-alignment of portfolios, progress against net-zero commitments and alignment with key temperature thresholds. b. Climate Risk Management / Scenario Analysis - Identify and understand climate risk exposures and trends within and across funds and portfolios. Deepen insight into climate- related risks and opportunities, stress test portfolios and model scenarios to inform investment decision-making. c. Internal Reporting – Streamline internal reporting of risks associated with the transition to a net-zero economy and the physical manifestations of a warming world. Visualize climate risk exposures and trends at the enterprise level and across funds and portfolios. d. TCFD Aligned Reporting - Understand bank’s complete carbon footprint and report on climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets in line with the TCFD. Available as a managed service that features portfolio-data management, batch reporting and customization capabilities. (ii) Loans and lending activities Assessing climate risks in banks’ lending activities can be challenging, due to limited disclosure by credit counterparties. MSCI’s environmental risk exposure analysis includes: • A focus on commercial lending, as the environmental impact from this type of lending is easier to trace and quantify compared to retail lending. • An analysis of the commercial loan book to determine the lender’s concentration in different industries. • Assignment of an Environmental Intensity Score to each loan segment and calculating a Weighted Average Financing Intensity of the loan book. • Comparing the scores among all banks to arrive at a final picture of the environmental intensity of each lender’s loan portfolio relative to peers. (iii) Capital markets and investment banking In our continued engagement with U.S. based banks, we observe that they are incorporating the use of climate-related data and tools in their capital markets and investment banking divisions. For example, MSCI is beginning to provide ESG and climate assessments of pre-IPO private companies to support investment banking teams advising those companies. Banks’ sales and trading teams are also using ESG ratings and climate metrics to support issuance of OTC and 11
structured products that integrate ESG and climate considerations into their portfolio constructions. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? MSCI supports a framework that supplements quantitative disclosures with a qualitative overlay of a banks’ views on its climate risks and opportunities. However, “boilerplate statements” should be discouraged in favor of meaningful disclosure that explains how these risks and opportunities are being managed and how they might be expected to impact the company in the foreseeable future. MSCI supports alignment of public disclosures that align with the TCFD recommendations, particularly as they pertain to quantitative and forward-looking metrics and targets. We note this was also a recommendation (Recommendation 3.2) put forward by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in its Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk.14 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? MSCI agrees that climate scenario models, analysis or tools are of paramount importance to gauge the effects of climate change spread across various time horizons. Scenario analysis provides a powerful tool for banks to understand the implications of climate change for their portfolios. However, one of the major challenges is the use of varied scenarios and tools by banks, which means that results may not be comparable. Secondly, banks and financial institutions are expected to determine which climate-related and environmental risks are material in the short, medium and long term with regard to their business strategy by using scenario analysis. The assumptions can span from quantitative and/or qualitative factors and not solely based on historical experiences. We note that there are a range of models currently available in the market to assist banks with forward-looking scenario analysis for certain lines of business. Banks use tools made available by MSCI, such as Climate Value-at-Risk to gain a forward-looking lens when conducting scenario analysis. For example, by calculating the financial risks from climate change per security and per scenario, Climate Value-at-Risk provides a framework that can help banks identify and understand these risks and take necessary action for effective risk management and regulatory reporting purposes. The MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk model has three main underlying components which can be used separately or in aggregate: 1. Policy risk: This component aggregates future policy costs based on an end of the century time horizon. By overlaying climate policy outlooks and future emission reduction price estimates onto company data, the model provides insights into how current and forthcoming climate policies could affect companies. 2. Technology opportunities: This component is based on company-specific data on the patents each company holds related to low-carbon technologies, providing insights into 14 FSOC’s Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk 12
how companies’ strategic investments could affect their future competitive positioning in a low carbon economy. 3. Physical risks: This component estimates the impact and financial risk relating to several extreme weather hazards, such as extreme heat and cold and flood risk. An extensive asset location database comprising of over 400,000 company facilities has been overlaid with hazards maps. Based on sector-based vulnerabilities, each location’s climate-related revenue loss for eight extreme weather hazards is computed with the help of damage and business interruption functions. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? MSCI notes that using different models and scenarios leads to results that are not comparable. While this gives banks some flexibility to choose a model for self-examination, it is important for the market to be able to effectively compare the results of a prescribed scenario analysis on various banks. This could be solved by banks having a minimum set of specific climate scenarios to consider. It would further be helpful if the OCC guidance around scenario analysis were to provide examples of acceptable Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and/or Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs),and prescribe precise time horizons. Regulators around the world are adopting scenarios developed by the NGFS and requiring banks and financial institutions to align their climate stress tests accordingly (e.g. Bank of England15, European Central Bank16, Hong Kong Monetary Authority17). We observe that financial authorities, including regulators and supervisory bodies, are increasingly involved in assessing climate- related financial risks and conducting stress tests for banks and insurance companies to quantify their exposure to these risks. Such exercises were completed in the Netherlands and France, and are underway in the EU, UK, Australia, Singapore and Canada.18 More countries are expected to integrate climate-related risks into macroprudential regimes for the financial sector, in the future.19 We support improved climate data collection from banks to make stress tests comparable and evaluate whether climate change risks threaten financial stability. 15 Key elements of the 2021 Biennial Exploratory Scenario: Financial risks from climate change | Bank of England 16 ECB Banking Supervision launches 2022 climate risk stress test (europa.eu) 17 Pilot Banking Sector Climate Risk Stress Test (hkma.gov.hk) 18 FSI Insights on policy implementation No 34 Stress-testing banks for climate change – a comparison of practices 19 NGFS publishes the report “Scenarios in Action: a progress report on global supervisory and central bank climate scenario exercises” | Banque de France 13

kzm-vsqi-egkq,"February 14, 2022 The Honorable Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th Street SW Washington, DC 20219 RE: MBA Feedback on Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu: The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)1 appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) invitation to provide feedback on its draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (hereinafter “Draft Principles”).2 MBA is the national association representing the real state finance industry, including banks with over $100 billion in consolidated assets. Our response, therefore, reflects a focus on the mortgage lending and servicing activities of covered banks, including commercial, multifamily, and single- family mortgage lending and servicing. Specifically, we are focused on the impact of climate- related events that could result in increases in the credit risk associated with mortgages – and how these risks are managed. I. OVERVIEW The OCC issued the Draft Principles to address its concern that banks’ exposure to climate- related financial risks could affect the safety and soundness of banks and the overall financial system. From the perspective of mortgage lending and servicing, MBA agrees with the general principle that climate-related impacts to credit risk can be analyzed across various dimensions, including sectoral and geographic, to assess both current and possible future credit risk exposure from physical and transition risks, including concentrations of risk. 1 The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) is the national association representing the real estate finance industry, an industry that employs more than 390,000 people in virtually every community in the country. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the association works to ensure the continued strength of the nation's residential and commercial real estate markets, to expand homeownership, and to extend access to affordable housing to all Americans. MBA promotes fair and ethical lending practices and fosters professional excellence among real estate finance employees through a wide range of educational programs and a variety of publications. Its membership of more than 2,000 companies includes all elements of real estate finance: independent mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, commercial banks, thrifts, REITs, Wall Street conduits, life insurance companies, credit unions, and others in the mortgage lending field.

MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management February 14, 2022 Page 2 MBA also appreciates that the OCC is considering a principles-based rather than prescriptive approach, and is focused on leveraging existing risk management frameworks rather than calling for an entirely new framework. We urge the OCC to encourage other supervisors to adopt a similar approach, and we also urge supervisors to recognize that this an evolving area with an evolving understanding of the risks. With respect to scenario analysis, we support the OCC’s distinction between climate scenario analysis and regulatory stress testing and urge the OCC to recognize the exploratory nature of scenario analysis given the limited availability and nascent state of methodologies and models. Relatedly, the OCC should recognize that time horizons that may be appropriate for any particular scenario analysis will be a function of the purpose of each analysis, the context of the analysis, and possibly the availability of data. II. THE PROPOSED PRINCIPLES The Draft Principles arise from the OCC’s concern that “[w]eaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could adversely affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system.” The OCC describes those physical and transition risks as follows: Physical risks refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute, climate- related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, and chronic shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. Transition risks refer to stresses to certain banks or sectors arising from the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change.3 The OCC’s Draft Principles address those concerns by providing a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of climate-related financial risks by large banks, “consistent with the existing risk management framework described in existing OCC rules and guidance.”4 That framework includes general principles for: • Governance; • Policies, procedures, and limits; • Strategic planning; • Risk management; • Data, risk measurement, and reporting; and • Scenario analysis. The Draft Principles also apply those general principles across the established risk areas of credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal/compliance risk, and other financial and non-financial risk. Following its consideration of feedback on the Draft Principles as well as lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions, the OCC plans to issue guidance that 3 Draft Principles at p. 1. 4 Id.
MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management February 14, 2022 Page 3 would address the respective roles and responsibilities of boards of directors and management and, consistent with the OCC’s risk-based approach to supervision, “appropriately tailor any resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.”5 A similar approach may be adopted by other supervisors that oversee smaller banks, credit unions, independent mortgage banks, and other institutions in the mortgage industry, in a manner commensurate with their exposures to climate- related financial risk. III. CLIMATE CHANGE, CREDIT RISK, AND MORTGAGES The Draft Principles describe the OCC’s climate-related expectations around credit risk as follows: Credit Risk. The board and management should consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios. Effective credit risk management practices could include monitoring climate-related credit risks through sectoral, geographic, and single-name concentration analyses, including credit risk concentrations stemming from physical and transition risks. As part of concentration risk analysis, management should assess potential changes in correlations across exposures or asset classes. The board and management should determine credit risk appetite and lending limits related to these risks.6 This discussion of credit risk in the Draft Principles is of interest to MBA and its members who are engaged in mortgage finance. The impacts of climate-related physical and transition risks to mortgages are likely to be experienced principally in the form of credit risk.7 Acute climate-related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, heatwaves, and chronic shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification that result in damage to property securing a mortgage can result in unexpected costs to borrowers or losses to income, and can reduce the value of the property, all of which increase credit risk. Shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change can have similar impacts that also could increase credit risk. The general principle that climate-related impacts to credit risk can be analyzed across various dimensions, including sectoral and geographic, to assess both current and possible future credit risk exposure from physical and transition risks, including concentrations of risk, is reasonable as applied to mortgage credit risk. To the extent that identified climate-related credit risk is material, 5 Id. at p. 2. 6 Id. at p. 4. 7 Any increased mortgage default risk due to climate-related events could interact with liquidity risk for loans that are securitized, as well. Depending on the nature of the securitization, banks may be contractually required to advance payments to investors, even if borrowers fail to make these payments. Most of the current mortgage securitization market is comprised of loans and securities that include insurance or guarantees from government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises. As such, advanced payments typically are reimbursed by the relevant insurer or guarantor, though the entity servicing these loans needs sufficient liquidity to make advances until reimbursement occurs. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which millions of borrowers across the country exercised forbearance and skipped payments, showed that banks were well-equipped to meet these short-term liquidity demands.
MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management February 14, 2022 Page 4 it would be reasonable for those risks to be reflected in applicable elements of a bank’s risk appetite. We note that geography inherently is a key factor when assessing the risk of a loan secured by real property. Improvements over time in key tools, such as flood- or wildfire-risk maps and models, should foster improvements in the quality of such assessments. Assessing chronic physical risks, or transition risks such as those arising from changes in building emission standards or changes in consumer taste, will be more challenging.8 While there may be a geographic dimension to such risks, it may be more challenging to project appropriately stressful and plausible scenarios as to where or how such transition risk events could unfold. IV. MBA FEEDBACK In response to the OCC’s invitation, MBA respectfully provides feedback below on the overall approach taken in the Draft Principles, scenario analysis, time horizons, and impacts on households and communities. A. Overall approach We appreciate the overall approach to climate-related financial risk reflected in the Draft Principles. Climate-related financial risk is a long-standing risk factor that is likely growing more acute and is, therefore, subject to increased attention and analysis. The collective understanding of this risk, however, remains in its relative infancy. The OCC’s principles-based approach is, therefore, welcome and preferable to a more prescriptive approach. In the Draft Principles, the OCC also recognizes that addressing climate-related financial risk will require banks to leverage and enhance their existing risk-management frameworks – and not establish independent new frameworks for addressing this risk. While climate-related financial risk is not fully understood, it is important to recognize that banks do not face that risk unarmed. Consistent with its approach of leveraging existing risk-management frameworks, the Draft Principles also do not treat emerging climate-related financial risk as a separate, new category of risk. Rather, the Draft Principles recognize that climate change is a financial risk driver that may manifest itself in impacts on established areas of risk: credit risk, liquidity risk, other financial risk, operational risk, legal/compliance risk, and other non-financial risk. We note that these elements of the OCC’s approach are consistent with the approaches across prudential regulators described in a recent Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) report on climate-related financial risk:9 8 A recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff report shares this view as to the relative challenge of the different elements of climate change credit risk. See Blickle et al., How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks?, NY Fed. Staff Report, p. 3 (Nov. 2021, rev. Jan. 2022) (“Our findings suggest that the acute, physical risks to banks are not first-order. Banks’ resilience against such risks should reinforce the financial system more broadly. More chronic physical risks and transition risks may warrant more focus.” (citation omitted)); available at sr990.pdf (newyorkfed.org) 9 See FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, pp. 27-32 Oct. 21, 2021; available at https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf.
MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management February 14, 2022 Page 5 Regulators and supervisors of depository institutions—the FDIC, FRB, OCC, NCUA, and state banking supervisors (depository institution regulators)—expect supervised institutions to manage all material risks and undertake steps to operate in compliance with laws and regulations and in a safe and sound manner. As noted previously, climate-related financial risks may manifest through traditional prudential risk categories that are supervised under safety and soundness mandates. As part of their supervisory activities, the depository institution regulators expect to review within traditional prudential risk categories, as relevant, how effectively institutions incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management systems and frameworks, appropriate to their size, complexity, risk profile, and location.10 These elements of the Draft Principles effectively put banks on notice that the OCC expects them to be actively engaged in incorporating climate change risks into their existing risk-management processes. In addition, they also provide room for banks to have the flexibility needed to continue to develop approaches to identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate that are tailored to their respective institutions. For these reasons, we urge the OCC to continue the high-level, principles-based approach towards managing climate-change risk facing OCC-supervised banks and to work with other prudential supervisors to encourage them to adopt an aligned approach to their supervision of financial institutions’ management of climate-related financial risk. We also urge the OCC to appropriately temper its expectations by balancing its intent to increase banks’ efforts in the area of climate-related financial risk with the recognition that this an evolving area and, as such, banks are at the early stages of learning to assess and understand the nature of the associated risks. With such a balance, we urge the OCC to facilitate progress in banks’ efforts to integrate climate-related financial risk into their existing risk-management frameworks by engaging in constructive dialogue at different stages with banks and sharing information on applicable risk-management best practices. The Draft Principles may provide an appropriate foundation for such initial constructive dialogue. B. Scenario analysis One of the Draft Principles is that climate-related scenario analysis is emerging as an important approach for identifying, measuring, and managing climate-related risks.11 As the OCC describes, climate scenario analysis is a forward-looking assessment of the potential impact on a bank of changes resulting from climate-related risks. In contrast to traditional regulatory stress tests, climate-related scenario analyses may address a longer time horizon and explore various “what if” paths rather than near-term changes to economic or financial conditions. 10 Id. at pp. 27-28. 11 Draft Principles at p. 4.
MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management February 14, 2022 Page 6 We appreciate that the discussion of scenario analysis in the Draft Principles provides a framework of expectations without specifying prescriptive requirements for any particular type of scenario analysis. • Scenario analysis can be applied alongside existing risk management practices; • Climate-related scenario analysis frameworks should be commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile; • Scenarios should include clearly defined objectives that reflect the bank’s overall climate risk management strategies, which could include identifying and measuring vulnerability to relevant climate-related risk factors, including physical and transition risks, and estimating climate-related exposures and potential losses across a range of plausible scenarios; • Climate-related scenario analyses should be subject to oversight, validation, and quality control standards that would be commensurate to their risk; and • Climate-related scenario analysis results should be clearly and regularly communicated to all relevant individuals within the bank, including an appropriate level of information necessary to effectively convey the assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty of results. This element of the Draft Principles might also usefully include recognition of the relative immaturity of underlying data and methodologies. Many data providers, for example, are still in the process of developing and expanding on datasets that banks can integrate into their scenarios. As a result, banks may reasonably employ data assumptions or approximations to analyze the impacts of some scenarios. Consistent with the approach taken under Other Financial Risk, it would be useful to recognize that banks necessarily will work with the methodologies and data that are reasonably available and refine them over time.12 This particularly will be the case in scenario analyses designed to assess exposure to transition risk – for example, arising from future changes to building emission standards or changes in consumer tastes that could affect mortgage credit risk. We recognize, of course, that the assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty of results with respect to any scenario analyses should be documented and provided along with any communication of results, so that decisionmakers can gauge the level of reliance they can reasonably place on those results. 12 See id. at p. 5 (Under heading Other Financial Risk: “While market participants are still researching how to measure climate price risk, the board and management should use the best measurement methodologies reasonably available to them and refine them over time.”).
MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management February 14, 2022 Page 7 C. Time horizons The Draft Principles raise the question of the appropriate time horizons for risk assessment both in the context of determining when a climate-related financial risk is material13 and specifically in the context of the discussion of scenario analysis.14 This raises the question of whether there may be any preferred time horizons that banks will be expected to apply. There can be no single answer to that question. Time horizons can vary with the specific purpose of the scenario analysis. A scenario analysis used to assess the risk of a bank’s current mortgage portfolio, for example, may employ a time horizon that correlates with the expected durations of the mortgages in that portfolio. A scenario analysis for the purpose of assessing the risks of a bank’s business strategies, in contrast, may employ a much longer time horizon. In effect, the appropriate time horizon will be affected by the purpose of the analysis, the context of the analysis, and possibly by the availability of data. Longer time horizons, of course, also mean greater uncertainty as to the results. * * * MBA appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on the OCC’s principles and vision for large bank management of climate-related financial risks. This is an important and emerging area of risk that warrants attention. We urge the OCC to continue to rely largely on a principles-based approach to managing this risk, one that leverages existing risk management and supervisory processes, and that also provides sufficient flexibility both to tailor risk management to the risks of individual institutions as well as to the evolving state of climate change risk and the evolving state of the assessment of that risk.

kzm-x162-arft,"Comptroller Hsu, This issue is very important to me for the two obvious reasons, both personal and for the society as a whole. I fret every day about climate change and its effects on my immediate surroundings in SW Colorado. And I fret about the stability of an economy that currently relies so heavily on fossil fuels that just cannot continue to operate at their current levels without destroying nearly all life on the planet. Your role is pivotal, and I ask that you consider the greater good above all. 
I am very concerned about climate change and the lack of effort by our financial institutions to face this threat honestly and responsibly, and I thank you for this draft guidance. It outlines a framework for robust assessment, disclosure, and risk management that will force banks to reckon with climate change risk. I urge you to resist all efforts to dilute this guidance and to follow up with scope and details as broad as OCC’s authority allows. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change–a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance recommendations to banks that they incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business, plan for climate change over a long time horizon and update models as additional data becomes available, develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting limits, and make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interests of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The commenter expresses deep concern about climate change and its impact on both personal and societal levels, particularly in SW Colorado.

BPI supports the OCC’s efforts to develop and articulate principles-based guidance for climate- related financial risk management, which we believe can be helpful to both banks and supervisors as they work to ensure that banks identify and manage the possible manifestations of physical- and transition-related risks of climate change on their businesses and operations.3 Our members are 1 The Bank Policy Institute is a nonpartisan public policy, research and advocacy group, representing the nation’s leading banks and their customers.

I. Executive Summary Given BPI member banks’ experience in this space, we believe six overarching principles should guide the OCC in finalizing its climate-related financial risk guidance. These principles and associated recommendations are summarized below:  The principles-based nature of the Proposal appropriately reflects the diversity of climate- related financial risks to which banks may be exposed and the need for flexibility in the design and implementation of risk management approaches in this area. • The Proposal should reflect that that there is significant variability of potential climate- related financial risk outcomes over longer time horizons. • The Proposal’s Policies, Procedures, and Limits section should retain its flexible approach and acknowledge it would be premature at this time to require banks to establish and apply quantitative limits or thresholds for climate-related financial risk. • The Proposal’s Governance and Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting sections should permit appropriate flexibility in the design of reporting.  The final guidance should clearly acknowledge that banks’ approach to managing climate- related financial risk should be fundamentally risk-based, such that individual banks may tailor their risk management programs to the risks presented and calibrate that program to the risks identified. • The Proposal’s Risk Management section should clarify that for purposes of risk management, individual banks will need to define “materiality” in the context of their individual circumstances and risk appetite framework. • The Proposal’s Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting section should acknowledge that an appropriate, risk-based approach may lead individual institutions to focus on different aspects of their portfolios. • The Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section should acknowledge that banks have the flexibility to conduct scenario analyses at appropriate, risk-based intervals.

Office of the Comptroller -3- February 14, 2022 of the Currency  The final guidance and its underlying expectations should reflect the fact that data and tools to measure and quantify climate-related financial risk remain nascent and not fully developed. • The Proposal should acknowledge that, in the near-term, climate-related financial risk metrics and reporting may be more qualitative in nature. • The Proposal’s Strategic Planning, Risk Management, and Other Nonfinancial Risk sections should reflect the nascent state of relevant data. • The Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section should reflect the relative immaturity of underlying data and methodologies.  The final guidance should acknowledge that it may be appropriate and beneficial for banks to support customers through their respective low-carbon transition plans. • The final guidance should not suggest that banks mitigate credit risk by establishing and managing to prescriptive lending limits.  We support the OCC’s recognition of the distinction between climate scenario analysis and regulatory stress testing.  We urge the OCC to coordinate with domestic regulators and international bodies to ensure consistent supervisory expectations with respect to climate-related financial risk management.

We strongly support the principles-based nature of the Proposal, which appropriately reflects that climate-related financial risks may vary significantly across banks and that there is likely to be considerable diversity in the specific risk management tools and approaches that individual banks deploy, particularly as efforts to identify and measure climate-related financial risks remain relatively nascent. We also support the Proposal’s acknowledgement that climate-related financial risk management processes may be developed and implemented within a bank’s existing risk management framework. We encourage the OCC to retain this overall approach in the final guidance, and to avoid the types of prescriptive or detailed mandates that are likely to hinder banks’ abilities to explore, test, refine, and adapt how they manage climate-related financial risks over both the short- and long-term. For example, it is important that banks have sufficient flexibility to develop and adapt their internal risk taxonomies, to make decisions about how to incorporate climate-related financial risks organizationally within their existing risk management framework, and to determine the relative materiality of climate-
Office of the Comptroller -4- February 14, 2022 of the Currency related financial risk exposures to the bank’s financial condition. To that end, our comments identify a number of specific areas where maintaining this principles-based approach is particularly important to provide banks with appropriate flexibility. A. The Proposal should reflect that that there is significant variability of potential climate-related financial risk outcomes over longer time horizons. First, the Proposal’s Governance section notes that relevant time horizons may include those that extend beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning horizon. While this attention to longer-term time horizons is relevant in the context of climate change, it is important that the final guidance acknowledge that there is significant variability and uncertainty of potential outcomes over longer time horizons. As a result, any expectation that the board of directors develop an understanding of future impacts should take account of this variability and uncertainty. Second, the Proposal’s Strategic Planning section notes that the board of directors and management should address the potential impact of climate-related financial risk exposures on the bank over various time horizons. Relatedly, the Proposal’s Other Nonfinancial Risk section states that bank boards of directors and management should monitor how the execution of strategic decisions and the operating environment affect the bank’s financial condition and operational resilience over time. The OCC’s expectations relating to longer-term strategic planning should allow for appropriate, risk-based flexibility to account for the significant variability of outcomes over multi-decade time periods. There is significant complexity and unpredictability over these longer time horizons due to, among other things, the high number of scientific, macroeconomic, financial, and other variables that can vary and must be taken into account when assessing climate-related financial risk. The OCC’s supervisory expectations should be calibrated to the usefulness of strategic planning over a given time period and recognize that substantial uncertainty exists with respect to the impacts of climate-related financial risk over medium- and longer-term time horizons. In addition, while a longer strategic planning horizon may be appropriate in the context of climate-related financial risk, it is important that such expectations not be carried over to other strategic planning exercises and processes, particularly those relating to capital and liquidity, for which typical planning horizons have been and remain effective. Third, the Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section notes that an effective scenario analysis framework can assist banks in evaluating the resiliency of their strategy and risk management to the structural changes arising from climate-related financial risks. Given the significant variability of outcomes over longer time horizons, supervisory expectations with respect to longer-term scenario analyses should allow for appropriate flexibility in approaches to developing and leveraging these analyses. Similarly, it would be useful for the OCC to acknowledge that relatively more resources and effort may be applied to shorter-term scenario analysis—where plausibility and degree of certainty is higher and therefore potentially more relevant for risk and business decision-making—and less to longer-term scenario analysis.
Office of the Comptroller -5- February 14, 2022 of the Currency B. The Proposal’s Policies, Procedures, and Limits section should retain its flexible approach and acknowledge it would be premature at this time to require banks to establish and apply quantitative limits or thresholds for climate-related financial risk. The Proposal would establish an expectation that bank management incorporate climate- related financial risks into policies, procedures, and limits to provide detailed guidance on the bank’s approach to these risks, in line with the strategy and risk appetite set by the board of directors. While this portion of the Proposal does not prescribe how banks should organize and implement these policies, procedures, and limits, any final guidance should be clear that the use of quantitative limits and thresholds for climate-related financial risk as a risk management tool is likely to be premature for many banks at this time.4 Rather, banks should be permitted to initially use their directional analysis to develop and inform their risk appetite and risk management frameworks prior to assessing whether any limits and thresholds would be appropriate.5 C. The Proposal’s Governance and Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting sections should permit appropriate flexibility in the design of reporting. The Proposal states that management is responsible for regularly reporting to the board of directors on the level and nature of risks to the bank, including climate-related financial risks, and that effective risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities allow management to capture and report material and emerging climate-related financial risk exposures, segmented or stratified by physical and transition risks, based upon the complexity and types of exposures. This description could be interpreted to suggest that climate-related financial risk should be reported on as a stand-alone category of risk. Climate risk is a transversal risk that may manifest in any one or more of the risk types that banks have traditionally managed on a dedicated basis, such as credit, liquidity, operational, and legal risk. Final principles on governance and reporting therefore should be flexible and recognize that climate-driven risks may be incorporated into and addressed through a bank’s existing risk management governance program—which may, for example, be designed around the risk types referenced in the OCC’s Heightened Standards—if the bank determines that this is the most effective means of risk management. The final guidance should make clear that it does not introduce a supervisory expectation that banks create new, bespoke governance structures and reporting regimes for climate-related financial risk as a standalone matter, as this would limit banks’ flexibility to integrate climate-related financial risk into existing risk management approaches and would effectively create a new risk type. 4 In addition, as discussed in section V.A below, requiring lending limits would not be appropriate at this time, as some banks already consider climate-related financial risks, particularly physical risks, in their credit underwriting processes as appropriate, and such limits could have unintended consequences on bank lending and access to credit. 5 This recognition is particularly important because banks may be developing their respective approaches to climate-related financial risk management in a phased manner with multiple dependencies. For example, banks may have established different prioritizations and timelines for data collection and standardization or scenario analysis.
Office of the Comptroller -6- February 14, 2022 of the Currency In response to the Proposal’s Question 11, we also do not believe that a new type of regulatory or other external reporting specifically directed at climate-related financial risk by banks is appropriate or necessary at this point in time. Many banks are already engaged in voluntary reporting efforts through the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as well as other industry-led reporting frameworks. III. The final guidance should clearly acknowledge that banks’ approach to managing climate- related financial risk should be fundamentally risk-based, such that individual banks may tailor their risk management programs to the risks presented and calibrate that program to the risks identified. As an important complement to a principles-based approach, the OCC’s final guidance should recognize that each bank has the discretion to develop climate-related financial risk management in a risk-based manner that is consistent with the concept of proportionality. This not only means that supervisory expectations should be tailored to the circumstances of each institution—including with respect to its size, business model, and client portfolio—but also that banks should develop and deploy various capabilities to the extent proportionate with the risk management utility and effectiveness of those capabilities, which may vary considerably. For example, supervisory expectations with respect to the scope and extent of data or scenario analysis capabilities should reflect the utility of those capabilities as a risk management matter, which is likely to evolve considerably over time. The final guidance should clearly accommodate these kinds of risk-based approaches, as described further below. A. The Proposal’s Risk Management section should clarify that for purposes of risk management, individual banks will need to define “materiality” in the context of their individual circumstances and risk appetite framework. The Proposal states that banks should employ a comprehensive process to identify emerging and material risks stemming from their business activities and associated exposures. We suggest that the OCC clarify that the meaning of “material” for purposes of risk management is distinct from materiality in the context of securities laws and it is for the individual bank to determine what is material in the context of its risk appetite and framework. For example, some important components of how banks may assess materiality for risk management could be the plausibility and certainty of risk (i.e., there will be potential risks that will be so speculative or distant as not to be material). This may be important for the OCC to recognize, as in practice supervisors may insist on deeming remote and uncertain outcomes driven by climate change as “material” in ways they would not for more traditional outcomes.6 6 It will also be important for the OCC to recognize that banks may not be in a position to evaluate the plausibility and certainty of the risk—and therefore make materiality determinations—at this time due to underlying data challenges. Relevant data must first be generated, translated, validated, analyzed, and weighted before materiality can be determined. As discussed in section IV.A below, banks generally are in the early stages of this process.
Office of the Comptroller -7- February 14, 2022 of the Currency B. The Proposal’s Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting section should acknowledge that an appropriate, risk-based approach may lead individual institutions to focus on different aspects of their portfolios. The final guidance should recognize that it may be appropriate for banks, given their individual circumstances, to focus initially on developing data capabilities and reporting on sectors, components of certain value chains, or other parts of their portfolios that they deem may be more subject to climate- related financial risks (e.g., portfolios subject to heightened physical risks or higher emissions sectors subject to heightened transition risks).7 Conversely, the final guidance should permit banks to determine that certain sectors or types of climate-related financial risks represent sufficiently de minimis risk that related reporting may not be useful or necessary. C. The Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section should acknowledge that banks have the flexibility to conduct scenario analyses at appropriate, risk-based intervals. The Proposal notes that management should develop and implement climate-related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile. Consistent with this guidance, banks should have the discretion to conduct scenario analysis at intervals that are appropriate to their size, business activity, and other factors, as appropriate. IV. The final guidance and its underlying expectations should reflect the fact that data and tools to measure and quantify climate-related financial risk remain nascent and not fully developed. The OCC’s final guidance should reflect the evolving nature and understanding of climate- related financial risks and the fact that existing data and tools to measure and quantify climate-related financial risk—and in particular, longer-term physical and transition risks—are only just emerging, and will need to undergo substantial exploration, refinement, and adaptation over time. Although data capabilities are improving, significant gaps in data sourcing, capture, standardization, and aggregation substantially affect the accuracy of projections and risk assessment.8 Given these challenges, the OCC should give banks due flexibility to develop, adopt, implement, and refine both (i) data capabilities and methodologies and (ii) quantitative risk management tools that depend on that data, such as risk limits, risk appetites, or scenario analysis. For this same reason, we also believe that it is important that any final guidance acknowledge and affirm that, in many cases, banks may need to rely on qualitative assessments and judgments about climate-related financial risks, particularly in the near-term while more sophisticated and standardized data and measurement tools are being developed. 7 The banking sector, private sector generally, and regulatory agencies are developing data capabilities as well, and the ability of individual banks to develop data capabilities in many ways depends on these larger efforts. 8 Climate-related data provided by borrowers and counterparties is often limited and not consistent or comparable. For example, while property, asset, and supply chain data are available for larger public clients, there are gaps when assessing smaller and privately-held clients or those in less carbon-intensive sectors. Further, and importantly, we note that emissions data may not necessarily be indicative of risk.
Office of the Comptroller -8- February 14, 2022 of the Currency A. The Proposal should acknowledge that, in the near-term, climate-related financial risk metrics and reporting may be more qualitative in nature. Data gaps currently prevent banks from being able to develop the kind of precise metrics that are conducive to developing quantitative thresholds, limits, and KPIs and KRIs to generate, analyze, and validate the kind of data needed to support those metrics. Accordingly, it is important for the final guidance to recognize that policies, procedures, and any limits as they relate to climate-related financial risk, as well as reporting, initially may be more qualitative in nature and may rely less on standardized metrics, limits, and thresholds. The final guidance should acknowledge that the development of a comprehensive risk identification process based on quantitative metrics may appropriately pass through an extended transition state that is short of the mature approach identified in the Proposal and may be useful only for limited purposes in the short-term. B. The Proposal’s Strategic Planning, Risk Management, and Other Nonfinancial Risk sections should reflect the nascent state of relevant data. Given data gaps and the evolution of climate and risk transmission models, banks are generally in the data collection and risk identification and measurement stage and therefore it will be premature in many instances to integrate climate-related financial risk into medium- and longer-term strategic planning.9 For example, an expectation that banks further incorporate climate-related financial risk into their capital and liquidity planning processes at this time would be inappropriate in light of the need for further maturation of the relevant quantitative tools.10 As the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recently determined, there is limited research and accompanying data that explore how climate-related financial risks feed into the traditional risks faced by banks.11 The final guidance should establish an expectation that banks integrate climate-related financial risk into strategic planning only to the extent that the underlying data and methodologies are sufficiently developed and tested, and further should acknowledge that banks may employ qualitative approaches in the near-term while data and methodologies remain under development. 9 We also note that the integration of climate-related financial risk management into strategic planning is distinct from the integration of public commitments with respect to emissions or other environmental goals into strategic planning. 10 Moreover, to the extent that banks are expected to incorporate climate-related financial risk into their capital planning process, it is critical that the capital planning framework maintains its existing parameters, especially as relates to time horizon, plausibility, and expected and unexpected losses. Banks already incorporate short-term, evolving physical risk into capital planning, as is appropriate given the purpose and goals of capital planning. 11 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels (April 2021), https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf.
Office of the Comptroller -9- February 14, 2022 of the Currency C. The Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section should reflect the relative immaturity of underlying data and methodologies. Banks are actively engaged in developing scenario analysis capabilities,12 and any final guidance should recognize the exploratory nature of scenario analysis given the data gaps and the fact that models and methodologies are evolving. For example, even the internationally established reference scenarios have developed granularity only for a subset of sectors. The final guidance should permit banks to leverage the results of scenario analysis in a manner commensurate with the maturity of the underlying data and methodologies. Further, given that this work is in the early stages, banks should have sufficient flexibility to develop and implement scenario analysis and related data capabilities over time. D. It would be helpful to banks if the OCC could provide initial comparative risk data among peer institutions. The OCC has requested feedback on what challenges banks face in incorporating the risk management principles articulated in the Proposal into their risk management systems, and how the OCC should further engage with banks to understand those challenges. One challenge in incorporating these risk management principles is that banks lack comparative data across peer institutions with respect to risk measures. This challenge exists because, unlike quantitative metrics for other risk pillars, for which there are generally known metrics based on accepted associated data, there is a lack of standardized and accepted climate risk metrics. It also exists because there are diverse sources of data that are available to banks for risk management and reporting, which makes it difficult to compare risk management and reporting practices across banks in a consistent manner. Until these risk measures are accessible and standardized, it would be helpful to banks if the OCC’s Supervision System and Analytical Support group could provide initial comparative data among peer institutions. V. The final guidance should acknowledge that it may be appropriate and beneficial for banks to support customers through their respective low-carbon transition plans. It is crucial that the final guidance acknowledge and affirm that it is appropriate—and indeed, in many cases desirable—for banks to support and serve customer needs over the course of any climate- driven economic transition. This recognition is not only important to ensuring an effective and orderly transition to a carbon-neutral economy, but it is also to be encouraged as a matter of safety and soundness, as giving banks the flexibility to support customers through that transition is likely to produce better outcomes for the bank in both the short- and long-run. This recognition also is consistent with previous remarks by the OCC about the potential consequences for customers when banks terminate these relationships.13 12 For example, many banks are onboarding sophisticated acute physical risk models to quantify asset and exposure impacts under more severe physical risk scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5). 13 Remarks by Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry, Institute of International Bankers (March 7, 2016), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2016/pub-speech-2016-25.pdf (stating that,
Office of the Comptroller -10- February 14, 2022 of the Currency A. The final guidance should not suggest that banks mitigate credit risk by establishing and managing to prescriptive lending limits. The Proposal states that the board of directors and management should consider climate- related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios and that bank management should determine credit risk appetite and lending limits related to these risks. Some banks already consider climate-related financial risks, particularly physical risks such as flooding, fire, and other severe weather-related risks, in their credit underwriting processes as appropriate, and banks are continuing to explore the impact of physical and transition risks on credit decisions as analytical approaches evolve and the climate data environment expands. It should also be noted that banks may already impose limits or certain thresholds for industrial or geographic sectors based on a variety of risk factors and it is not clear that any climate-related risk for such sectors would in any way alter or replace existing risk limits or thresholds; significantly more analysis is needed to make such assessments. As described above, however, the final guidance should clarify that the OCC does not expect banks to mitigate credit risk by establishing and managing to prescriptive limits on lending to certain sectors or otherwise. Such an expectation could have unintended consequences on bank lending and access to credit. The final guidance should recognize that banks are supporting these clients’ transition to a low-carbon economy across a necessarily long-term horizon, and managing any climate-related financial risks of doing so within the construct of their internal risk appetite and management frameworks. It also would be helpful if the final guidance recognized that the integration of climate- related financial risk into the credit granting and monitoring process is nascent and will improve as climate-related financial risk measurement techniques mature. B. We believe that banks have an important role to play in addressing the impact of climate-related financial risks on LMI communities. The Proposal states that the board of directors and management should consider climate- related financial risk impacts on, among other things, low- and moderate-income (“LMI”) and other disadvantaged households and communities. We agree with the Proposal’s statement that climate change could have a potentially disproportionate impact on the financially vulnerable and believe that banks have an important role to play in supporting LMI communities in response to increased climate risks. We also believe that partnership with the government is crucial to this effort. We recommend that regulators work with the industry to analyze impacts on LMI communities and how they can be best addressed in accordance with the existing banking laws and regulations. For example, through their rulemaking to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act, the agencies should consider how activities “[D]ecisions to terminate relationships can have regrettable consequences. Longstanding business relationships may be disrupted. . . . Customers whose banking relationships are terminated and who cannot make alternate banking arrangements elsewhere may effectively be cut off from the regulated financial system altogether.”).
Office of the Comptroller -11- February 14, 2022 of the Currency to improve the climate resilience of LMI communities receive CRA credit. For example, the agencies should clearly articulate which types of activities, for both individual properties and large-scale community projects, would be eligible for CRA credit. Further, given the importance of housing to CRA plans and the complexity of risk pricing and insurance impacts that may affect long-term value and wealth preservation in impacted communities, it is essential for the agencies to consult and coordinate with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ensure transition externalities are addressed in a manner that balances safety, soundness, and fairness. Policy responses to the issue of climate-related financial risk could also be advanced through coordination with the federal housing agencies and government- sponsored enterprises to improve other relevant federal programs, such as flood insurance. VI. We support the OCC’s recognition of the distinction between climate scenario analysis and regulatory stress testing. The Proposal notes that climate scenario analysis exercises differ from traditional regulatory stress testing exercises, which typically assess the potential impacts of transitory shocks to near-term economic and financial conditions. We strongly support the OCC’s recognition of this distinction.14 As background, banks are investing in talent, data, and technology to build robust climate scenario modelling and analytical capabilities across all lines of business and risk types and running exercises across different parts of their portfolios to assess a range of plausible climate change outcomes. Scenario analysis frameworks are generally based on selecting discrete points along a spectrum of potential future global temperatures—leveraging output from organizations such as the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”)—which represent baseline, strategic, and stress scenarios. Publicly-available climate scenarios do not provide banks with the appropriate sectoral and regional granularity, however, to directly translate scenario output into readily consumable inputs for internal risk modeling. For banks, the value of climate scenario analysis can only be fully realized when the science-based or macroeconomic output (e.g., global oil price or oil demand from the transportation sector) is expanded into more granular financial impacts (e.g., electric vehicle vs. internal combustion engine sales volume or lithium demand from elective vehicle battery producers) that can be applied across a diverse set of client industries and sub-sectors. There is also a limited understanding of the Integrated Assessment Models that drive these scenarios, which makes it more challenging for banks and vendors alike to expand scenario output while staying within the bounds of the model. The OCC has requested feedback on what factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises. Given the significant work that is already underway within banks, as described above, and the extensive work that has already taken place through the IEA, 14 The FSOC report on climate-related financial risk likewise distinguished scenario analysis from stress testing, noting that the former is “exploratory in nature” while the latter is linked to regulatory requirements such as loss-absorbing capital. FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021), 90, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf.
Office of the Comptroller -12- February 14, 2022 of the Currency NGFS, and IPCC, we would recommend the OCC not develop its own bespoke scenarios for banks to use in scenario analysis at this point in time. It may be helpful, however, for the OCC to provide guidance as to which of these or other external scenarios might be useful for banks to use as they build out their capabilities, and for the OCC to affirm that banks have the flexibility to make appropriate judgments on the implementation of these scenarios. It will also be important that the OCC coordinates with the Federal Reserve on any efforts being undertaken to develop climate scenarios and modelling capabilities. Notably, it is important that any expectations with regard to specific scenarios for integration into risk management frameworks focus on severe but plausible scenarios and not exaggerated scenarios that unrealistically frontload physical and transition risks. VII. We urge the OCC to coordinate with domestic regulators and international bodies to ensure consistent supervisory expectations with respect to climate-related financial risk management. BPI urges the OCC to coordinate closely with its peer U.S. banking agencies (i.e., the FDIC and Federal Reserve), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and other international regulatory colleagues to help ensure that supervisory expectations for the management of climate-related financial risk, including with respect to scenario analysis, are consistent within the U.S. and coordinated internationally.15 Such consistency and coordination will be crucial to avoid the potential for duplicative or conflicting requirements imposed on banks, which would not only be burdensome, but would also likely undermine rather than support banks’ abilities to manage climate- related financial risk. Simply put, it will be untenable and counterproductive for larger banking organizations to be expected to manage climate-related financial risk one way at the depository institution level and another at the holding company level, or one way in the United States and another abroad. Successful management of climate-related financial risk is a global, enterprise-wide endeavor.16 Furthermore, we recommend any future guidance developed through the interagency process or at the international level be subject to robust public comment given that banks are at the forefront of some of the technological developments that are occurring in relation to climate-related risk tools and analytics.17 15 We support the OCC’s stated objective of establishing climate-related financial risk expectations applicable to all OCC-supervised banks, because climate-related financial risk impacts all banks, regardless of size. 16 As a global concern and as discussed in section VIII.A below, the final guidance should permit enterprise- wide climate-related financial risk management approaches to be established at the parent company level. This would have the benefit of accounting for the different structures of foreign banking organizations operating in the U.S. and allow for flexibility and tailoring in the application of the guidance. 17 Given that the management of climate-related financial risk is an evolving practice, we believe it would be appropriate for the OCC to update the final guidance as appropriate.
Office of the Comptroller -13- February 14, 2022 of the Currency VIII. Other Comments on the Proposal A. The Proposal’s Governance section should affirm that the board of director’s role in climate-related financial risk management is effective oversight of senior management’s implementation of risk management. The Proposal notes that effective risk governance is essential to the safe and sound management of exposure to climate risk and outlines key responsibilities of the board of directors and management with respect to climate risk, and indicates that the OCC intends to issue subsequent guidance to further distinguish roles and responsibilities of the board of directors and management. It is important that any such final guidance follow clear and longstanding legal and safety and soundness principles that clearly distinguish the roles and responsibilities of the board of directors and senior management, respectively, and not conflate the two. As discussed in a recent industry report issued by the Bank Policy Institute18 and consistent with the OCC’s Heightened Standards, a central tenet of effective corporate governance is the distinction between, and complementary nature of, the board of director’s responsibility for oversight of the business and affairs of the bank, and management’s responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the organization. Any blurring of this distinction would detract from effective governance by potentially reducing the board of director’s ability to perform its oversight role objectively and creating uncertainty as to roles and responsibilities. While the approaches taken by individual boards of directors will appropriately vary, we note the following relating to the core role of boards of directors and board committees: (i) directors should ask informed, probing questions of management, including with respect to the resources being dedicated to climate-related financial risk management;19 (ii) reporting to the board of directors by senior leaders with responsibility for climate-related financial risk oversight should generally relate to material risks, developments, policies, and/or other issues, consistent with the board of director’s role in guiding the strategic direction of the organization and providing effective and objective oversight of management’s performance; and (iii) the performance of core board of directors functions, such as oversight of risk management and control frameworks, at the various levels of the banking organization may be coordinated at the top-tier parent holding company level, taking into account the independent legal and governance responsibilities of subsidiary boards. In view of the foregoing, flexibility should be maintained to permit delegation to management on such matters as (i) organization of internal climate- related roles, responsibilities, and governance structures and/or (ii) review of any public statements to ensure consistency with internal strategies and risk appetites. 18 See generally, Bank Policy Institute, Guiding Principles for Enhancing U.S. Banking Organization Corporate Governance (Jan. 12, 2021 Exposure Draft Edition), https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BPI- Guiding-Principles-on-Enhancing-Banking-Organization-Corporate-Governance.pdf.

Office of the Comptroller -14- February 14, 2022 of the Currency B. The Proposal’s Strategic Planning section should establish realistic expectations with respect to public statements. The Proposal states that, where banks engage in public communication of their climate-related strategies, the board of directors and management should ensure that any such statements are consistent with internal strategies and risk appetite statements. The final guidance with respect to public communications should recognize the aspirational nature of external commitments and the fact that these commitments and plans will need to adapt over time as data and methodologies improve and external circumstances change. In addition, the final guidance should recognize that banks are already subject to a variety of securities and consumer protection laws and regulations that regulate the manner in which they disclose information and market their products, and that banks are actively engaged with the authorities enforcing these laws and regulations to ensure their public statements meet applicable requirements. Therefore, the OCC should calibrate its expectations as to the granularity between external statements and internal risk appetite statements accordingly. ** * * * Bank Policy Institute appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposal.

BPI highlights the nascent state of data and tools for measuring climate-related risks, advocating for qualitative assessments in the interim. They caution against prescriptive lending limits, suggesting that banks should support customers' low-carbon transition plans. BPI also stresses the importance of coordination with domestic and international regulators to ensure consistent supervisory expectations. They recommend that the OCC's final guidance should reflect the evolving nature of climate-related risks and allow banks to integrate these risks into existing frameworks without creating new governance structures.

kzn-1dyt-0tmc,"Comptroller Hsu, I am very concerned about climate change and the lack of effort by our financial institutions to face this threat honestly and responsibly, and I thank you for this draft guidance. It outlines a framework for robust assessment, disclosure, and risk management that will force banks to reckon with climate change risk. I urge you to resist all efforts to dilute this guidance and to follow up with scope and details as broad as OCC’s authority allows. 
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change,  and puts our planet at risk. 
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance recommendations to banks that they incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business, plan for climate change over a long time horizon and update models as additional data becomes available, develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting limits, and make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interests of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The commenter expresses strong concern about climate change and the insufficient response from financial institutions. They commend Comptroller Hsu for the draft guidance aimed at improving banks' assessment, disclosure, and management of climate risks. The commenter urges the OCC to resist diluting this guidance and to use its full authority to enforce comprehensive climate risk management. They criticize banks for continuing to invest in fossil fuels despite public commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that this endangers the planet. The commenter supports recommendations for banks to integrate climate risk management into all business levels, plan for long-term climate impacts, and ensure internal strategies align with public climate commitments. They emphasize the need for banks' climate risk management to influence supervisory ratings and highlight the vulnerability of community banks to climate risks. The commenter calls for strong final guidance from the OCC to minimize climate risk and protect against unsafe banking practices."

Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, D.C. 20219 Via File Upload to https://regulations.gov/ Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 – Public consultation on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu, It is a pleasure to submit comments on behalf of Ceres and the Ceres Accelerator for Sustainable Capital Markets. Ceres is a nonprofit organization with over 30-years of experience working on climate change. The Ceres Accelerator works to transform the practices and policies that govern capital markets in order to reduce the worst financial impacts of the climate crisis. It spurs capital market influencers to act on climate change as a systemic financial risk—driving the large-scale behavior and systems change needed to achieve a just and sustainable future and a net zero emissions economy. Ceres works with leading global investors and companies. Our Investor Network is currently 217 investors that collectively manage over $49 trillion in assets. Ceres is a founding partner of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and the Paris Aligned Investor Initiative, which includes investors focused on sustainable investments within their portfolios and other assets. Our Company Network includes approximately 60 of the largest global companies with whom we work on an in-depth basis on climate strategy and disclosure, among other issues. We congratulate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for designing these Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We also congratulate the OCC for posing its “Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask.” We also agree with the OCC that weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control potential climate-related financial risks could adversely affect banks’ safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system. Below, we provide our comments to your specific questions related to the proposed principles. We have also included an attachment containing operational and tactical recommendations Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104
previously submitted to the OCC meant to further support your vital work on climate and the investments required to address the FSOC report recommendations (please see Attachment 1). Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? We agree with the OCC that all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate- related financial risks. Furthermore, although these Principles closely track the OCC’s existing management for large banks, they target only those banks with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets (i.e., the largest banks). While this may be a reasonable starting point, the OCC’s enforceable Heightened Standards Guidelines for risk management governance has a threshold for banks with over $50 billion in consolidated assets.1 Ceres hopes the OCC will utilize the $50 billion threshold, as $50 billion institutions are already expected to have a sophisticated risk management framework under the Heightened Standards Guidelines and should thus be capable of incorporating climate-related financial risks into their risk frameworks. Ceres believes that climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets, similar to cyber security risks and the coronavirus pandemic, posing grave threats to banks of all sizes and business models. Moreover this risk is only increasing in terms of frequency and severity. According to NOAA, in 2021 there were 20 separate weather and climate disaster events where losses exceeded $1 billion. Furthermore, these climate disasters killed 688 people and cost the United States more than $145 billion last year. These acute and progressive physical risks have the potential to seriously disrupt the bank market as well as the communities they serve. For example, more than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters in 2021 and more than 80 percent of Americans experienced a heat wave. Climate impacts are already manifesting in the largest state economies. In just the last few years, California has experienced recording-breaking wildfires, in both number and size, that have taken hundreds of lives, bankrupted the state’s largest utility, left millions regularly without power and brought home insurability into question. Florida is facing rapidly rising sea levels and now-routine flooding that are eroding coastal property values and wiping out freshwater supplies. 1 See 12 C.F.R. Part 30, Appendix D. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 2
Climate risk is an existential threat and, as recently stated by the thoughtful and comprehensive October 2021 Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Report on Climate-related Financial Risk, is one that poses an emerging and increasing threat to U.S. financial stability. As such, we recommend that these principles be adopted by all U.S. banks irrespective of asset size, location, or business model. Additionally, although your current consultation seeks to promote a principles-based approach to improving risk management and supervisory practices related to climate-driven financial risk, we would encourage OCC to consider making some or all of these prescriptive and enforcing them as mandatory requirements as opposed to voluntary best practices.2 It is important to note that the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other foreign financial regulatory agencies are already taking these steps.3 Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? We understand that the OCC has designed these Principles to initially target the largest banks. In general, Ceres recommends that, as banks and the OCC become more adept at incorporating climate-related financial risk management practices, the OCC lower this threshold to include more than the largest banks over time as these standards evolve. However, we acknowledge that smaller banks, community banks, and credit unions have different capabilities than the largest banks. The OCC should therefore tailor its approach to accommodate for those size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations differences. To this end, Ceres suggests the OCC implement an assessment program similar to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (FFIEC) Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT), which was launched to assist banks and examiners determine a bank's risk profile and level of cybersecurity preparedness.4 The OCC should develop a similar assessment tool for climate- related financial risk, providing resources to help banks understand supervisory expectations, and 2 We believe the OCC should use its authority under 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1 to finalize this guidance and issue the final document as binding safety and soundness supervisory guidelines. After these guidelines are finalized, the OCC should continue to create more in-depth requirements. 3 The OCC should make use of the data these prudential authorities and their regulated entities have already collected and analyzed, including scenario analyses and stress tests. 4 See Attachment 1, Appendix A. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 3
assess and mitigate those risks. Like the CAT, this could include a pilot program at smaller institutions to enable state and federal regulators to assess how these institutions manage and mitigate climate risks. Based on this program, the OCC should publish its observations, including findings regarding inherent climate-related financial risks and institution preparedness. Moreover, the OCC should use the data it collects from this program to develop a self-assessment tool to assist smaller institutions in evaluating those risks and their risk management capabilities. To reflect evolving science and scenario analysis with a focus on risk management, collaboration, and resilience, the OCC should continue to update and publish new data it and the other financial regulators obtain and/or analyze. Such a tool would allow the OCC to tailor its guidance for smaller institutions, and enable those institutions to develop climate-related risk management practices without presenting an undue burden. Ceres also recommends that future guidance assist banks in factoring the climate change-related transition, physical, and reputational risks of their borrowers into their capital, loan pricing and credit allocation decisions. Furthermore, we believe it is important that large banks do so on a sector-by-sector basis, with consideration given to the unique transition risks (including legal and reputational) and physical risks inherent in each industry sector and client vertical. We note that some large banks have already developed climate-related financial risk management practices in line with this guidance. For example, in December 2021 Citi CEO Jane Fraser stated that Citi will start asking its clients to measure emissions and that a borrower’s climate impact will factor into lending and capital allocation decisions. In fact, the January Citi TCFD report addresses some of these issues. Additionally, current approaches to climate risk modelling by large banks, treat climate risk in a manner analogous to credit risk. By this we mean that climate risk is quantified using sophisticated models, and capital or risk limits are adjusted to account for this risk. For banks without these capabilities, or where the cost of implementation would be prohibitive, we suggest that future OCC guidance treat climate risk in a more prescriptive manner similar to its operational risk guidance on cybersecurity. This approach could involve requiring in-scope banks to assess underwriting of climate-sensitive industries, and in some cases recommending the complete withdrawal of lending activity from high GHG-emitting sectors where the assessed risk threatens a bank’s safety and soundness. Further, banks must develop the ability to assess if climate-related transition and physical risks will cause certain assets (including trading book assets) to become so illiquid that they are effectively “stranded.” Future guidance should assist banks in developing plans to unwind such assets, or set aside more capital against these potential “stranded assets”. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 4
Finally, Ceres recommends that future guidance for banks and bank holding companies involved in the trading and marketing of non-renewable commodities (including physical energy commodities and physical energy commodity derivatives) include a requirement to disclose the impact of climate-related risk drivers (including operational risk) around these products and services. General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Ceres maintains an active and regular dialogue with U.S. banks of varying asset size, location, and business model. Moreover, most of the U.S.-based G-SIBs are members of Ceres’ Company Network. Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks currently use some form of climate- risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing to evaluate the transition and physical risks associated with their lending portfolios. The main challenges they face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems are technical in nature. For example, • Even with considerable client engagement, they face difficulty in obtaining borrower- specific climate data (for example, GHG emissions), and so they are reliant on third-party data to provide index information. • In some cases, they are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, or the most relevant scenarios do not provide sufficient detail in some areas critical to financial institutions. The OCC should also make clear that having a transition plan is a crucial part of a bank’s risk management system, and provide guidance as to how these plans should be formed. Additionally, the anticipated plans for the Securities and Exchange Commission to propose climate disclosure for public companies will have a beneficial impact for all banks to gain more comprehensive and consistent information from their large clients. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 5
Current Risk Management Practices 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate- related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? Many banks have identified specific tools and/or strategies in at least some detail in their general reporting, integrating climate risk into existing risk types and systems rather than treating it as a separate risk. 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? The OCC should provide clear guidance on the minimum requirements to conduct a materiality assessment. In conducting these assessments, banks should be required to report their results, including what data was used in the assessment to allow comparability across sectors, and an explanation of why information was determine material or not. Banks should also focus their assessments on financial opportunities as well as financial risks. Information banks should consider in making materiality assessment include context-specific metrics such as asset locations, local laws, and geographical information. Determination of whether such climate- related financial risks are material should mirror those determinations made in other risks assessments by a bank. 6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? Ceres research from 2019 shows that only one of nine banks studied is looking at a risk management time horizon longer than five years. Two others are looking longer term with respect to climate risk, but not for more conventional risks like credit risk or market risk. While there may have been some movement toward long-termism in the last two years, most banks are still focused on the one- to five-year time horizon. It is clear that to fully understand the climate risks banks face to their safety and soundness, they need to look at a longer time frame. In 2020, Ceres produced a report highlighting the risk due to transition risks of the largest banks. In 2021, we prepared an analysis of the physical risks of climate change to banks. Both of these reports highlight the imperative to have a longer time frame in the analysis. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 6
7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks have used, or have considered using both insurance and carbon offsets to mitigate climate-related financial risks. Regarding the use of insurance contracts, we believe that the residential mortgage divisions of large banks are directly exposed to the risk of insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal. Specifically, with the recent increase in acute climate-related physical risk comes the specter of home insurance price increases or possible denial of coverage in certain areas. For example, AIG recently announced plans to leave the California market due to climate risks. The most recent NOAA data shows that the U.S. has experienced 20 separate billion dollar weather and climate disasters in 2021. We believe that the bank market’s reliance on the availability of home insurance for its residential mortgage portfolio could lead to a climate-related gap in risk monitoring. As such, we recommend that banks study the potential impact of residential property insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal on the value, default rate, loss given default, and financing cost of residential mortgage portfolio holdings. We ask the OCC to consider including this risk in “Management of Risk Areas, Legal/Compliance Risk”. There is also risk for other portions of the banks’ portfolios. Our 2020 report highlights the risk by various sectors. With regards to the use of carbon offset credits (or other similar carbon trading schemes) as a risk mitigation strategy, Ceres recommends that the primary focus of banks should be on “absolute GHG reductions” through client engagement as opposed to “net GHG reductions” via financial engineering. As such GHG offset strategies should be used sparingly and only as a last resort. Ceres has produced a report, The Role of Natural Climate Solutions in Corporate Climate Commitments: A Brief for Investors to help banks and other end-users understand best practices when using this risk mitigation tool. Outside of insurance and offsets, banks’ relationships with their clients must be at the heart of any strategy for climate risk mitigation. Arguments that large banks “bank the entire economy” and as a result have no pathway to reduce their climate risk miss the critical role of client engagement and transition. Business within a sector can gradually be shifted towards companies with a higher share of sustainable assets and/or robust transition plans. The recently released 2030 plans from a few of the largest banks take initial steps with some of their client sectors. While actions are needed, these are good initial steps. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 7
For example, if a bank weighted its exposure to the utility sector heavily toward renewables and its exposure to the auto sector toward electric vehicles, Ceres analysis shows that some transition risk could be offset by the de-risking of green investments that would occur in a rapid transition scenario. Our analysis also shows the extent to which a bank’s vulnerability to transition risk is extremely sensitive to the choice of clients in climate-relevant sectors. The availability of “investable opportunities” is an important factor in how easy it is to mitigate risk through sustainable finance. The current structure of the economy will mean that most banks, particularly the largest ones, will have a “long” exposure to the business-as-usual case and a “short” exposure to the transition scenario. However, proactive banks may be able to capture enough sustainable opportunities to adjust this balance in a way that manages their overall transition risk. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks currently offer their borrowers a variety of “green” products, such as sustainability-linked loans, derivatives with embedded sustainability KPIs, etc. While we encourage banks to support their client’s climate risk management and sustainability efforts, banks should pay attention to the potential unique reputational risks these products entail, such as the risk of “greenwashing” by the bank and/or the borrower. Greenwashing is the process of knowingly or unknowingly conveying a false impression as to how sustainable or environmentally sound a product or service actually is. It can occur when the benefits conferred by the product or service are not material to the bank or borrower, or relevant to the borrower’s primary business activity. Similar to the SEC’s current initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct (SEC Division of Enforcement Climate and ESG Task Force), we encourage the OCC to include a requirement that bank compliance frameworks are updated to include greenwashing surveillance. As such, we ask the OCC to consider including this risk in “Management of Risk Areas, Other Nonfinancial Risk”. 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? For banks to credibly assess the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 8
communities, Ceres recommends that banks commit to principles of diversity, equity and inclusion and that bank board members and senior management are selected from a diverse and inclusive pool of candidates drawn from the communities that the financial institutions serve. Incorporating the principles of a just and inclusive economy is foundational to any effective climate risk management regime. Moreover, the OCC, FDIC, and Federal Reserve should incorporate into any new interagency Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations expectations on how banks should consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk on LMI and other disadvantaged communities. We have previously submitted comments on CRA to support this important work, and appreciate the OCC’s decision to withdraw the CRA requirements established by the prior administration. The agencies should develop CRA examination procedures to assess individual bank climate-related performance and to collect aggregate industry data on LMI individuals and communities. Further, Ceres recommends the OCC incorporate explicit considerations for climate resilience and race as interrelated stability risks which banks must address. This could include activities that support climate resiliency such as explicitly targeting LMI communities of color for investments in urban infrastructure to boost extreme weather resilience; investments in renewable energy and water conservation projects for affordable housing to reduce utility payments; investments in flood resilience activities; and installation of air conditioning in multifamily buildings to reduce heat risks and utility payments.5 Likewise, the OCC should incorporate the insights and analysis produced by the Financial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC)6 - of which the OCC is a member - into its expectations on how banks consider climate-related financial risks on LMI and other disadvantaged communities. Additionally, to properly address the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households in LMI and other disadvantaged communities, bank board members and senior management must have proven climate risk management competence, training and experience. To ensure that board members have access to climate and ESG training, Ceres has partnered with Berkeley Law school to offer an online training program which 5 Although these projects exemplify the beneficial objectives of climate change resilience financing, it is not intended as an exhaustive list of activities that banks should consider in addressing the impacts of climate- related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on LMI communities and communities of color. 6 Under FSOC recommendations 1.8 and 1.9, Treasury and FLEC members should “evaluate climate- related impacts and the impacts of proposed policy solutions on financially vulnerable populations when assessing the impact of climate change on the economy and the financial system,” and “engage other members ... to analyze and understand the impact of climate change on the financial well-being of financially vulnerable populations.” Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 9
pinpoints how corporate board members can embed ESG into their oversight role. We encourage all bank board directors to participate in appropriate continuing education on these vital issues. We also encourage banks to build on their current efforts to include diverse voices into various levels of decision-making. It is important to have individuals representing different life experiences to advice on key financial decisions. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? Ceres has published two reports on climate-related financial risks for banks – one on Transition Risk and another on Physical Risk. In these reports, we recommend that banks engage with their borrowing clients on a sector-by-sector basis to obtain climate-relevant data, with consideration given to the unique transition risks (including legal and reputational) and physical risks inherent to each industry sector. Banks should update or refine their decisions based on this data as they obtain new information. Specifically we recommend that banks obtain the following data in support of effective climate risk management: • Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions data from borrowers, • Information on planned capital expenditures and their likely impact on company emissions, as well as transition plans (if available), • Geolocational information of all critical borrower infrastructure, • Borrower climate disclosures prepared using the TCFD framework (banks should encourage borrowers to disclose this information using the TCFD framework to ensure that climate-relevant data is comparable across industries and geographies), To minimize compliance costs, the OCC should also encourage and incentivize banks to actively contribute to the development and sharing of climate-relevant borrower data, as appropriate. Banks should collaborate with customers, peers, academics, and regulators to obtain and understand these data. The OCC should also encourage banks to use a common set of standards, such as the PCAF framework, for measuring their Scope 3 emissions associated with Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 10
client activities.7 Without a standardized framework, it may be difficult to accurately assess banks’ risk and the effectiveness of their mitigation strategies. Additionally, banks can take action on many climate-related financial issues despite uncertainty in other areas. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services notes that institutions “should establish board governance and an organization structure that supports the effective management of climate risks and develop their expertise and capacity to assess and manage climate risks on both sides of their balance sheets.” Such actions could “be implemented with relative speed and confidence.” 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? In our two recent reports on climate-related financial risks for banks (Transition Risk and Physical Risk reports) we make recommendations that the existing capital adequacy regime be expanded to include climate stress testing with eventual adjustments to both bank liquidity and capital requirements. In 2021, Ceres also provided testimony to the United States House of Representatives on the importance of climate stress tests as part of an effective bank capital adequacy regime. Moreover, Ceres recommends that existing regulatory reporting requirements for banks be expanded to require the use of the TCFD framework to ensure that public disclosure of climate relevant information is comparable across banks of varying asset size, location, and business model. Additionally, as part of identifying and quantifying climate-related financial risks, Ceres believes that large banks should establish and disclose net zero plans which describe in detail how they plan to decarbonize their business activities and achieve net zero emissions by no later than 2050. These plans should provide practical, actionable steps for banks to create an effective net zero transition, including assessment of assets that may be exposed to climate transition risk, internal valuation tools, and disclosure of risk assessments that identify climate-relevant sectors and the percentage of at-risk assets in these sectors. 7 Investors are increasingly requesting companies’ Scope 3 data, and the SEC will likely include Scope 3 disclosures in its new climate disclosure rules. If the SEC does include Scope 3 in its rules, this will decrease the burden on compliance with any future OCC rule. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 11
Furthermore, large banks should set detailed interim decarbonization goals (for example, 2030 or 2040 Paris-aligned goals) and provide a timeline with regular updates towards achieving them. 8 Finally, all interim goals and 2050 net zero commitments should incorporate the latest science, use credible climate scenarios, and disclose decarbonization progress on a sector-by-sector basis. Banks should engage clients on their own climate strategies by, for example, requiring clients to provide data in key climate-related areas, such as energy technology and emissions profiles; aggregating those data using methods such as carbon accounting; and building climate risk into day-to-day decision-making tools, such as client earnings models. The OCC should also incorporate results from its recent Call for Papers regarding “net zero goals and their effects on key segments of the finance industry,” including “integrated assessment models and their usage in a climate-risk loss forecasting context.” We encourage the OCC to consider augmenting existing regulatory reporting requirements to include this additional risk-mitigating disclosure. Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? Ceres maintains an active and regular dialogue with U.S. banks of varying asset size, location, and business model. Moreover, most of the U.S.-based G-SIBs are members of Ceres’ Company Network. Based on our interactions, it is clear that the uses and challenges banks face regarding climate risk management varies greatly by size. For example, many of the largest banks currently use some form of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing to evaluate the transition and physical risks associated with their lending portfolios. The main challenges they face in advancing their climate scenario analysis and stress testing programs are technical in nature: • Even with considerable client engagement, they face difficulty in obtaining borrower- specific climate data (for example, GHG emissions). o In general, larger, publicly-listed borrowers are more likely to provide banks with climate data, whereas small to mid-size and privately-owned borrowers are less willing or able to generate this information. 8 For example, banks could validate their goals through the Science Based Targets initiative, a recently launched a methodology for banks to set targets that include financed emissions. Although aligning with this methodology will enhance comparability, banks should focus first on a goal that will incentivize action internally and reflect their risk management strategy to the greatest possible extent. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 12
• In some cases, large banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model or the most relevant scenarios do not provide sufficient detail in some areas critical to financial institutions. In contrast, the use of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing for regional and community banks can be characterized as being in its infancy. Moreover the main challenges they face in advancing their climate scenario analysis and stress testing programs are both technical and operational in nature: • Some regional and community banks do not yet consider climate to be a material risk factor, and so are not engaging their borrowers in obtaining climate-relevant data, • When client engagement does occur, borrowers are unable or unwilling to provide climate data (for example, GHG emissions), • In some cases, regional and community banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, • Furthermore, they are often waiting for regulatory guidance before investing resources in the design of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress capabilities. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? When designing and executing scenario analysis, at a micro-level, we believe that the scientific rigor and transparency of the scenarios are paramount. As such, banks should ensure that their scenarios: • Are science-based and aligned with the most current climate change science, • For transition risk, the scenarios should consider both an “orderly” and “disorderly” transition, • For physical risk, the scenarios should contain at least one ""worst case"" scenario, • Assumptions regarding both demand and prices for commodities (such as oil) should be transparent and clearly stated, and • Scenarios should be aligned with current best practices (i.e., IEA and NGFS scenarios). From a macro-standpoint, the U.S. regulatory regime has proven itself to be robust and flexible enough to meet the challenge of many recent perils. For example, through necessity and quick action, regulators have been able to successfully navigate new threats to bank safety and soundness such as cybersecurity and the coronavirus pandemic. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 13
Thus when considering which macro factors are most salient to designing and executing climate scenario analysis exercises we recommend that first and foremost the OCC continue to act with a sense of urgency around this existential and systemic threat. Second, as climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets and poses grave threats to banks of all sizes and business models, we recommend that these scenario analysis exercises should eventually be adopted by all U.S. banks irrespective of asset size, location, or business model. This could initially be tailored by bank size, with the threshold lowered overtime as more data becomes available to smaller banks, allowing those banks to build capacity. Third, the OCC will need to ensure that banks have access to educational resources in support of bank innovation regarding climate scenarios, models and data. Finally, we believe that climate scenario analysis exercises should eventually evolve into a formalized climate stress testing regime which informs regulatory capital adequacy metrics. Without climate stress testing (including a comprehensive capital adequacy regime), we believe that banks are at risk of running a higher quantum of enterprise risk than they are aware of, posing a danger to the safety and soundness of our financial system. Once again, we congratulate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for its fine work in developing these Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. Your leadership on this critical issue is deeply valued. We would be pleased to discuss any questions you may have on our feedback.

Attachment 1: Recommendations for OCC Action to Address Climate-related Financial Risks I. Recommendations for OCC Action to Address Climate-related Financial Risks 1. The OCC should issue an exam manual dedicated to climate risks. In its recently proposed Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks,1 the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) acknowledged climate risk is a cross-cutting risk that manifests through well-recognized and established types of risk. Among those risks, the principles highlight credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal/compliance risk, strategic risk, as well as reputation risk.2 With respect to each of these risks, the guidance lays out specific climate risk implications for banks to consider and address as part of the safe and sound management of their risk exposure. Ceres recommends that as the OCC gains experience with climate risk, that the agency issue an exam manual dedicated to the identification and management of climate risks based on established risk factors that are very familiar to banks and examiners. 2. The OCC should continue to use the Semiannual Risk Perspective and Bank Supervision Operating Plan repeatedly to highlight the seriousness of climate risks to institutions and the agency’s commitment to address these risks. We commend the leadership of the OCC for the many steps it has taken to understand and grapple with climate risks, including, first and foremost, proposing principles for climate- related risk management, appointing a Climate Change Risk Officer, establishing an internal climate risk implementation committee, issuing an RFI on a data tool for assessing physical climate risks, soliciting research on climate risk in banking to culminate in a June meeting, joining the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and participating in the Basel Committee’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks (TFCR). The OCC’s leadership is deeply valued. The OCC has already identified risks associated with climate change as a priority for the agency in both its Spring and Fall 2021 Semiannual Risk Perspective and Bank Supervision Operating Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 16
Plan. As the agency’s understanding grows it should use these two vehicles to identify its concerns with more granularity. The OCC should also leverage other forms of communication with the industry to clarify its expectations for managing climate risks including Qs & As and interagency pronouncements as it has done, for example, with financial innovation risk. See Appendix B. 3. The OCC should take a comprehensive approach to climate-related risk and issue binding Safety and Soundness Guidelines.3 Ceres commends the agency for issuing proposed principles for climate risk management for large banks and urges that the final principles and subsequent detailed guidance provide a comprehensive framework for banks to identify and manage physical and transition risks from climate change. Although guidance does not create binding obligations for banks, it does clarify agency expectations and examiners consider it as part of their supervision. The OCC has also issued binding guidelines in the past under the agency’s Part 30 authority to promulgate safety and soundness standards. These include heightened standards for risk governance for large banks with $50 billion or more in assets.4 The OCC should also issue binding guidelines under Part 30 for climate risk management standards for large banks. 4. The OCC should conduct a horizontal review of a targeted group of banks. The OCC should conduct a horizontal review to gain a better understanding of climate risk identification and management among a targeted group of banks. The OCC could use a horizontal review to gain an understanding across certain banks about their climate risk identification and mitigation strategies and practices. The OCC could target the large bank population that is the focus of its supervisory guidance on managing climate risks. This could also include the banks highlighted in Ceres’ reports with large exposures to climate risk through their syndicated loan portfolios,5 or banks with loan concentrations in particularly vulnerable geographic areas. The agency could use this exercise to gauge where the large banks are in their development and implementation of climate risk management practices in light of the OCC guidance. Further, the OCC could use these findings to inform the additional, more detailed guidance Acting Comptroller Hsu has mentioned is forthcoming and is also referenced in the proposed climate risk management principles.6 Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 17
II. Interagency Recommendations Interagency Case Studies and Recommendations Short-term actions by each of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) members individually is critical to address the risks to the financial system from climate change. While individual agency actions are important, collective action can sometimes send a more powerful and consistent message to the financial services industry. The benefits from the government acting on a joint or Interagency basis are clear. Such joint actions avoid conflicting or duplicative messages which create burden for industry and they can result in a more efficient allocation of resources by the agencies. Interagency Case Studies The agencies have demonstrated in the past that they can work quickly when they believe an emerging risk is significant and imminent. Appendix A details two case studies of timely responses to identified threats to the financial system. In the first example the agencies acted together over the course of 4 years to address the concern that the effect of the year 2000 date change on computer systems could have severe, far-reaching consequences for financial institutions. During the course of the 4 years, the agencies issued more than 20 interagency policy statements on multiple related topics, trained and deployed examiners who conducted multiple examinations at each institution, developed and disseminated educational content and conducted outreach, tracked and monitored progress, took action to address deficiencies and engaged in contingency planning. The second example involves the agencies’ collective action to address increasing cybersecurity risks. In roughly a year from identifying cybersecurity as a top priority for the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), the agencies had developed a risk assessment tool. The FFIEC quickly launched a dedicated page on cybersecurity for financial institutions and examiners, piloted a program at over 500 community institutions to assess management of cyber risks, published general observations from the pilot, outlined its cybersecurity priorities for the remainder of the year, and released a Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT). The agencies have since taken additional actions, but their collective efforts to highlight the importance of the issue, understand its implications for the regulated institutions, and give the industry a self-assessment tool, as well as a tool for examiners, in such a short period of time is instructive. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 18
These examples are evidence of constructive, timely, coordinated and effective actions agencies have taken collectively to address emerging issues. These examples provide a roadmap for interagency statements, guidance, outreach, training, examination, and accountability that could all be deployed in addressing climate risks. Recommended Interagency Actions 1. Conduct a Climate Risk Policy “Sprint” Regulators have begun to embrace the idea of a “Tech Sprint”. As you are aware, a Tech Sprint is a short, time-bound initiative to develop innovative and creative solutions to a specific problem in a collaborative way. Pioneered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the concept has been adopted by both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to solve challenging issues that transcend the capacity of one agency or organization to tackle. More recently, the FDIC, Federal Reserve Board (the Fed or FRB), and OCC announced that they are working on a Digital Assets Sprint Initiative (also called the Crypto Sprint) and just issued their first interagency statement based on the sprint. The purpose of the initiative is to increase collaboration and clarity around digital assets and involves a series of four sprints to address in a timely manner the many issues raised by cryptocurrencies. As stated by Acting Comptroller Hsu in his August 3, 2021 testimony before the Senate Banking Committee: The first sprint focuses on developing a common taxonomy for digital assets and agreed upon definitions to ensure a common language and understanding of the basic terms and concepts for future discussions. The second sprint centers on understanding use cases and risks associated with cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The third sprint concentrates on potential gaps in regulation and supervision and prioritizing those gaps for additional consideration. The fourth sprint will consider the policy needs based on the work conducted during the previous sprints. The FFIEC members should immediately create a Climate Risk Sprint initiative.7 This recommendation is consistent with FSOC Recommendation 2.1 (Fill data gaps) and Recommendation 2.5 (Data metrics and standardization). Using the Digital Asset Sprint Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 19
Initiative as a model, the agencies should conduct rapid sprints to first develop a common set of definitions to inform discussions and then review current and evolving risks to financial institutions. The agencies should conclude by collaborating in conducting sprints to evaluate the regulatory and policy gaps in supervision. Additionally, the FFIEC members could consider a TechSprint that involves the participation of outside experts – industry representatives, scientists, data specialists – to collaborate side-by- side with government officials to address potential data and technology solutions to assessing and managing climate risks. Such a collaboration facilitates new and beneficial connections and networks and focuses great energy and creativity to problem solving in a compressed time period. This type of TechSprint has been used repeatedly by the FCA and has also been adopted by the FDIC and CFPB. 2. Establish FFIEC Working Group As noted in the above case study on cybersecurity, the FFIEC was able to act with relative speed to address the rising cybersecurity risks to the financial system when it announced the creation of the Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Working Group (CCIWG). The CCIWG was formed in 2013 “to enhance communication among the FFIEC member agencies and build on existing efforts to strengthen the activities of other interagency and private sector groups” and quickly rolled out a series of announcements resulting in the release of the first version of the CAT in 2015. Similarly, the FFIEC should announce the creation of the Climate Risk Working Group, reporting to the Council through the Task Force on Supervision (TFOS). The purpose of the Climate Risk Working group would be similar to the CCIWG (i.e. enhance communication among members, and build on existing efforts by other agencies and private sector groups). The FFIEC can use the Climate Risk Working Group to develop a means to begin to assess and enhance the state of industry preparedness. Finally, the Working Group can identify gaps in the agencies’ examination procedures and training that can be closed to strengthen the oversight of climate risk readiness. The regulators could also consider establishing a body, such as the UK Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF), composed of industry representatives and convened several times a year by the Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 20
regulatory agencies.8 The CFRF has published a couple of best practices guides to assist financial institutions in identifying climate-related financial risks and opportunities. The latest guide is focused on risk management, scenario analysis, disclosure, innovation and climate data and metrics. 3. Issue Guidance through the FFIEC Using the CCIWG as a model, the FFIEC should issue Guidance to the industry to raise awareness of the risks, encourage financial institutions to integrate climate risks into their enterprise risk frameworks, and provide guidance on how to measure and mitigate risks, including through best practices. Guidance can be sequenced to first provide a declaratory statement that climate is a risk to both the financial system and to individual institutions. Subsequent Guidance can address first physical risks and then transition risks associated with climate change. Such actions can help fulfill FSOC Recommendations 4.7 and 4.8 (Review of supervisory and regulatory tools). Agencies can also help raise awareness by highlighting relevant events or milestones (see proposed Climate Risk Awareness Month below). 4. Develop a “Resources” section for climate risk on the FFIEC web page The FFIEC should develop a page on its website to list resources related to climate risk to the financial services industry. First, it can list all Guidance from the FFIEC or from the member agencies. The site could also link to other federal resources or agencies that offer helpful information. Given the increasing frequency of natural disasters, the agencies may want to create a section to consolidate interagency statements on regulatory relief for natural disasters. The agencies should also amend the Interagency Supervisory Examiner Guidance for Institutions Affected by a Major Disaster, adopted in 2017, which makes no mention of climate change. The Guidance should be amended to cite the risks associated with climate change and note that in many cases, natural disasters are no longer “exceptional”. 5. Create a Flood Insurance Resource Page and Update Flood Insurance Guidance Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 3305(g), the FFIEC is required to consult with the agencies responsible for supervising for compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program (FDIC, FRB, National Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 21
Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and OCC as well as the Farm Credit Administration) and develop uniform standards for use by financial institutions. While the Task Force on Consumer Compliance (TFCC) has had working groups to develop flood insurance compliance examination procedures for the agencies as well as Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance, no information on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is available on the FFIEC website. The FFIEC should take the following actions to both facilitate compliance with the NFIP by financial institutions as well as reduce the risks to financial institutions from uninsured and underinsured properties: ● Create a section on the FFIEC website devoted to flood insurance with information on the NFIP from the agencies or from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ● Issue updated guidance on flood insurance that incorporates risks from climate change Develop tools to facilitate compliance by financial institutions with the NFIP. ● Given that the flood insurance maps are out of date and do not reflect current risks, the agencies should encourage financial institutions to move beyond compliance with the Flood Disaster Protection Act and recognize that there are substantial flood risks for properties that do not lie within a flood zone. Financial Institutions should therefore consider the safety and soundness risks for uninsured or underinsured properties that lie outside of a flood zone when underwriting a mortgage. 6. Amend the Call Report Under the auspices of the Task Force on Reports (TFOR), the FFIEC should amend the Call Report to collect information on institutions’ climate-related financial risks, consistent with the FSOC Recommendations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.7 (Enhancing Public Climate-related Disclosures), using data terms defined by the Climate Risk Sprint (see above). The NCUA, as a member of the TFOR should also incorporate such changes into its call report for credit unions. As noted in FSOC Recommendation 3.7, such information collection should consider an institution’s size, complexity, and activities. 7. Amend the UBPR Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 22
The Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) is an invaluable tool for examiners to assess a bank’s financial condition and risks and to compare an institution with its peers. The UBPR, as a publicly accessible report, is also widely used by industry to conduct a peer analysis. The data from the UBPR comes directly from the Call Report. Following any amendments to the Call Report, the Task Force on Surveillance Systems (TFSS) should create standardized measurements of climate risk in the UBPR. Such metrics should be able to identify risks at individual institutions as well as risks among peer groups and in the aggregate. This recommendation is consistent with FSOC recommendations 2.5 (Data metrics and standardization) and 3.3 (Enhancing Public Climate-related Disclosures). 8. Host a webinar(s) for industry on risks associated with climate Over the years, the FFIEC and its member agencies have held numerous webinars and conferences for industry on various risk topics, including cybersecurity, Bank Secrecy Act/ Anti- money Laundering (BSA/AML) and the LIBOR transition. The FFIEC should host one or more webinars for banks and credit unions on the risks of climate to financial institutions of all sizes and the need to measure and mitigate climate risks. 9. Develop a Climate Risk Assessment Tool Following the creation of the CCIWG, the FFIEC released the first version of the CAT. The CAT was a unique development by the agencies; rather than releasing a regulation or regulatory guidance and expecting institutions to comply on their own, the FFIEC developed a tool to help financial institutions to understand and assess their cybersecurity risk and preparedness. This was particularly helpful to smaller financial institutions that lack the resources to conduct such an analysis internally. Similarly, the FFIEC’s Climate Risk Working Group should develop a Climate Risk Assessment Tool to help financial institutions, particularly smaller, community financial institutions, be able to identify their risks associated with climate change as well as their preparedness under various climate scenarios. By clarifying expectations, FFIEC members will address FSOC Recommendation 4.8 (Review of supervisory and regulatory tools). Ideally, the Tool would be based on accepted national or international standards and would provide financial institution management with actionable steps to mitigate risks. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 23
10. Include climate risk as a topic in the FFIEC “Supervisory Updates and Emerging Issues” conference for examiners The FFIEC provides specialized education and training for examiners from the agencies. One such offering is the Supervisory Updates and Emerging Issues Conference. The conference provides experienced examiners with training on developments in the financial services industry, including new products, new technologies, and emerging risks and other issues. The FFIEC should include climate risk as a topic in its emerging issues conference to update examiners on this risk to the financial services industry and the measures being taken by both regulators and banks and credit unions to mitigate such risks. 11. Use the upcoming modernized CRA proposed rules to Address the Disproportionate Impact of Climate Change on Low and Moderate Income Communities The FSOC report on climate-related financial risk explicitly recognizes that “climate change disproportionately affects financially vulnerable populations potentially including lower-income communities, communities of color, Native American communities, and other disadvantaged or underserved communities.” Noting that while vulnerable communities may be more exposed to climate-related risks, there’s also a recognition that actions to address such risk, such as through higher insurance and credit costs, may disproportionately impact financially vulnerable communities. The report calls for thoughtful and balanced policy responses. The interagency efforts underway to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules provide an opportunity for a thoughtful and balanced policy response. There are myriad ways in which the forthcoming proposed CRA rules could address the impact of climate change on low and moderate-income communities and communities of color. Ceres submitted two CRA- related comment letters.9 These include several specific recommendations for your consideration with the upcoming updates of CRA. 12. Update the Shared National Credit Program to account for climate-related risks Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 24
The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program assesses credit risks and trends as well as the risk management practices associated with the largest and most complex credits shared by multiple regulated financial institutions. The SNC Program is conducted by the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC for credits involving three or more regulated institutions for aggregate credit commitments of $100 million or more. The most recent SNC Report highlighted the high and increasing risk of leveraged loans as well as the industries most impacted by COVID-19 in the pool of SNC loans. The industries most impacted were oil and gas, entertainment and recreation, and transportation services. Given the size and impact of SNCs, the three federal prudential regulators should update the SNC review process to account for climate-related risks. While some SNC commitments could be vulnerable to severe weather events, other SNC commitments to industries that are highly dependent on fossil fuels may be affected by transition risk. To the extent that there are trends associated with climate-related risk, the agencies should highlight those in the SNC Program report. 13. Urge the White House to designate a “Climate Risk Awareness Month/Week/Day” at the federal level There are commemorative designations for each month, week, and day of the year to raise awareness of issues. September is National Preparedness Month; October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month. The federal government should designate a month (or week or day) to climate risks, including risks to the financial system. Congress can do so by enacting legislation but the White House can also provide for commemorative designations by proclamation.10 Dedicating a month or week to the risks posed to the financial and other industry sectors from climate change would help raise awareness of such risks beyond the environmental toll. Once designated, the financial regulators should promote the date(s) to help raise awareness.

Appendix A - Interagency Case Studies Interagency Coordination on Y2K Overview of Process Financial regulators began preparing for the Year 2000 date change (Y2K) as early as June 1996, when the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) issued an interagency joint statement concerning the potential effect of year 2000 on computer systems.11,12 To address potential challenges raised by Y2K, the regulators promulgated guidance and implemented regulations over a four-year period between 1996 and 1999. According to a statement in September 1999 from then-Comptroller of the Currency John D. Hawke, Jr., the effort consisted of the following actions13: First, we rigorously studied the likely impact of Y2K on the banking system and we calculated what it would take to prepare for it. Second, we looked at our own internal systems and earmarked the necessary resources to bring them to a state of readiness. Third -- and perhaps most important -- we began working with the financial institutions we supervise to heighten their awareness and encourage them to move with all due haste toward Y2K solutions of their own. We encouraged, we supported, and we cajoled. Through the FFIEC, we issued more than 20 interagency policy statements, dealing with such things as testing, contingency planning, customer awareness, and more. We even took enforcement actions in those cases where it seemed warranted. Leading up to the year 2000, bank examiners conducted Y2K-related examinations multiple times - between 2-4 times for each insured financial institution - and continued to oversee the largest banks. By September 1999, 99.7 percent of all federally supervised financial institutions had finished renovating and testing their systems -- “not just the systems that house their records and run their elevators, but the systems that bank customers rely upon for access to their funds.”14 Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 26
The FFIEC agencies also developed educational content such as videos and brochures for financial institutions to use in communicating to their customers the measures taken to ensure customer funds were safe.15 Comptroller Hawke detailed the steps the FFIEC had taken to Congress in April 1999 and said the interagency coordination consisted of16: ● Developing and disseminating detailed policy guidance to supervised institutions; ● Training and deploying examiners to conduct three or more onsite examinations of each institution; ● Setting up systems to track and monitor progress; ● Establishing and implementing vigorous enforcement programs to deal with deficiencies; ● Coordinating with other government agencies as well as private enterprises, domestically and internationally, to share valuable Year 2000-related information; ● Conducting numerous outreach programs to educate banks and the public; and ● Helping to organize and participating in a series of interagency contingency planning groups to plan for the orderly resolution of problems or issues that may arise either systemically or with individual banks. The FFIEC published guidance documents on the following topics and published an interim rule, which became final one year later, on Y2K-related safety and soundness standards for financial institutions. Guidance: ● The Effect of Year 2000 on Computer Systems (June 1996); ● Year 2000 Project Management Awareness (May 5, 1997); ● Safety and Soundness Guidelines Concerning the Year 2000 Business Risk (December 17, 1997) ● Guidance Concerning Institution Due Diligence in Connection with Service Provider and Software Vendor Year 2000 Readiness (March 17, 1998); ● Guidance Concerning the Year 2000 Impact on Customers (March 17, 1998); ● Guidance Concerning Testing for Year 2000 Readiness (April 10, 1998); ● Guidance Concerning Contingency Planning in Connection with Year 2000 Readiness (May 13, 1998); ● Guidance on Year 2000 Customer Awareness Programs (May 13, 1998); Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 27
● Customer Brochure on Year 2000 (July 6, 1998); ● Year 2000 Phase II Workprogram (July 8, 1998); ● Answers to Commonly Asked Y2K Questions (August 31, 1998); ● Frequently Asked Y2K Questions on Contingency Planning (December 11, 1998); ● Additional Year 2000 Guidance on Customer Communications (February 17, 1999); and ● Additional Y2K Questions on Contingency Planning (May 6, 1999). Deep Dive into Interagency Action on Y2K On June 17, 1996, the FFIEC issued its first interagency joint statement on the potential effect of Y2K on computer systems to the CEOs of all federally supervised financial institutions, senior management of each FFIEC agency, and all examining personnel.17 The joint statement cautioned that the two digit field ""00"" in the year 2000 that would replace “99” in records would be recognized as the year 1900, which would create erroneous data or cause a system failure based on incorrect calculations. The potential impact of Y2K could have affected “all forms of financial accounting (including interest computation, due dates, pensions, personnel benefits, investments, legal commitments)” and “record keeping, such as inventory, maintenance, and file retention.” The joint statement urged examinations to “review all aspects of computer systems to include those provided by service bureaus, hardware vendors, and other software vendors.” It stated that management must ensure: ● External vendors and servicers are addressing adequately the system and software issues related to Y2K; and ● In the event external vendors are unable to achieve the requirements, institutions have taken the steps needed to continue critical operations. The joint statement also outlined the following plan for financial institutions to mitigate Y2K- related risk: I. Establish a Year 2000 Team Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 28
A. Management should consider utilizing both internal and external information systems and audit resources to ensure that a risk-based Year 2000 Action Plan is developed. B. An inventory of all computer operating systems, applications and files should be created. All those with year 2000 issues must be identified. II. Develop an Institution Wide Year 2000 Plan A. The initial step in developing the plan should be to consider whether current systems and files should be modified, replaced, outsourced, or discontinued. It should be noted that even if new systems are purchased, old files may still have to be modified. (All computer systems, including mainframes, personal computers, local area networks, etc., should be considered). B. The year 2000 plan should also identify and prioritize applications and processes that are the most date sensitive and those which are most vulnerable. Interdependent applications should be grouped together. C. Management and the board of directors need to ensure that adequate funds and resources are allocated so that all year 2000 projects are completed in a timely manner. III. Year 2000 Plan Implementation A. Initiate pilot projects to test solutions to identified problems. It may be feasible to work with more than one vendor in order to evaluate their various solutions/capabilities before making a final decision. B. Begin the process of systematically implementing year 2000 changes by priority in accordance to risk. These projects should be conducted within the framework of the system development life cycle process currently in place. C. Conduct post implementation reviews to ensure the integrity and functionality of the modified systems. Interagency communications developed through the FFIEC were transmitted through the federal regulators to examiners and the financial institutions they supervised. The OCC relied on advisory letters to transmit the information, the Fed, FDIC, and Office of Thrift Supervision Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 29
(OTS) used press releases, and the NCUA used letters to supervised institutions to relay the information. On May 5, 1997, the FFIEC issued a second statement that set out a project management process strongly encouraging federally insured depository institutions to complete an inventory of core computer functions and outline priorities for Y2K goals by September 30, 1997. The statement provides that the “five management phases necessary to complete a computer conversion program are: awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation.” Banks were expected to largely complete programming changes and have testing underway for mission critical systems by December 31, 1998. The statement included in an appendix a questionnaire from the FFIEC Task Force on Supervision to help regulatory agencies conduct assessments of financial institutions’ planning efforts.18 Regulators used the results of these assessments to determine which supervisory reviews to prioritize based on examination procedures included in a second appendix to the statement. Conversion efforts were expected to be completed by mid-1998. In 1998, the FFIEC agencies also began supervising for Y2K-related risk for service providers and vendors in examinations, and they included risk analysis on a quarterly basis.19 In February 1998, the OTS began publishing a monthly newsletter for the agency’s 750 examiners and 1200 thrift institutions it supervised.20 Content included summaries of its findings from off-site examinations related to Y2K and the key OTS staff contacts for Y2K-related matters. In May and October 1998, the FFIEC hosted seminars for risk management planning that included as agenda items managing the risks of emerging technologies and Y2K concerns.21 On August 31, 1998, the FFIEC issued the first of three FAQs and answers (the FAQs) regarding Y2K.22 The FAQs focused on testing, documentation, and the FFIEC report distribution process. They also covered the following topics: ● Clarification of FFIEC policy concerning the types of testing documentation that Financial institutions should retain; ● Expectations regarding software and operating system upgrades in 1999; ● Conversions to new mission-critical systems in 1999; and ● Procedures for regulators to examine service providers and software vendors. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 30
On October 15, 1998, the FFIEC agencies published joint interim guidelines to adopt Y2K safety and soundness standards. The guidelines were implemented as a final rule the following year on November 29, 1999 with minimal changes.23 The standards focused on the following topics: ● Review of mission-critical systems for Year 2000 readiness; ● Renovation of internal mission-critical systems; ● Renovation of external mission-critical systems; ● Testing of mission-critical systems; ● Business resumption contingency planning; ● Remediation contingency planning; ● Customer risk; and ● Involvement of the board of directors and management. On December 11, 1998, the FFIEC published its second FAQ resource regarding contingency planning that supplemented the previous FAQs and clarified expectations for completing remediation and business resumption contingency plans.24 On May 6, 1999, the FFIEC published additional answers to three Y2K FAQs regarding contingency planning. On July 6, 1999, the FFIEC released guidance on Y2K-related fraud prevention.25 The guidance encouraged institutions to enhance internal controls and security procedures and to communicate with customers about how to protect against Y2K-related fraudulent schemes. It also issued a consumer advisory for financial institutions’ customers regarding Y2k-related fraud. On June 9, 1999, the FDIC adopted an interim final rule that required certain FDIC-insured banks to implement asset and liability backup programs so that financial records would be preserved in case it suffered a Y2K-related problem and had to be placed in receivership.26 The rule applied to FDIC-insured banks that scored less than “satisfactory” in their Y2K ratings on or after July 31, 1999. Following the transition from 1999 to 2000, the FFIEC published on March 21, 2000, a document detailing the lessons learned from its Y2K-related preparation. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 31
The FFIEC stated that it believed the institutions that were best prepared possessed most or all of the following 10 characteristics: ● Senior management and director involvement to ensure that the project plans were clearly defined, supported and monitored; ● Consolidation, elimination or integration of technology on an enterprise-wide basis by developing current inventories of information technology systems and applications; ● Improved oversight of service providers, software vendors and consultants; ● More formalized and effective strategies and standards for testing information technology systems; ● Detailed contingency plans that analyzed the effect of potential system failures on core business processes (e.g., deposit taking, lending, fiduciary services, etc.); ● Better safeguards to detect fraudulent, malicious, and negligent acts from both internal and external sources; ● Review of testing and contingency planning processes by internal auditors; ● Open information sharing for developing strategies and to respond to media reports or perceptions that could reduce public confidence in the financial services industry; ● Improved public relations with customers; and ● Thorough legal review to assist in vendor management, documentation retention, and legal defense. Cybersecurity Assessment Tool The FFIEC developed its risk assessment tool for cyber risk less than one year after recognizing cybersecurity as a priority. When he assumed the chairmanship of the FFIEC, Comptroller Curry announced cybersecurity as his top priority. On June 24, 2014, the FFIEC launched a dedicated page on cybersecurity to serve as a resource for financial institutions and examiners. The FFIEC stated27: While information security has been a core focus of supervision for decades, the FFIEC members are taking a number of steps to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks at financial institutions and the need to identify, assess, and mitigate these risks in light of the increasing volume and sophistication of cyber threats that pose risks to all industries in our society. The FFIEC Web page provides links to joint statements, webinars, and other information that may help financial institutions when thinking about the issue of cybersecurity.

It also launched a pilot program at over 500 community institutions to enable state and federal regulators to assess how the community institutions manage cybersecurity and mitigate cyber risks. In their assessments, regulators focused on: risk management and oversight; threat intelligence and collaboration; cybersecurity controls; service provider and vendor risk management; and cyber incident management and resilience. The pilot also served to help regulators enhance supervisory programs’ effectiveness, guidance, and examiner training. Within four months, on November 3, 2014, the FFIEC published general observations from its cybersecurity assessment pilot, including findings regarding inherent risks of cybersecurity and institution preparedness.28 Following the publication of its observations from its cybersecurity pilot, the FFIEC outlined its cybersecurity priorities for the remainder of 2015 on March 17, 2015.29 The priorities included establishing seven workstreams, including a workstream on developing and issuing a self- assessment tool for financial institutions to use in evaluating their cybersecurity preparedness and respond to cyber threats. The seven workstreams focused on the following topics30: ● Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Tool—The FFIEC plans to issue a self- assessment tool this year to assist institutions in evaluating their inherent cybersecurity risk and their risk management capabilities. ● Incident Analysis—FFIEC members will enhance their processes for gathering, analyzing, and sharing information with each other during cyber incidents. ● Crisis Management—The FFIEC will align, update, and test emergency protocols to respond to system-wide cyber incidents in coordination with public-private partnerships. ● Training—The FFIEC will develop training programs for the staff of its members on evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities. ● Policy Development—The FFIEC will update and supplement its Information Technology Examination Handbook to reflect rapidly evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities with a focus on risk management and oversight, threat intelligence and collaboration, cybersecurity controls, external dependency management, and incident management and resilience. ● Technology Service Provider Strategy—The FFIEC’s members will expand their focus on technology service providers’ ability to respond to growing cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 33
● Collaboration with Law Enforcement and Intelligence Agencies—The FFIEC will build upon existing relationships with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to share information on the growing cybersecurity threats and response techniques. Shortly after, on June 30, 2015, the FFIEC released its Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT)31 to help institutions identify risks and assess cybersecurity readiness.32 The CAT was intended for use by financial institutions of all sizes and was designed to be dynamic so that it could be updated as threats, vulnerabilities, and operational environments became more sophisticated. It also served to help examiners in their assessments of cyber risk. The FFIEC published resources to encourage use of the CAT such as “an executive overview, a user’s guide, an online presentation explaining the Assessment, and appendices mapping the Assessment’s baseline maturity statements to the FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook, mapping all maturity statements to the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework, and providing a glossary of terms.”33 On October 26, 2016, the federal banking regulators - OCC, Fed, and FDIC - published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to enhance cyber risk management standards for large and interconnected entities under their supervision and the entities’ service providers.34 The ANPR covered the following topics: cyber risk governance; cyber risk management; internal dependency management; external dependency management; and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Meanwhile, the FFIEC updated the CAT in 2017 to address changes to the FFIEC IT Examination Handbook and provide additional response options and practices and processes that represented the practices of the institution in supporting its cybersecurity activity assessment.35 The ANPR has not yet come to fruition as a proposed or final rule, however, in March 2020, the Fed was expecting further action on the enhanced standards.36 Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 34
Appendix B - OCC Innovation-Related Risk Case Study The Evolving Discussion of Financial Innovation-Related Risk In its first Semiannual Risk Perspective, published in Fall 2012, the OCC identified risk associated with financial innovation in the context of banks’ Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) obligations and expanded its focus as financial innovation accelerated in the mid-to-late 2010s. Consideration of financial innovation-related risk continued to build with the agency detailing for examiners supervision areas in operational, strategic, and reputation risk. The Spring 2019 Semiannual Risk Perspective featured innovation-related risk as a “Special Topic in Emerging Risk”. The agency’s focus continued this past year as innovation- related risk from digitization and e-commerce increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Below is a timeline summarizing the OCC’s discussion of such risks in its Semiannual Risk Perspective: ● 2012-2014 - discussion of compliance risk in the context of BSA/AML compliance; ● 2014 - Spring 2019 - expanded risk discussion beyond compliance risk to include strategic, operational, and reputation risk. The OCC continued to elaborate on these risks until financial innovation-related risk was highlighted as a Special Topic in Emerging Risk in Spring 2019; ● Fall 2019 - coverage of financial innovation-related risk was reduced to a brief discussion regarding operational and strategic risk; and ● Spring 2020 - Spring 2021 - discussion of risk increased based on increase in digitization due to COVID-19 pandemic. The first Semiannual Risk Perspective was published in Fall 2012 and flagged as a consideration for compliance risk challenges regarding BSA/AML “evolving money laundering schemes and technological developments.” The OCC continued to include technological developments as a compliance risk within the context of BSA/AML until Spring 2014, when it said, “[s]taff reviews will include applicable compliance, legal, and reputation risks posed by new products and services and emerging technologies, in particular, those that introduce higher compliance or reputation risk.” It also stated, “as part of their strategy to deal with competitive Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 35
pressures and lower overhead expenses, banks are leveraging technology such as cloud computing and mobile banking, which can increase exposure to additional technological risk.” As the OCC further considered new fintech innovations, it updated its Semiannual Risk Perspective to discuss their supervision. For example, in Fall 2015, the Semiannual Risk Perspective discussed BSA/AML risk arising from virtual currencies, and in Spring 2016, the OCC highlighted as operational risk bank competition with nonbanks and fintechs and increasing reliance on third-party relationships. This trend continued until it culminated in the Spring 2019 Semiannual Risk Perspective as a Special Topic in Emerging Risk where the significant increase in financial innovation was detailed and risks were dissected. For example, the report covers the following topics: strategic risk and challenges many banks face; changes in the federal banking industry; operational efficiency as a challenge for small banks; implications for the federal banking industry; and corporate governance and risk management. The Fall 2019 Semiannual Risk Perspective, on the other hand, touched on the strategic and operational risks of financial innovation. In 2020, the OCC renewed its focus on financial innovation, likely caused by significant shifts towards digitization and e-commerce, bank adoption of new and innovative products and payment mechanisms, and bank partnerships with third parties. These topics have continued to be a focus through the most recently published Semiannual Risk Perspective in Spring 2021. As the OCC elaborated on financial innovation risk in its Semiannual Risk Perspective in the mid-2010s, it also began highlighting these risks in its Bank Supervision Operating Plans as follows: For FY 2016, “the rapid pace of technological change” was identified as a focus area for Large Bank and Midsize and Community Bank (MCB) supervision in the context of AML/CFT compliance. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 36
For FY 2017, Large Bank supervision included compliance related to change management for implementing new platforms and technologies. Large Banks and MCBs supervision would continue to include technological change for compliance risk. For FY 2018, Mid-size and Community Bank supervision included operational risks associated with third-party relationships and introducing new or revised business products, processing platforms, and delivery channels. The 2018 operating plan also tasked the Compliance and Community Affairs unit within the Committee on Bank Supervision to supervise third-party relationship risk and assess compliance with BSA/AML to address risks from “evolving vulnerabilities resulting from the rapid pace of technological change, and emerging payment solutions and terrorist financing.” No discussion of financial innovation in the 2019 Operating Plan. For FY 2020, the Operating Plan was abbreviated to include priority objectives for supervisory units across the agency. One of the eight key risk areas identified is, “[t]echnological innovation and implementation, including use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, digitalization in risk management processes, new products and services, and strategic plans.” For FY 2021, three of the 13 key risk areas identified are: ● Proper oversight of significant third-party relationships, including partnerships. Examiners should identify where those relationships represent significant concentrations in operations, bank resiliency, or other risks. Examiners should assess risk oversight of third party’s own management of cybersecurity and resilience risks. ● Change management over significant operational changes. Examiners should evaluate governance over new technology innovation and implementation, including use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, digitalization in risk management processes, new products and services, and notable changes in strategic plans. Examiners will also focus on change management over emergency programs in response to the pandemic including the CARES Act and pandemic-related operating conditions. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 37
● Payment systems products and services, currently offered or planned, focusing on new or novel products, services, or channels for wholesale and retail customer relationships. Examiners should consider potential risks including operational, compliance, strategic and reputation and how these risks are incorporated into institution-wide risk assessments and new product review processes. For FY 2022, the OCC will supervise for the following three of the 11 key risk areas identified: ● Third parties and related concentrations: Examiners should determine whether banks are providing proper oversight of their significant third-party relationships, including partnerships. Examiners should identify where those relationships are critical to bank operations and understand whether they represent significant concentrations or impact resiliency. Examiners should also be aware of the cyber-related risks emanating from third parties and evaluate the bank assessments of the third party’s cybersecurity risk management and resilience capabilities. ● Payments: Examiners should evaluate payment systems products and services that banks offer or plan to offer, with a focus on new or novel products, services, or channels for wholesale and retail customer relationships. Examiners should consider potential risks including operational, compliance, strategic, credit, and reputation and how these risks are incorporated into institution-wide risk assessments and new product review processes, if applicable. ● Fintech/Cryptocurrency: Examiners should identify banks that are implementing significant changes in their operations using new technological innovations and evaluate implementation, including use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digitalization in the risk management processes. Examiners should evaluate the appropriateness of governance processes when banks undertake significant changes. Continuing its focus on financial innovation, in August 2021, the OCC, along with the Fed and FDIC, published guidance for community banks, “Conducting Due Diligence on Financial Technology Companies: A Guide for Community Banks.” The guide elaborates on six key due diligence topics: business experience and qualifications; financial condition; legal and regulatory compliance; risk management and controls; information security; and operational resilience. The Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 38
guide contains relevant considerations, potential sources of information, and illustrative examples to aid community banks. The OCC also published in March 2020 frequently asked questions (FAQs) to supplement previous OCC bulletins published on managing risk from third-party relationships. The FAQs include information on topics such as: ■ When cloud computing providers are in a third-party relationship with a bank; ■ When data aggregators are in a third-party relationship with a bank; and ■ The type of due diligence and ongoing monitoring that should be applied to fintechs, startups, and small businesses. Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111 ceres.org California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104 39","Ceres, a nonprofit organization focused on climate change, submitted comments on the OCC's proposed principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. Ceres supports the OCC's initiative and suggests that the principles should apply to all banks, not just those with over $100 billion in assets, as climate risks affect banks of all sizes. They recommend using a $50 billion threshold, aligning with existing risk management guidelines. Ceres emphasizes the systemic financial risks posed by climate change, citing recent climate disasters and their economic impacts. They advocate for mandatory, rather than voluntary, adoption of these principles, similar to actions by European regulators. Ceres also suggests developing a climate risk assessment tool, akin to the FFIEC's Cybersecurity Assessment Tool, to help banks manage climate risks. They highlight the need for banks to consider climate risks in lending and investment decisions and to develop strategies for managing transition and physical risks. Ceres calls for enhanced regulatory reporting and stress testing to include climate risks and recommends that banks engage with clients on climate strategies. They also stress the importance of considering the impacts on low-income and disadvantaged communities and suggest incorporating climate resilience into the Community Reinvestment Act."
kzn-1ec5-d43f,"February 14, 2022 VIA ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION Chief Counsel’s Office Attention: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th Street, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Ladies and Gentlemen: The Financial Services Forum (the “Forum”)1 appreciates the opportunity to submit this letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) on its proposed guidelines (the “Proposal”) on the effective management of climate-related financial risks. The Proposal is relevant to each of our member institutions, the eight U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies (“U.S. GSIBs”). At the outset, we wish to highlight that we welcome the Proposal, subject to certain changes discussed further below, for a number of reasons. Our members recognize the need for banks to have robust capabilities for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks, and in fact, already have taken important steps to incorporate such risks into their comprehensive, enterprise risk management frameworks. Accordingly, the Forum supports the OCC’s efforts to establish guidance for banks to address climate-related financial risks. Below, we comment on the specific principles from the Proposal that we support and highlight areas where the OCC’s guidance in the Proposal could be recalibrated. We also 1 The Financial Services Forum is an economic policy and advocacy organization whose members are the chief executive officers of the eight largest and most diversified financial institutions headquartered in the United States. Forum member institutions are a leading source of lending and investment in the United States and serve millions of consumers, businesses, investors, and communities throughout the country. The Forum promotes policies that support savings and investment, deep and liquid capital markets, a competitive global marketplace and a sound financial system.
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 provide responses to certain questions posed by the OCC throughout our letter, as indicated. Our key observations and recommendations are as follows:  We welcome the guidance. The Forum recognizes the emerging risks to banks presented by climate change and the importance of having robust capabilities to manage banks’ exposures to such risks. Indeed, our member institutions already have taken steps to incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks. The Proposal is helpful for understanding the OCC’s particular areas of focus with respect to the management of climate-related financial risks, and we welcome OCC guidance in this area as our member institutions work on strengthening and refining their climate-related financial risk management processes over time.  Support for scenario analysis rather than traditional stress testing. The Forum supports the use of scenario analysis, which can provide insights into a range of tailored scenarios. Scenario analysis should focus on material exposures and incorporate plausible scenarios, particularly with respect to transition risk. We also appreciate the distinction the Proposal makes between scenario analysis and traditional stress testing, which could result in adverse regulatory consequences, as gaps in data availability and methodology make regulatory consequences inappropriate.  Support for principles and risk-based, flexible approach. The Forum supports high-level principles that enable banks to have flexibility to incorporate climate- related financial risks into their existing risk management frameworks and processes where appropriate. In addition, we support a risk-based approach that considers the unique characteristics of each bank and allows banks to focus on targeting material climate-related financial risks. Given the evolving nature of the risks, data and tools, we also urge the OCC to adopt a “phased approach” so that banks have sufficient time to meet supervisory expectations, in particular relating to incorporation of and reliance on quantitative metrics. 1. We support the Proposal’s endorsement of scenario analysis, in particular, rather than regulatory stress testing, to assess and manage climate-related financial risks. a. Scenario analysis is the preferred method of evaluating climate-related financial risks. The Proposal recommends scenario analysis as an “important approach for identifying, measuring, and managing climate-related risks.” In doing so, the Proposal explicitly distinguishes scenario analysis from “traditional stress testing exercises that typically assess the potential impacts of transitory shocks to near-term economic and financial conditions.” We agree that scenario analysis is more appropriate than traditional stress 2
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 testing, and this approach is consistent with the approaches supported by other U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board (“Federal Reserve”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Committee (“FSOC”). Scenario analysis is a much more suitable tool to evaluate the potential economic and financial risks posed by different climate outcomes. A key difference between stress testing and scenario analysis is that traditional stress testing may be associated with regulatory requirements,2 with respect to which the failure to comply can result in supervisory consequences and limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.3 As discussed in greater detail below, banks face significant challenges in identifying and measuring climate-related financial risks, particularly around data. Given the gaps in currently available data, models and methods used to assess climate-related financial risks, it would be inappropriate for banks to experience adverse regulatory consequences as a result of quantitative assessments that rely on currently available data and methodologies. In contrast, scenario analysis does not necessarily result in direct regulatory consequences and “may contemplate much longer time horizons in order to assess medium- and long- term business model resilience against the changes in climate-related risks that may materialize over such longer horizons.”4 Stress testing necessarily tends to focus on shorter time horizons5 and would be unable to account for the fact that climate-related financial risks could “evolve over various time horizons,” including “those that extend beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning horizon,” as noted in the Proposal’s “Governance” principle. Therefore, a tool like scenario analysis, which can explore a range of potential scenarios over long-term horizons, would be better suited as a more flexible risk management tool for guarding against climate-related financial risks. 2 See, e.g., Financial Stability Oversight Council, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, at 90 (Oct. 2021) [hereinafter, “FSOC Report”]; Jerome Powell Remarks, Green Swan Conference, hosted by the Bank for International Settlements (Jun. 4, 2021) [hereinafter, “Powell Remarks”] (stating that scenario analysis is “not meant to be setting up a regulatory consequence, which obviously does flow from our regulatory stress tests”). 3 12 C.F.R. 217.11(c)(1). 4 FSOC Report, supra note 2; see also Lael Brainard, “Financial Stability Implications of Climate Change” (Mar. 23, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210323a.htm [hereinafter, “Brainard Remarks”]. 5 See, e.g., FSOC Report, supra note 2 (noting that “stress tests within the remit of regulators tend to focus on a shorter time horizon in order to determine the solvency and liquidity of an institution given an ‘extreme but plausible’ market risk or set of macroeconomic shocks”); 12 C.F.R. 225.8(d)(16) (defining “planning horizon” for capital planning purposes to include a period of at least nine consecutive quarters); 12 C.F.R. 252.35(a)(4) (requiring liquidity stress testing to be conducted using overnight, 30-day, 90-day and one-year planning horizons). 3
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 Lastly, the Federal Reserve has itself distinguished between scenario analysis and stress testing6 and is currently developing a program of climate-related scenario analysis.7 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in his re-nomination hearing reiterated support for scenario analysis rather than traditional stress tests: “I think it’s very likely that climate stress scenarios, as we like to call them, will be a key tool going forward. I would stress that those are very different from the regular stress tests which affect capital.”8 Governor Lael Brainard reiterated that she is not currently advocating including climate-related financial risks in traditional stress tests during her nomination hearing: “I certainly have not stated that we should do climate stress tests.”9 The FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (the “FSOC Report”) also strongly recommended that member agencies use scenario analysis, but stopped short of recommending climate stress testing akin to the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests or the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) program.10 b. Response to questions regarding scenario analysis.11 The OCC has asked for feedback on how banks currently use climate scenario analysis and which factors would be most salient to consider when designing these exercises in the future. We highlight some observations and challenges about climate scenario analysis based on the experience of our member institutions and recommend certain features of scenario analysis that the OCC should support in its final guidance. i. Observations and challenges.  Forum member institution practices. Forum member institutions already engage in climate scenario analysis as part of their broader risk management program to measure, monitor and assess their exposure to climate-related financial risks. These analyses are focused on identifying and sizing climate- 6 See, e.g., Powell Remarks, supra note 2; Brainard Remarks, supra note 4. 7 See, e.g., Federal Reserve, Financial Stability Report, at 63 (Nov. 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20211108.pdf. 8 Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Nomination Hearing (Jan. 11, 2022). 9 Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Nomination Hearing (Jan. 13, 2022). 10 FSOC Report, supra note 2, at 90 (“Scenario analysis is similar to, but distinct from, stress testing as deployed by financial regulators, such as the supervisory Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests of the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and FDIC and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) performed by the Federal Reserve Board on the largest banking organizations.”). 11 This section is responsive to Questions 12 and 13 posed by the OCC, respectively: “Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face?” and “What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises?” 4
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 related financial risks in their asset portfolios so that these risks can be monitored and managed on an ongoing basis. In formulating climate scenarios, our member institutions focus their scenarios on the most prominent likely exposures that would be impacted by climate change, subjecting certain asset portfolios to climate scenario analysis rather than conducting enterprise-wide scenario analysis. For example, some of our member institutions designed scenarios to examine the impacts of two short-term transition risk pathways on a sample portfolio of companies in the oil and gas value chain. One of these pathways was based on rapid electric vehicle adoption and the other was based on the adoption of a global carbon tax. Focusing on this portfolio allowed our member institutions to analyze the financial impacts of each pathway across different segments of the value chain within the oil and gas industry.  Gaps in data and modeling. As discussed in greater detail below, existing data and tools to measure and quantify climate-related financial risk—and in particular longer-term transition and physical risks—are only just emerging, and will need to undergo substantial exploration, refinement and adaptation over time. Data gaps, and uncertainty given the unprecedented nature of climate change, present a significant challenge for banks because the reliability of the scenario analysis results depends on the reliability of the underlying data. While climate-related data has improved in both quantity and quality over the past several years, there are still considerable gaps that frustrate attempts to accurately identify climate- related financial risks. In particular, our member institutions have highlighted data gaps regarding physical risks, such as the possibility that specific locations will experience extreme weather events and the geographic location of physical assets of companies. One of our member institutions conducted a scenario analysis to identify areas exposed to significant physical risks by mapping the bank’s exposures by geography and then cross-referencing these global geographies against potential hot spots for physical climate impacts. The more reliable the geographic data, the more useful such exercises will be. As another example, publicly available climate scenarios do not provide banks with the appropriate sectoral and regional granularity to directly translate scenario output into readily consumable inputs for internal risk modeling. For banks, the value of climate scenario analysis can only be fully realized when the science- based or macroeconomic output is expanded into more granular financial impacts that can be applied across a diverse set of client industries and sub-sectors. There is also a limited understanding of the Integrated Assessment Models that drive these scenarios, which makes it more challenging for banks and vendors alike to expand scenario output while staying within the bounds of the model. 5
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022  Time horizons. The long-term nature of climate change poses significant challenges for modeling climate-related financial risks, but striking the right balance between accounting for long-term climate change and doing so within an actionable framework is critical. As discussed above, financial risks are generally considered over the short to medium-term horizon and are generally assessed over one to three years. Climate scenario analysis over substantially longer horizons presents two important challenges. First, risk management decisions are not generally made with respect to lengthy time horizons. Second, the uncertainty around risks of any type grow quickly with the time horizon. Long time horizons lead to a wide range of uncertainty about the evolution of climate-related financial risks that make interpreting any findings difficult. Relatedly, it is necessary to make assumptions about how the evolution of the climate will impact economic variables, such as trade, employment and the relative performance of different economic sectors. Making such forecasts in the near-term is difficult, and understanding how the distant evolution of the climate relates to various economic indicators is all the more challenging. ii. Recommendations. We recommend the following for the OCC’s final guidance regarding scenario analysis:  Phased approach. As noted above, there are still significant data and modeling gaps that affect the reliability of scenario analysis results. Accordingly, as discussed further below, we support a phased approach to climate risk management, including for climate scenario analysis, while data becomes more reliable, available and consistent.  Materiality thresholds should be incorporated. A risk-based approach that considers the unique characteristics of each bank and that allows banks to focus on targeting material climate-related financial risks should apply to scenario analysis as well. The OCC, for example, should permit banks to continue focusing their scenarios on the most material likely exposures that would be impacted by climate change, and subjecting only certain asset portfolios to climate scenario analysis.  Banks should have flexibility in designing scenarios. Although we would appreciate high-level guidance on scenario analysis from regulators, we also recommend that the OCC give banks flexibility in the design of their scenarios. This approach will ensure that the broad frame of the scenario is articulated comprehensively while allowing individual firms to tailor the scenarios to the specific needs of their asset portfolios. For example, one of our member institution’s subsidiaries applied transition and physical risk methodologies to the commercial real estate and agriculture sectors. The subsidiary chose these two 6
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 climate-vulnerable sectors because of its exposure—the two sectors together comprised nearly a quarter of the subsidiary’s commercial banking lending portfolio. The flexibility to design its own scenario allowed the subsidiary to make choices based on its unique exposure that were both plausible and severe.  Scenarios encompassing transition risks should be plausible. Scenarios used for scenario analysis may be severe and rigorous but should also be credible. Scenarios keyed to tail risks that are too remote may result in risk measurements that are not highly relevant. Overall, the degree of severity in any climate scenario must be appropriately balanced against its plausibility. This balance should be made explicit in a well-articulated and measurable standard that should be employed to help ensure that climate scenarios, and in particular transition risks, are empirically relevant and have the potential to result in actionable outcomes. Transition risk may be even harder to predict than physical risk because it depends on the path of government policy. Moreover, different assumptions about the specific type and trajectory of policy can lead to significantly different outcomes. As an example, a transition risk scenario that considers the rapid imposition of a large and widely applicable carbon tax would have a significantly different impact than a transition risk scenario that is focused more narrowly on policies targeting the fossil fuel industry. OCC guidance should provide clear, high-level guidance on the nature and extent of transition risk scenarios to be considered, and these scenarios should be plausible. 2. We support the Proposal’s flexibility in permitting climate-related financial risks to be incorporated into existing risk management frameworks. a. Climate-related financial risk may be effectively addressed within existing risk management frameworks, which already sufficiently account for climate-related financial risks.12 Climate-related financial risk may be considered a transverse, cross-cutting risk in some instances or a standalone risk in others. As a result, in some circumstances it may be more appropriate for banks to embed climate-related financial risks into existing risk management frameworks and in others to create new, standalone frameworks. The Proposal appears to permit the approach of incorporating climate-related financial risks into existing frameworks and systems where appropriate, and we believe the final guidance should retain this flexible perspective. 12 This section is, in part, responsive to Questions 4 and 7 posed by the OCC, respectively: “What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks?” and “What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies—for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments—do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks?” 7
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 In the Proposal, the OCC explains that the draft principles are “consistent with the existing risk management framework described in existing OCC rules and guidance” and are intended to “help bank management make progress toward … incorporating climate- related financial risks into banks’ risk management frameworks” (emphasis added). The “Governance” principle explicitly contemplates that “[r]esponsibility and accountability may be integrated within existing organizational structures.” As the Proposal acknowledges, the OCC’s existing risk management and corporate governance standards applicable to large U.S. banking organizations are sufficiently broad and flexible to accommodate climate-related financial risks as an integrated component. For example, the OCC safety and soundness regulations require large banks to update their risk governance frameworks “at least annually, and as often as needed to address … changes in the [] bank’s risk profile caused by emerging risks.”13 OCC regulations and standards also address many of the specific risk management and internal control elements promoted in the Proposal, including without limitation for board and senior management oversight, risk appetite framework, risk data aggregation and reporting and internal controls.14 Large U.S. banks are already expected to consider their material risks in capital planning, strategy development, credit portfolio management and liquidity management, as well as the impact of material and emerging risks on other risk categories, including liquidity, credit, market, strategic, operational and model risk.15 13 OCC Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches; Integration of Regulations, 79 Fed.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 U.S. GSIBs, therefore, already have in place robust risk management frameworks and practices that are designed to address material risks and are purposefully flexible to enable the incorporation of responses to new and emerging risks. In fact, as would be the case for any other material risk, our member institutions already have been incorporating climate-related financial risk analysis into their risk management practices.16 Our member institutions have worked to incorporate oversight of climate-related financial risk into their existing governance structures by, in some instances, establishing internal committees that consist of senior executives with specific purview over climate- related financial risk management. For example, one of our member institutions has established a climate risk team that is responsible for developing the bank’s internal approach to managing climate-related financial risk, with the goal of integrating climate considerations into existing risk management frameworks. Forum member institutions employ a variety of effective strategies to mitigate climate- related financial risks and already generally prioritize risk management of assets and clients in industries considered to be higher risk or high-carbon intensity. For example, to address idiosyncratic flood risk, our member institutions generally have policies in place to require flood insurance when underwriting a mortgage if the location of the property is in a flood plain. Some of our member institutions are also taking into consideration the client’s intended use of financing, geographic locations of operations and ability to manage potential physical risk impacts. Further, some of our member institutions incorporate climate-related financial risks into overall credit assessment and underwriting processes for certain industries and loans, like commercial real estate and mortgages. In addition, we do not believe that a new type of regulatory or other external reporting specifically directed at climate-related financial risk by banks is appropriate or necessary at this point in time.17 Existing regulatory reporting, such as that required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), already incorporates disclosure of material risks, and we believe that additional reporting would be duplicative and unnecessary.18 We note that many banks are already engaged in voluntary reporting 16 We also note that, to some extent, banks have historically been successfully managing climate-related risks in conducting their activities. See, e.g., Kristian S. Blickle et al., Federal Reserve Bank of New York, How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks?, at 3 (Nov. 2021) [hereinafter, “NY Fed Staff Report”] (discussing that “long run sea level rise may have already been priced into coastal properties” and that “counties more exposed to sea level risk pay higher underwriting fees for bonds”). 17 This is responsive to Question 11 posed by the OCC: “How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?” 18 See SEC, Commission Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change (Feb. 8, 2010), https://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/2010/33-9106.pdf (explaining how items of Regulation S-K can capture a number of climate-related financial risks). 9
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 efforts through the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) as well as other industry-led reporting frameworks.19 In short, the final guidance should retain the Proposal’s approach of allowing banks the flexibility to treat climate-related financial risk as a risk that may be integrated into banks’ existing risk management frameworks and reporting. This not only would be consistent with regulatory expectations that banks’ risk management frameworks encompass all material risks to the bank,20 but also would enable banks to more expeditiously address emerging climate-related financial risks. b. Time horizons should be consistent with how banks currently assess and mitigate risk.21 The specific time horizon considered relevant for climate-related financial risks depends on the specific use for which the analysis is employed. A bank’s risk management and stress testing time horizons generally are relatively short-term (e.g., less than three years and often far shorter), in order to facilitate meaningful and realistic risk appetite and business strategy planning. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) explains that traditional financial risk scenario analysis and stress testing use shorter time frames because the uncertainty of the results increases with the timespan, as more assumptions are required.22 As the Proposal’s Governance principle states, climate-related financial risks could “evolve over various time horizons,” including “those that extend beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning horizon.” Although we agree climate change is a long-term phenomenon, expectations around climate-related financial risk management should seek a balance between the uncertain long-term effects of climate change and the need for bank management to address the more immediate impacts in an effective manner consistent with risk appetite and business planning. For example, a 30-year time horizon would be inconsistent with the risk management frameworks used by our member institutions. 19 See TCFD, Core Recommendations, https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/recommendations/#core- recommendations; Carbon Disclosure Project, Climate Change 2021 Questionnaire (Jan. 2021), https://guidance.cdp.net/en/guidance?cid=18&ctype=theme&idtype=ThemeID&incchild=1&microsit e=0&otype=Questionnaire&tags=TAG-13071%2CTAG-605%2CTAG-600. 20 See, e.g., OCC Heightened Standards, supra note 13. 21 This section is, in part, responsive to Question 6 posed by the OCC: “What time horizons do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?” 22 See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-Related Financial Risks – Measurement Methodologies (Apr. 2021), at 20–21, https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d518.pdf; Federal Reserve, The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Design and Implementation (Apr. 24, 2009), at 3, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20090424a1.pdf. 10
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 We recognize that scenario analyses may be conducted over longer time horizons, as discussed above, but the time horizons used in overall climate-related financial risk management frameworks should be consistent with current approaches to risk management in order to facilitate incorporating climate-related financial risks into existing practices. Accordingly, we recommend that the final guidance give banks flexibility to determine the appropriate time horizon depending on the purpose of the analysis. 3. We support the principles and risk-based framework discussed in the Proposal and believe the final guidance should reflect this framework and allow banks to focus on climate-related financial risks that are material to them. In the introduction to the Proposal, the OCC explains that the draft principles are intended to provide a “high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks” and to support banks’ efforts “to focus on key aspects of climate risk management” (emphasis added). The OCC also notes that, “[i]n keeping with the OCC’s risk-based approach to supervision, the OCC intends to appropriately tailor any resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.” The “Scenario Analysis” principle also advises that management develop and implement scenario analysis frameworks “in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile.” We support the use of these risk-based principles to support banks’ efforts to manage and mitigate climate-related financial risks. A risk-based framework will enable firms to tailor the incorporation of climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks based on a particular firm’s size, as well as the unique nature, scale and complexity of its activities and business. For example, we recognize that size and complexity of banking organizations can be correlated with their potential to pose systemic risk. For this reason, U.S. GSIBs are taking climate-related financial risks very seriously and already have taken certain steps to account for such risks in their governance and risk management frameworks. That said, there may be instances in which larger banks are less vulnerable to losses resulting from climate disaster. Notably, a recent staff report released by Federal Reserve Bank of New York economists (“NY Fed Staff Report”) revealed that, in the case of extreme weather events over the last quarter century, “losses at larger (multi-county) banks [were] barely affected and their income increase[d] significantly with exposure,” whereas local banks, which do not benefit from diversification across multiple geographies, experienced more negative stability effects from extreme disasters.23 23 NY Fed Staff Report, supra note 16, at 1. 11
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 The flexibility that would be provided by a principles and risk-based framework would allow each firm to focus on aspects of climate-related financial risks that are material to the particular firm and avoid diverting resources to aspects that present less risk based on the unique characteristics and activities of the firm. For example, certain financial instruments may not generate material climate-related financial risk, such as short-term liquid financial instruments for which pricing and value at risk metrics already capture the risk. While our member institutions will certainly be monitoring for all categories of risks and adjusting their internal controls as appropriate, focusing on the key material risks within key affected business lines will allow our member institutions to manage their exposure to climate-related financial risks in a manner that is most targeted and efficient. It is important that Forum member institutions be allowed to leverage existing risk management practices and capabilities in assessing the materiality of an asset portfolio in relation to climate-related risk management. For example, our member institutions have identified a variety of material climate-related financial risks based on their distinct portfolios and exposures.24 Our member institutions generally have developed a process to determine whether a risk is material that consists of: (1) identifying and assessing the potential impacts of a risk, (2) ranking the likelihood of the occurrence of the particular risk, (3) assessing and measuring the risk and (4) then making decisions based on that assessment. The material risks identified through this process inform the bank’s scenario design and analysis, risk appetite and strategic planning. Another example of a materiality determination is identifying portfolio sensitivity to climate-related financial risks through both qualitative and quantitative analyses to gauge the materiality of an asset portfolio’s sensitivity to climate change, such as rising sea levels and increased incidences of extreme weather events, like wild fires and hurricanes. This process often makes use of highly granular data, including the precise location of an asset and its relation to relevant geographic features, such as proximity to a floodplain or wildfire prone areas. These analyses are then used to build an overall assessment of a portfolio’s sensitivity to climate-related financial risks, which is then used to determine if more intensive and granular scenario analysis would be warranted from a risk measurement and management perspective. 4. The final guidance should adopt a phased approach to requiring banks to incorporate certain practices into their risk management frameworks. For reasons discussed below, we believe the process for meeting supervisory expectations regarding climate-related financial risks should be an iterative process. 24 This paragraph is, in part, responsive to Question 5 posed by the OCC: “How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?” 12
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 First, we note that this specific guidance on climate-related financial risks is new, although it draws from existing, more general guidelines. Accordingly, an appropriate timeframe will be required for banks to fully incorporate the practices discussed in the Proposal into their risk management frameworks and systems. Second, banks face a number of challenges in addressing climate-related financial risks, including the following:  Limitations on data, in particular, data “connecting the science of climate change to financial risk assessments and real-world economic impacts”;25  The relatively new and evolving nature of models and methods employed for climate scenario analysis relative to those used in traditional financial stress testing, which may not currently be suitable for rigorously assessing granular climate-related financial risks;  Uncertainty about the time horizons over which certain risks (e.g., transition risks, longer-term risks) may manifest;26 and  The non-linear and complex nature of the impacts of climate change, which make it difficult to forecast the frequency and intensity of severe climate events and assess the interlinkages between climate-related pathways and economic and financial variables across the financial system.27 The FSOC Report included a lengthy discussion of the challenges associated with identifying and mitigating climate-related financial risks, particularly around data. The FSOC Report stated that “enhancing the availability of and access to relevant, comprehensive data and developing methods and metrics to effectively utilize climate- related data and financial data” are “[n]ecessary steps for measuring and assessing climate-related financial risk.”28 These challenges, as well as the evolving nature of climate-related financial risks, necessitate an ongoing process for managing such risks. The Proposal in fact states that “[t]he OCC recognizes that the incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time.”29 Guidance 25 FSOC Report, supra note 2, at 23. These challenges are discussed in the FSOC Report as examples of challenges that regulators face, but we believe they are also applicable to banks. 26 Id. 27 Id. 28 Id. at 47. 29 Proposal, “Strategic Planning” principle. 13
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 should take into account the limitations around currently available data and metrics when setting expectations for banks. To account for the time required for, and the challenges associated with, integrating climate-related financial risks into banks’ risk management practices, we recommend that the OCC adopt an iterative or “phased approach.” This would involve the OCC phasing in certain expectations as the data and tools become more reliable and in recognition that banks will require transition periods to address emerging climate-related financial risks. In particular, we strongly recommend that the final guidance explicitly recognize that some expectations outlined in the principles cannot be executed based on quantitative rather than qualitative metrics until banks have sufficient time to develop capabilities and data and measurement tools have advanced to the degree that they can be sufficiently relied upon to serve as a basis for a number of the expectations specified in the guidelines. For example, it would not currently be appropriate to incorporate climate- related financial risks into capital and liquidity planning processes. It is important that there be sufficient flexibility in climate modeling standards so that learning and innovation can occur on an ongoing basis. A phased approach that clearly sets out gradual milestones for certain expectations would best reflect the evolving nature of climate-related financial risks and support banks’ efforts to manage climate-related financial risks in a manner that is effective, accurate and methodical. 5. Certain of the principles should be clarified in the final guidance. We recommend that certain of the principles be clarified further in the final guidance. a. Governance. For the “Governance” principle, the OCC should distinguish the roles and responsibilities of bank boards and management with respect to risk management. We believe the final guidance should explicitly align with other OCC guidance on bank boards’ responsibilities, including the OCC’s Director’s Book, which explains that the “board’s role in the governance of the bank is clearly distinct from management’s role. The board is responsible for the overall direction and oversight of the bank—but is not responsible for managing the bank day-to-day. The board should oversee and hold management accountable for meeting strategic objectives within the bank’s risk appetite.”30 The Proposal states: “The board should actively oversee the bank’s risk-taking activities and hold management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.” This expectation appears in the OCC’s Heightened Standards, which state that boards can fulfill their responsibility to oversee risk-taking activities by “relying on assessments and 30 OCC, Director’s Book: Role of Directors for National Banks and Federal Savings Associations (Nov. 2020), at 14–15, https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/banker- education/files/directors-book.html. 14
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 reports prepared by independent risk management and internal audit.”31 The final guidance should clarify that it does not augment the board’s responsibility to oversee management under existing guidance. We recommend that, to align the expectation more closely with the Heightened Standards, the “Governance” principle clarify that a board should actively oversee a bank’s risk taking activities, including by “relying on assessments and reports prepared by independent risk management and internal audit.”32 b. Public communication. For the “Strategic Planning” principle, the OCC should clarify the language regarding public communication of climate-related strategies. The Proposal calls for banks to “ensure that any public statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements.”33 Specifically, we believe it would be more appropriate for each bank to ensure that public communication of its climate-related strategies is consistent with the actions the bank is actually taking. This focus on accuracy aligns with the U.S. securities disclosure regime, which requires accuracy in public statements. We believe the current wording of this expectation would benefit from clarification by stating that the OCC’s focus in this area is having banks avoid making materially inaccurate or untrue public statements regarding climate-related financial risk plans, strategies or actions. We also believe the responsibilities of the board and management with respect to public communications regarding climate-related strategies could benefit from clarification. The Proposal calls for both boards and management to “ensure” consistency between public communications and internal strategies regarding climate-related strategies. As boards do not review a bank’s public communications except in extraordinary circumstances, we recommend that the final guidance not assign the board responsibility for ensuring alignment between public communications and internal climate-related strategies. We believe this modification would align the final guidance more closely with the roles of the board and management contemplated in OCC supervisory guidance, which, as discussed above, emphasizes that boards are not responsible for managing the day-to-day affairs of banks, but rather are responsible for overseeing and holding management accountable for operating the bank in a safe and sound manner.34 31 See OCC Heightened Standards, supra note 13, at 54537. 32 Id. 33 Proposal, “Strategic Planning” principle. 34 See OCC Heightened Standards, supra note 13, at 54537. 15
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency February 14, 2022 6. Regulatory agencies should cooperate so that there is one consistent set of high-level standards applicable across an entire banking organization. Banking organizations benefit from a consistent set of guidelines from banking regulators. We also reiterate our support for guidance, like the Proposal, that is principles-based and high-level. In the press release announcing the Proposal, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu indicated plans to “work[] with [the OCC’s] interagency peers” to develop future guidance.35 The Federal Reserve also stated that it will review the comments submitted in response to the Proposal as part of interagency coordination relating to climate-related risk, noting that “[a] consistent approach across bank regulatory agencies will best support the effective management of these risks.”36 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has said it will prioritize addressing financial risks posed by climate change in 2022, which will include seeking comment on forthcoming guidance.37 We agree that the federal banking agencies should take a consistent and coordinated approach to high-level guidance relating to risk management frameworks for climate-related financial risk. * * * Thank you for considering these comments.

February 14, 2022 VIA ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION Chief Counsel’s Office Attention: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th Street, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Ladies and Gentlemen: On behalf of its members, the Risk Management Association’s Climate Risk Consortium (“RMA Consortium”) thanks the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) for the opportunity to comment on its proposed principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks (“Proposal”). Launched in September 2021, the RMA Consortium seeks to assist banks in integrating climate risk management throughout their operations, preparing the industry to help economies transition to a low-carbon future. The RMA Consortium, representing 25 leading U.S. and Canadian banking organizations, also aims to advance climate risk management practices in the banking industry by facilitating the development of industry-wide taxonomy and standards. Before responding to the Proposal, however, the RMA Consortium wishes to express its appreciation for the OCC’s efforts to assist banking organizations under its oversight in developing climate-related financial risk management practices. Our member institutions welcome the OCC’s engagement with banking organizations as the agency develops its approach to climate-related financial risk, including by soliciting information on banks’ evolving approaches to climate change-related risk management and efforts to improve the necessary methodologies, models and data. As to the Proposal, the RMA Consortium broadly supports its principles-based approach, preference for scenario analysis over traditional regulatory stress testing, recognition of current data, modeling and methodological challenges for banks and general alignment with previous risk management guidance issued by the OCC.

appreciates the OCC’s intention to “tailor any resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models” and distinguish the roles and responsibilities of boards of directors from those of management. Nonetheless, our members believe the final guidance should include the following important clarifications, which we summarize below and then explain in greater detail throughout the letter. In sum, we recommend the final guidance: 1. Define a compliance approach that accounts for the time banks will require to implement the climate-related financial risk management processes outlined in the guidance and incorporate climate-related financial risks into decision-making processes; 2. Support more explicitly banks’ use of a risk-based approach in implementing the principles so that banks’ climate-related financial risk management practices are proportionate to the extent of their exposures, consistent with how banks treat other risk exposures; 3. Acknowledge that, at present, banks may determine it appropriate to prioritize assessing potential climate-related financial risk impacts over the time horizons banks use in strategic planning and related assessment processes and that, once assessment capabilities mature, consistency in the time horizons used by banks may be beneficial by facilitating industry benchmarking; 4. Align with other U.S. bank regulators’ approaches to climate scenario analysis so that banking organizations subject to supervision by multiple banking regulators are subject to consistent requirements; 5. Clarify that board of director responsibilities are consistent with previous OCC guidance regarding risk management; 6. Clarify the OCC’s expectations with respect to (a) banks’ consideration of climate-related financial risk impacts on low-to-moderate income (“LMI”) and other disadvantaged households and communities and (b) public communications regarding banks’ climate-related strategies; and 7. Harmonize with bank regulatory frameworks for climate-related financial risk management in foreign jurisdictions. We believe these modifications are consistent with the OCC’s objectives and the Proposal. The final guidance will be a significant milestone in the establishment of a U.S. bank regulatory framework for climate risk, making these clarifications all the more important. The requested changes will help the final guidance achieve the OCC’s 2 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
objective to support the “efforts by banks to focus on key aspects of climate risk management.” I. The final guidance should define a compliance approach that accounts for the time banks will require to implement the climate-related financial risk management processes outlined in the guidance and incorporate climate- related financial risks into decision-making processes. A. Observations and Considerations As a general matter, “developing and implementing processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control climate-related financial risk exposures within [a bank’s] existing risk management framework” will require a reasonable time period to complete in a safe and sound manner. Implementation of the guidance will require, among other things, modifications to or development of new systems, technology, models, processes, policies and governance structures. As best practices for climate risk management continue to evolve, banks and supervisors will need to collaborate to define those practices. Moreover, challenges exist in developing effective climate-related financial risk management practices, such as those outlined in the Proposal, due to issues of data, models and methodologies. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (“FSOC Report”) describes several of these challenges, including:  Limitations on data, in particular, data “connecting the science of climate change to financial risk assessments and real-world economic impacts”;1  Uncertainty about the time horizons over which certain risks (e.g., transition risks, longer-term risks) may manifest;2 and  The non-linear and complex nature of the impacts of climate change, which make it difficult to forecast the frequency and intensity of severe climate events and assess the interlinkages between climate-related pathways and economic and financial variables across the financial system.3 The FSOC Report also recognizes that better data and improved methods are essential prerequisites for the ability to measure and assess climate-related financial risk, stating: “enhancing the availability of and access to relevant, comprehensive data and developing 1 Financial Stability Oversight Council, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, at 23 (Oct. 2021) [hereinafter, “FSOC Report”]. 2 Id. 3 Id. 3 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
methods and metrics to effectively utilize climate-related data and financial data” are “[n]ecessary steps for measuring and assessing climate-related financial risk.”4 Gaps in data, notes the FSOC report, render results of scenario analyses unreliable.5 Thus, banks will require a reasonable time period to enhance relevant data, models and methods so that processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control climate-related financial risk exposures are more reliable and, thus, of greater utility. The OCC is aware of these issues, stating that the “OCC recognizes that incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time.” 6 However, the Proposal also describes expectations for the identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of climate-related financial risk exposures without accounting for insufficiencies in the current methodologies, models and data upon which such processes and practices rely. B. Recommendations The final guidance should account more explicitly and comprehensively for the time banks will require to implement the processes to identify, measure, monitor and control climate-related financial risks and incorporate those risks into decision-making processes. In particular, the final guidance should:  Establish reasonable expectations for banks’ near-term climate-related financial risk management capabilities, including by supporting more explicitly banks’ use of reasonably available methods to begin identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling climate-related financial risks while continuing to develop more robust capabilities. For example, the final guidance should clarify that qualitative risk appetite statements may be more appropriate than quantitative expressions of risk appetite until quantitative methods are sufficiently reliable;  Clarify that the OCC does not expect banks’ conformance with the guidance by a particular date but, rather, that banks work in earnest toward developing and implementing their climate-related financial risk management practices and make iterative, demonstrable progress and that, at least in the near term, the OCC does 4 Id. at 47. 5 Id. at 49. (“While a large amount of potentially relevant data for climate-related physical risks currently exists, more work is needed to improve access to this data and incorporate it into financial risk assessments . . . This data is not standardized in a way that facilitates the aggregation of datasets across entities or industry sectors and may require extensive work before it is usable.”). 6 The Proposal also states that in conveying the results of climate-related scenario analysis, management should convey the “uncertainty of results.” Proposal, “Scenario Analysis” Principle. 4 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
not anticipate that gaps in a bank’s practices would result in an informal or formal enforcement action except in very unusual circumstances; and  State the OCC’s intention to assess banks’ progress in addressing climate-related financial risks and publish anonymized results to enable industry benchmarking, foster innovation and facilitate the development of best practices. II. The final guidance should support more explicitly banks’ use of a risk-based approach in implementing the principles so that banks’ climate-related financial risk management practices are proportionate to the extent of their exposures, consistent with how banks treat other risk exposures. A. Observations and Considerations Banks should employ a risk-based approach in managing climate-related financial risk and implement practices that are commensurate with the extent of their exposure, as well as their size, complexity, business activities and overall risk profile, consistent with OCC expectations for banks’ enterprise risk management and management of other significant categories of risk.7 As clients evaluate and pursue transitions to lower-carbon strategies, banks’ climate-related financial risk management strategy should enable them to support clients’ transitions while protecting the safety and soundness of the banks. The RMA Consortium appreciates that the OCC plans to “appropriately tailor any resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models,” consistent with the OCC’s approach to risk-based supervision. As a general matter, we anticipate that, ultimately, all banking organizations will be subject to supervisory expectations with respect to their climate- related financial risk management practices and embedding proportionality in those expectations will be important. As to the Proposal, aspects of it suggest banks employ a risk-based approach to address climate-related financial risk management. For example, the Proposal describes multiple practices and processes for prioritizing material climate- related financial risk rather than simply stating that banks must address all climate-related financial risks. However, the Proposal does not encourage banks to scale their climate-related financial risk management responses based on the extent of their exposures, sizes, activities or 7 See, e.g., OCC Bulletin 2013-29, Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management Guidance (advising banks to adopt “risk management processes that are commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of its third-party relationships and the bank’s organizational structures”); 12 CFR 30, app. D.II.C.1–2 (advising front line units to “[a]ssess, on an ongoing basis, the material risks associated with its activities and use such risk assessments as the basis for fulfilling its responsibilities” and directing independent risk management to “[i]dentify and communicate to the board of directors or the board’s risk committee: (i) Material risks and significant instances where independent risk management’s assessment of risk differs from the Chief Executive Officer.”) 5 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
other factors. In contrast the OCC’s Heightened Standards promotes proportionality expressly, advising a bank to design a risk governance framework that is “commensurate with the size, complexity, and risk profile of the covered bank ….”8 B. Recommendations9 The final guidance expressly should adopt the concept of proportionality and further emphasize a risk-based approach to managing climate-related financial risks. Specifically, we recommend that the final guidance:  State that banks should employ a risk-based approach that considers materiality in managing climate-related financial risk, consistent with how banks determine materiality and manage other risks; and  Clarify that banks should design and implement climate-related financial risk management practices and processes that are commensurate with the extent of their exposures to climate-related financial risk, in addition to their size, complexity, business activities and overall risk profile.10 III. The final guidance should acknowledge that, at present, banks may determine it appropriate to prioritize assessing potential climate-related financial risk impacts over the time horizons banks use in strategic planning and related assessment processes and that, once assessment capabilities mature, consistency in the time horizons used by banks may be beneficial by facilitating industry benchmarking. A. Observations and Considerations The Proposal states that “[a]s part of forward-looking strategic planning, the board and management should address the potential impact of climate-related financial risk exposures on the bank’s financial condition, operations (including geographic locations), 8 12 CFR 30, app. D.II.C.2, “Role and Responsibilities of Independent Risk Management.” 9 This section is, in part, responsive to Question 3 posed by the OCC: “What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems?” 10 We recognize that size and complexity of banking organizations can be correlated with their potential to pose systemic risk. That said, there may be instances in which larger banks are less vulnerable to losses resulting from climate disaster. Notably, a recent report released by Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff revealed that, in the case of extreme weather events over the last quarter century, “losses at larger (multi-county) banks [were] barely affected and their income increase[d] significantly with exposure,” whereas local banks, which do not benefit from diversification across multiple geographies, experienced more negative stability effects from extreme disasters.

and business objectives over various time horizons.”11 The Proposal also notes that relevant time horizons for understanding “the potential ways in which these risks could evolve … may include those that extend beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning horizon.”12 The RMA Consortium appreciates the importance of banks’ exploring potential climate- related financial risk impacts over various time horizons, including time horizons that extend beyond those typically used in financial risk assessments. As the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) explains in its report on measurement methodologies for climate-related financial risks, “[c]onventional capital planning horizons have tended towards two- to three-year forecasts …, while strategic planning at banks has tended towards three- to five-year periods …. Conversely, many physical climate risks are expected to increase in materiality over a much longer horizon.”13 For example, the Heightened Standards requires large banks to develop three-year strategic plans, and the OCC’s Director’s Book advises banks to develop three to five year strategic plans.14 As the OCC explained in the preamble to the Federal Register release of the Heightened Standards, “a three-year plan is necessary for covered banks to predict changes that could affect the bank’s financial position.”15 The RMA Consortium would ask the OCC, as part of its ongoing work to develop a supervisory response to climate-related financial risks, to consider the expectation in the Proposal that, “[a]s part of forward-looking strategic planning,” a bank “should address the potential impact of climate-related financial risk exposures on the bank’s financial condition, operations … and business objectives over various time horizons,” in light of the OCC’s appropriate outstanding guidance on strategic planning horizons and the fact that climate-related financial risks can manifest over much longer time horizons. Similar to the OCC’s outstanding guidance, the Federal Reserve Board (“Federal Reserve”) requires nine-quarter projection periods for its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) program because it “believes that a firm should be able to make informed projections of its financial and capital position for a two-year calendar period.”16 The CCAR predecessor program, Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, 11 Proposal, “Strategic Planning” principle. 12 Proposal, “Governance” principle. 13 See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-Related Financial Risks – Measurement Methodologies (Apr. 2021), at 20–21, https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d518.pdf. 14 OCC, Director’s Book: Role of Directors for National Banks and Federal Savings Associations (Nov. 2020), at 14–15, https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/banker- education/files/directors-book.html. 15 See 12 CFR 30, app. D.II.D, “Strategic Plan.” 16 Annual Company-Run Stress Test Requirements for Banking Organizations With Total Consolidated Assets Over $10 Billion Other Than Covered Companies, 77 Fed. Reg. 62396, 62401 (Oct. 12, 2012). 7 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
also used a two-year time horizon. The Federal Reserve explained that this choice of time horizon reflected a tradeoff between capturing the full extent of potential changes that might be incurred in the long-term and a reasonable ability to project with some degree of confidence many changes that are likely to occur within two years.17 As the BCBS further explains, “[a]s the measurement horizon becomes further removed from the present, the assumptions about the future operating environment will become increasingly dominant as a driver of measurement outputs, leading to greater modelling uncertainty.”18 Separately, the RMA Consortium believes, over time, there are benefits to banks assessing potential climate-related financial risk impacts over the same time horizons to facilitate industry-wide benchmarking, but that it would be inappropriate for the OCC to specify the time horizons banks should consider until measurement and forecasting capabilities mature. B. Recommendations:19 We recommend the final guidance:  Retain the flexibility implicit in the Proposal for banks to explore potential climate-related financial risk impacts over various time horizons selected by banks; and  Indicate that the OCC anticipates there being benefits to its specifying time horizons banks should consider to facilitate industry-wide benchmarking and support supervisory efforts. IV. The final guidance should align with other U.S. bank regulators’ approaches to climate scenario analysis so that banking organizations subject to supervision by multiple banking regulators are subject to consistent requirements. A. Observations and Considerations Multi-tiered banking organizations benefit from a consistent set of standards and guidelines from banking regulators. We appreciate that in the press release announcing the Proposal, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu stated the OCC plans to 17 Federal Reserve, The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Design and Implementation (Apr. 24, 2009), at 3, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20090424a1.pdf. 18 See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-Related Financial Risks – Measurement Methodologies (Apr. 2021), at 20, https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d518.pdf. 19 This section is, in part, responsive to Question 6 posed by the OCC: “What time horizons do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?” 8 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
“work[] with [the OCC’s] interagency peers to develop more detailed guidance [in 2022].”20 Similarly, the Federal Reserve has said that it will review the comments submitted in response to the Proposal as part of interagency coordination relating to climate-related financial risks, noting that “[a] consistent approach across bank regulatory agencies will best support the effective management of these risks.”21 We appreciate in particular the Proposal’s alignment with other U.S. banking regulators in selecting scenario analysis rather than traditional stress testing exercises in the context of climate-related financial risks. The Federal Reserve has distinguished scenario analysis from stress testing,22 and stated that the agency currently only is developing a program on climate-related scenario analysis.23 Additionally, the FSOC Report strongly recommended that member agencies use scenario analysis, and did not recommend climate stress testing akin to the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests or the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.24 B. Recommendations25 The final guidance should:  Retain the Proposal’s focus on scenario analysis rather than traditional stress testing, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s approach and FSOC’s recommendations; and  Outline expectations for scenario analysis frameworks and exercises—including with respect to time horizons, assumptions regarding “plausible future states,” 20 OCC, News Release 2021-138: OCC Seeks Feedback on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021), https://occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news- releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138.html. 21 Rachel Koning Beals and Greg Robb, “OCC takes step toward pressure on large banks to reveal climate-change risks,” Marketwatch (Dec. 16, 2021), https://www.marketwatch.com/story/occ-takes- step-toward-pressure-on-large-banks-to-reveal-climate-change-risks-11639688971. 22 See, e.g., Jerome Powell Remarks, Green Swan Conference, hosted by the Bank for International Settlements (Jun. 4, 2021); Lael Brainard, “Financial Stability Implications of Climate Change” (Mar. 23, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210323a.htm. 23 See, e.g., Federal Reserve, Financial Stability Report, at 63 (Nov. 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20211108.pdf. 24 FSOC Report, supra note 1, at 90 (“Scenario analysis is similar to, but distinct from, stress testing as deployed by financial regulators, such as the supervisory Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests of the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and FDIC and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) performed by the Federal Reserve Board on the largest banking organizations.”). 25 This section is, in part, responsive to Question 13 posed by the OCC, “What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises?” 9 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
requirements regarding which portfolios are stressed, and use of third-party scenarios—that are consistent with those the Federal Reserve ultimately issues. V. The final guidance should clarify that board of director responsibilities are consistent with previous OCC guidance on risk governance. A. Observations and Considerations The RMA Consortium appreciates the OCC’s plan to distinguish the roles and responsibilities of the board and management with respect to climate-related financial risk oversight in the final guidance. The OCC has articulated detailed expectations for the board’s oversight of a bank’s risks and risk management in the Heightened Standards and Director’s Book.26 Aspects of the Proposal appear to draw from these sources in describing the board’s and management’s roles and responsibilities. For example, the Heightened Standards contains the same directive to the board as found in the “Governance Principle” of the Proposal that the board should “actively oversee the bank’s risk-taking activities and hold management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.”27 However, the Heightened Standards includes more detail regarding expectations for how boards are to fulfill their oversight responsibility, stating that “the board of directors may rely on assessments and reports prepared by independent risk management and internal audit to support the board’s ability to question, challenge, and when necessary, oppose recommendations and decisions made by management ….”28 The RMA Consortium notes that banks carefully review the articulation of board responsibilities in regulatory guidance in shaping their risk governance; distinctions in the descriptions of board responsibilities across guidance can introduce confusion as to whether a regulator intends to alter the board’s responsibilities. As such, the RMA Consortium believes that, as to board responsibilities, the final guidance should reference the OCC’s outstanding guidance on risk governance or articulate the responsibilities, both in wording and context, consistent with such guidance. B. Recommendations The final guidance should clarify that board of director responsibilities are consistent with previous OCC guidance. Specifically, the final guidance should: 26 See 12 CFR 30, app. D; OCC, Director’s Book: Role of Directors for National Banks and Federal Savings Associations (Nov. 2020), https://www.occ.gov/publications-and- resources/publications/banker-education/files/directors-book.html. 27 12 CFR 30, app. D.III.B, “Standards for Board of Directors, Provide Active Oversight of Management.” 28 Id. 10 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
 Clarify that it does not represent an adjustment in longstanding OCC expectations regarding the board’s role and responsibilities, including as they relate to management’s role and responsibilities; and  If stated other than through cross-reference to such guidance, the articulation of board responsibilities in the final guidance should cross-reference to or replicate to the extent appropriate the descriptions of relevant board of director responsibilities in previous guidance. VI. The final guidance clarify the OCC’s expectations with respect to (a) banks’ consideration of climate-related financial risk impacts on LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities and (b) public communications regarding banks’ climate-related strategies. A. Observations and Considerations The RMA Consortium agrees with the OCC’s statement in the Proposal that climate change could have disproportionate impacts on the financially vulnerable, including LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities and that it is important for banks to consider the implications on such stakeholders. The RMA Consortium encourages the OCC to collaborate with peer banking agencies, federal housing agencies and government sponsored enterprises to identify appropriate mechanisms for banks to employ to respond to the potential impacts to these communities. For example, banks potentially could leverage their Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) programs. As part of the planned interagency modernization of regulations implementing the CRA, it may be appropriate to enable banks to receive CRA credit for financing climate resiliency activities that revitalize or stabilize LMI and other disadvantaged communities.29 Our member institutions welcome discussion on this important issue. With respect to public statements, the Proposal calls for banks to “ensure that any public statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements.”30 We encourage the OCC to clarify the wording of the expectation regarding public statements by stating that the OCC’s focus in this area is for banks to make full and accurate disclosures regarding climate risk plans, strategies or actions. 29 In 2021, the New York Department of Financial Services incorporated such climate-based credit incentives into the New York State Community Reinvestment Act. See New York State Department of Financial Services, CRA Consideration for Activities that Contribute to Climate Mitigation and Adaptation (Feb. 9, 2021), https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20210209_cra_consideration. 30 Proposal, “Strategic Planning” Principle. 11 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
B. Recommendations The RMA Consortium encourages the OCC to clarify its expectations with respect to (a) banks’ consideration of climate-related financial risk impacts on LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities and (b) public communications regarding banks’ climate-related strategies in the following ways.  In order to effectively address disproportionate impacts, the RMA Consortium encourages the OCC to collaborate with relevant agencies to identify appropriate mechanisms for banks to employ to respond to potential climate-related financial risk impacts on LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities, including by leveraging the planned interagency modernization of regulations implementing the CRA.  The final guidance should align expectations regarding banks’ public communications with the U.S. securities disclosure regime, which requires accuracy in public statements. We further request that expectations regarding public communications and disclosures align with any future rules and guidance specifically related to climate disclosures issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission.31 VII. The final guidance should harmonize with bank regulatory frameworks for climate-related financial risk management in foreign jurisdictions. A. Observations and Considerations The RMA Consortium also appreciates the OCC’s engagement on climate-risk management with foreign banking regulators. The scope of bank supervisors’ mandates with respect to climate risk responses vary by jurisdiction, which may result unto itself in certain distinct requirements across jurisdictions. Nevertheless, consistency to the extent of consistent mandates among supervisors across jurisdictions in evaluating a bank’s incorporation of climate-related financial risk management practices would facilitate more efficient and effective compliance and climate-related financial risk management by internationally-active banks and foreign headquartered banks subject to international laws and regulations on a consolidated, enterprise-wide basis. 31 See, Acting Chair Allison Herren Lee, Public Input Welcomed on Climate Change Disclosures (March 15, 2021), https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/lee-climate-change- disclosures?source=email. 12 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103
B. Recommendations The final guidance should aim for high-level alignment internationally across jurisdictions with consistent mandates. In particular, the RMA Consortium recommends that:  The OCC should seek to coordinate among cross-jurisdictional authorities and aim for consistency in high-level industry standards across jurisdictions where appropriate with the goal of creating “interoperable” climate-related financial risk management guidance and principles. In this way, the efforts of financial institutions to create tools and process with respect to climate risk management in one jurisdiction may still be relevant and utilized to adhere to requirements in another jurisdiction. VIII. Conclusion RMA Consortium appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments and thanks the OCC for its efforts in developing guidance for banks on climate-related financial risk management practices. The RMA Consortium looks forward to continuing its engagement with the OCC on these issues. * * * Sincerely, Fran Garritt Director Risk Management Association 13 1007628784v21 Contact us & learn more at 1801 Market Street, Suite 300 www.rmahq.org Philadelphia, PA 19103","The Risk Management Association’s Climate Risk Consortium (RMA Consortium) submitted a comment on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) proposed principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. The RMA Consortium, representing 25 major U.S. and Canadian banks, supports the OCC's principles-based approach and scenario analysis preference. They appreciate the OCC's efforts to tailor supervisory expectations to banks' specific circumstances. However, they recommend several clarifications in the final guidance: defining a compliance approach that considers the time needed for implementation, supporting a risk-based approach proportional to banks' exposures, aligning with other U.S. regulators' approaches, and harmonizing with international frameworks. They also suggest clarifying board responsibilities, considering impacts on low-to-moderate income communities, and ensuring public communications align with internal strategies.

Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 Submitted electrically: www.regulations.gov Re: Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback Dear Sir or Madam: The Ohio Bankers League (OBL)1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Office of the Comptroller of Currency’s (OCC) proposed rule for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. The management and mitigation of risk is an essential component of banking that our members do every day. Generally, OBL, on behalf of our members, believe every bank takes into consideration all areas of risk before making any financial transaction. Since the business of banking began, managing risk has been a cornerstone of the industry. The business of banking is managing risk, whether that’s interest rate, credit, liquidity, reputational, cyber, or many others, banks operations are dictated by their robust risk management process. It is in that spirit we caution the OCC against creating any regulation essentially cutting off entire industries or areas due to supposed additional risk to the safety and soundness of a bank. Instead, we hope the OCC will finalize rules giving individual bank boards and management teams the ability to determine for themselves if a particular customer or project fits within their risk profile and expertise. Any regulation that could be seen as putting the industry in the middle of political or ideological issues could lead to a perception of bias against certain industries. This could in turn lead to a knee jerk response or reaction from states or localities with a differing ideological belief. In the end, the yo-yo effect that instead of reducing risk, simply adds more risk and uncertainty to the system. Most recently in some states and cities, public contracts and public funds have been weaponized to push for or against ideological ideas which the industry has no interest being in the middle of. Some of these are in direct response to previous regulatory actions which were seen as hostile to certain industries. 1 The Ohio Bankers League [“OBL”] is a non-profit trade association that represents the interests of Ohio’s commercial banks, savings banks, savings associations as well as their holding companies and affiliated organizations. OBL has over 170 members which represents the overwhelming majority of all FDIC-insured depository institutions doing business in this state. OBL membership represents the full spectrum of FDIC=insured depository institutions from small mutual savings associations owned by their depositors, community banks that are the quintessential locally owned and operated businesses, up to large regional and multistate holding companies that have several bank and non-bank affiliates and conduct business from coast to coast.

Banks should be free to lend to invest in, and generally do business with any entity or activity that is legal, without government interference. Further, banks should be able to choose not to engage in lending, investing or other activity, so long as they do not violate fair lending or other anti- discrimination laws. In essence, banks should be able to continue to do their due diligence and manage risk without regulatory or legislative pressure for or against certain industries. There are numerous reasons why a bank may choose to do business or not do business with a particular company or a particular industry. Banks need the flexibility to operate pursuant to federal and state laws and regulations, and to manage all forms of risk in a safe and prudent manner. The OCC argued that point itself when the agency finalized OCC 12 CFR Part 55. The OCC released in a statement the rule codified more than a decade of OCC guidance stating that banks should conduct risk assessments of individual customers, rather than make broad-based decisions affecting whole categories or classes of customers, when providing access to services, capital, and credit.2 Conclusion The members of the OBL agree that decisions on individual customers should be up to the risk assessment of that customer. We urge the OCC to focus on actual risk management when crafting this rule instead of making regulation cutting off whole classes of customers or industries. We appreciate the opportunity to provide input on this important issue.

kzn-42bf-n7sz,"February 14, 2022 By electronic submission Chief Counsel's Office Attention: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 Ladies and Gentlemen: The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. and Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (collectively, the “Associations”)1 appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (the “OCC”) request for feedback on the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (“Principles”) released on December 16, 2021.2 The Associations support the OCC’s goal to enhance the safe and sound management of banks’ exposures to climate-related financial risks. Given the intensifying pace of climate change, it is important to have a continuous dialogue with banking regulators to develop and determine the best approach to the treatment of climate-related financial risks. We welcome the OCC’s principles-based approach to addressing risk management practices related to climate risk. We support the OCC’s efforts to establish regulatory principles and guidance surrounding new and emerging climate-related financial risks that align with the existing risk management regulatory framework. We believe that climate-related financial risks are drivers of existing risks. Accordingly, banks are at a developmental stage in embedding these risks into their existing risk management frameworks. Currently, our member banks’ risk management practices, in the context of climate- related financial risk, have centered around the identification and evaluation of potential climate-related financial risks under different scenarios, specifically focusing on assessing potential materiality for different risks over different time horizons.3 These efforts have helped identify some inadequacies and challenges, including data limitations and complexities arising from a variety of different scenarios and time horizons. 1 Please see Appendix for information regarding each Association. 2 https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html 3 To-date, banks have employed various time horizons in determining climate-related risk.
However, given the various challenges our members face when conducting scenario analysis, as explained in more detail below, we believe it is currently premature to incorporate climate-related financial risks into capital and liquidity adequacy assessment. Our comments below focus on four (4) key areas that are particularly important to our members as they are an integral part of an effective risk-management framework. These include: • Data: The availability of relevant, accurate and timely data is the key impediment in quantifying climate-related financial risks into banks’ exposures. • Scenario analysis: Institutions should have flexibility to create their own model designs with the data available based on principles-based regulatory guidance. • Responsibility of the board: An effective risk-management framework should clearly distinguish and define the role and responsibility of the board relative to senior management. • Regulatory coordination: As climate-related financial risks are global in nature, regulators should use their best efforts to coordinate on a regional and international basis when establishing principles or guidance that address climate risk. Data The key challenge that banks face in incorporating climate-related financial risk into their respective risk management frameworks is the fact that existing data and tools to measure and quantify climate-related financial risk—and in particular, longer-term transition and physical risks—are only just emerging. Such data will need to undergo substantial exploration, refinement, and adaptation over time. Although data capabilities are improving, significant gaps in data sourcing, capture, standardization, and aggregation substantially affect the accuracy of projections and risk assessment. For example, there is a growing disparity between the increasing availability of transition risk data as compared to less available physical risk data. Consequently, banks’ ability to understand and analyze physical risks is still evolving. In this regard, we agree with the OCC’s view reflected in the Principles that sound risk management is significantly dependent on the availability of relevant, accurate, and timely data. We also appreciate that the Principles acknowledge that the development of bank risk management frameworks to embed climate-related financial risks is iterative and will continue to evolve alongside wider developments, such as the availability of better quality, and more specific data. Accordingly, any additional guidance published subsequent to these Principles should take a flexible approach, encouraging banks to individually consider, with the data
presently available, how climate-related financial risks impact their particular business and respective risk management frameworks. Scenario Analysis We agree with the OCC that climate-related scenario analysis is an important tool that can be used to explore the potential impacts of climate-related financial risks on banks’ portfolios and the overall business model. We recognize that such an exercise could enhance efforts to understand potential impacts, limitations, and improve our understanding of what needs to or can be done in the context of climate-related financial risk. We are supportive of the OCC’s view that firms should develop and implement climate- related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile. To-date, our members are actively engaged in developing their scenario analysis capabilities and running exercises across different parts of their portfolios. At present, banks find it difficult to capture the specific impact of a climate-related event on the trading book given the limited availability of useable data (e.g., discount curves or price curves that capture climate risk). We support further development of climate scenarios to reach a consensus on available scientific and economic forecasts and a range of scenarios, such that individual banks can then tailor their approach to reflect their bank specific business models and risk profiles. For example, the Network for Greening the Financial System, Representative Concentration Pathways, and International Energy Agency’s scenarios can be used to meet regulatory and risk management needs. Also, publicly available climate scenarios do not provide banks with the appropriate sectoral and regional granularity to directly translate scenario output into readily consumable inputs for internal risk modeling. For banks, the value of climate scenario analysis can only be fully realized when the science-based or macroeconomic output is expanded into more granular financial impacts that can be applied across a diverse set of client industries and sub-sectors. Additionally, there is still a limited understanding of the climate economic models that drive these scenarios, which makes it more challenging for banks and vendors alike to expand scenario output while staying within the bounds of the model. Given these challenges, scenario analysis should be considered an exploratory exercise, at this point in time, that enables firms to identify key areas of the business model that could be impacted by climate risk (both transition and physical) events. Conducting such exercises should also inform the firm’s modelling strategies as the industry gradually develops more sophisticated capabilities. Indeed, many of our members are participating in industry-wide initiatives developing scenario analysis frameworks and methodologies
to assess climate-related impact. In this regard, any guidance from the OCC should be principle-based and should allow institutions to have flexibility to create their own model designs with the information at-hand. Responsibility of the Board We are concerned that, as drafted, the Principles sometimes inappropriately equate the role of the board to that of the senior management, and thus, improperly assign responsibilities to both the board and senior management interchangeably. For example, the Principles recommend that the board “incorporate climate-related risks into [banks’] internal control frameworks” and “monitor how climate-related financial risks affect the bank’s exposure to risk related to changing prices.” These types of responsibilities run counter to the board’s role as an oversight body that oversees and challenges the executive management team, holding the executive to account. In this regard, we recommend that references to “monitoring” should include only management and not the board. Such responsibilities are better suited for the senior management and key staff that have access to the day-to-day information and can create and amend policies within the bank based on the available information. Blurring the lines between boards and executives could defy the purpose of strong internal governance. In addition, the Principles place a significant amount of responsibility on the board with respect to strategic direction as it relates to climate-related financial risk and fail to recognize banks’ various internal management structures. For example, the board is expected to determine the bank’s “risk appetite” in the context of climate-related financial risk, whilst this is typically the responsibility of senior management. In general, banks may assign these responsibilities in different ways. In certain cases, the board may play a more hands-on role; while in other cases, the senior management designs and crafts the banks’ strategic direction, with the board endorsing the plan and providing general oversight. We provide a few other examples where we think this distinction could be better clarified: • Governance section A materiality concept should be included in this section, as it is elsewhere o (e.g., “actively oversee the bank’s material risk taking activities”). The general statement “sound governance includes . . .” would benefit o from some delineation between board and management responsibilities. • Strategic planning section – “Boards” should not be included in references to public statements as this is beyond the scope of what the board would actually be tasked with, in particular “any” public statement.
• Credit risk section – Suggest amending the last sentence to “The board and management should determine credit risk appetite and relevant risk management metrics and lending limits related to climate risk these risks.” The Principles should also clarify that management “determines” and the board approves credit risk appetite. Accordingly, the Principles would benefit from: (1) more flexibility in acknowledging various bank structures, (2) clear differentiation between the roles of the board and senior management, and (3) recognition that, in general, a board’s responsibilities with respect to the governance are distinct from the responsibilities of the bank’s senior management. Regulatory Coordination Given a fast-evolving landscape, the effective global coordination of prudential and supervisory principles is critical. Our members are keen on global financial regulators developing common principles of how to address climate-related financial risks across the financial system. Global regulatory coordination will support banks in embedding climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks, including across operating entities in different jurisdictions. Any final OCC document should address the need for harmonized supervisory principles, domestically and internationally. In this regard, we would welcome additional, coordinated guidance from the regulatory community in the following areas: • Consensus around scientific and economic forecasts and range of scenarios and further international coordination and collaboration on the development of climate-risk models and scenarios • Solutions to overcome a lack of relevant granular data and development of robust climate-related financial risk model frameworks; and • Collaboration between prudential and market regulators to mitigate any unintended negative impacts on capital markets, including transition finance market.
Conclusion We appreciate the opportunity to submit our comments in response to the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We commend the OCC for its consideration of these important issues. We look forward to the issuance of further guidance relating to climate-related financial risks. Our members are strongly committed to maintaining the safety and efficiency of the U.S. financial markets and recognize that banks have a big role to play in the management of climate-related financial risks. We hope that the OCC will consider our suggestions, as they reflect the extensive knowledge and experience of financial market professionals within our memberships.

Gardineer Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) 400 7th St. SW Washington, DC 20219 Re: IIF Public Comment on OCC Request for Feedback on ‘Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks’ Dear Ms. Gardineer: The Institute of International Finance (IIF) and its members, which broadly represent the global financial services industry, appreciate the opportunity to provide public comments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on its Request for Feedback on ‘Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks’ (hereafter ‘the consultation’). The IIF is the global association of the financial industry, with more than 450 members from over 70 countries, including commercial and investment banks, asset managers, insurance companies, ratings agencies, market infrastructure providers, and professional services firms. We agree with the OCC that the way banks identify, measure, monitor, and control potential climate-related financial risks could affect their safety and soundness, and the overall stability of the financial system. As such, we appreciate the OCC’s initiative to articulate a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks, and its principles-based approach to this important topic. Supervisory engagement, risk management, disclosure, and scenario analysis exercises are likely to be an effective toolkit for the banking industry to measure, manage, and take steps to mitigate climate-related risks.1 As summarized in recent analysis by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)2 and entities such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB),3 numerous jurisdictional authorities have already moved ahead to develop and implement prudential responses to climate-related risks and opportunities that face the banking, and broader financial, sector. It is encouraging that many authorities across the world are seeking to move swiftly on these extremely important and pressing topics; however, an uncoordinated and rapid proliferation of new policies—given significant uncertainties and knowledge gaps—could create a fragmented, and potentially less effective, policy landscape. Steps towards greater policy and supervisory coordination are particularly important with respect to risk management approaches of major cross-border banking institutions, many of which are currently facing a multitude of differing supervisory expectations and requirements focused on aspects of 1 IIF, “Prudential Pathways: Industry Perspectives on Supervisory and Regulatory Approaches to Climate-related and Environmental Risks,” January 2021. 2 NGFS, “Progress Report on the Guide for Supervisors,” October 2021. 3 FSB, “Stocktake of financial authorities’ experience in including physical and transition climate risks as part of their financial stability monitoring,” July 2020. 1
climate-related risks. To convey views on approaches for achieving greater coordination, the IIF has recently submitted a public comment letter to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) consultation on “Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks,” which is available here. In that letter, the IIF welcomes the development of global principles to support supervisory cooperation and collaboration. Climate risk is a global issue that warrants a coordinated and harmonized approach across jurisdictions, including in supervisory principles and standards with respect to climate risk management. As the OCC is a BCBS member and recognizing the similarities of approach between the BCBS and OCC draft principles, we appreciate the steps the OCC has taken to contribute to greater international coordination of supervisory approaches. The IIF’s detailed comments on the BCBS consultative document may also be relevant to the OCC consultation given the many similarities between the two. It would also be beneficial for the OCC to work with its domestic counterparts at the other relevant U.S. federal banking agencies to develop a streamlined, data-driven, and coherent approach to the prudential regulation and supervision of climate-related financial risks in the United States. We note that this suggestion was also made by the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in its important October 2021 report4 and acknowledge that the OCC has committed to work with its interagency peers on this topic.5 While common general principles are helpful, it is important that they are applied by supervisors in a way that is proportionate, or ‘risk-based’ as the OCC refers to its approach to supervision (page 2 of the consultation). Such an approach should be accommodating enough to recognize that a variety of practices can be appropriate to manage risk and that firms’ current risk management frameworks, which vary, can be leveraged to do so. It is important that principles addressed to banks are used and referenced by supervisors in a proportionate way, recognizing banks’ different starting positions, business models and geographical footprints as well as general risk profiles, which affect the materiality of certain climate risk drivers as sources of microprudential risk. The OCC draft principles are currently directed at national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches or agencies of foreign banking organizations (FBO) with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. As described above, a range of factors will affect the materiality of transition and physical risk drivers for a given bank. In the same vein, to apply its principles to foreign subsidiaries and branches in a proportionate way, the OCC should consider the characteristics and potential climate-related risk exposure of the local entity rather than defaulting to a certain treatment based on overall group assets. As previous work on tailoring U.S. prudential requirements for FBOs has shown, different thresholds and metrics are often needed to appropriately capture foreign banks in line with the intended spirit of the principles or rules. 4 FSOC, “Report on Climate-related Financial Risk,” October 2021. 5 E.g., OCC News Release 2021-138, “OCC Seeks Feedback on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks,” December 16, 2021. 2
IIF members agree with the OCC’s assessment that climate-related scenario analysis exercises differ from traditional stress testing exercises, and have asked the BCBS to consider making this distinction clearer in their principles. We also agree that a near-term objective of climate scenario analysis can be to assist banks in “identifying data and methodological limitations and uncertainty in climate risk management and informing the adequacy of its climate risk management framework” (page 4 of the consultation). Due to the nascent stage of climate scenario analysis as a discipline, the significant current limitations in terms of data and methodologies, and the necessary simplifying assumptions employed to feasibly undertake exercises under these conditions, firm-conducted (and supervisor- conducted) climate scenario analysis exercises should be differentiated from other prudential activities or applications. Specifically, IIF members believe that it would not be appropriate at this stage to quantitatively incorporate climate-related risks into capital or liquidity adequacy assessments since the foundations are not in place with respect to technical knowledge, conceptual foundations, data, and modelling.6 We, therefore, appreciate the generally cautious approach the OCC appears to be taking on these topics in the draft principles, although the references to assessing liquidity buffers (page 5 of the consultation) may be pre- emptive at this time. Lastly, the proposed OCC principles—as well as similar principles that have been issued by other jurisdictions and those recently proposed by the BCBS—in some respects reflect a set of ‘end-point’ expectations in terms of banks’ practices. However, it is important that near-term supervisory expectations recognize that: a) Financial institutions are working to overcome several challenges at present which influence the maturity of their approaches with respect to climate-related risk drivers—many of which the OCC acknowledges in their report. These include: securing relevant and high-quality data; choosing and developing appropriate methodologies and metrics; and integrating and mainstreaming new data and metrics into decision-making. Working within the constraints of these challenges, and working to overcome them, will require a multi-year effort as banks try to identify and assess climate-related risks and build a better understanding of how they relate to financial impacts across different risk stripes (credit, market, liquidity, etc.). b) Rapid increases in the scope and volume of regulation and supervisory expectations, which are underway in many jurisdictions, can redirect banks’ resources from internal analysis and capacity building. For example, numerous supervisory authorities are currently piloting supervisory climate scenario analysis exercises, with significant variation in terms of their objectives, methodologies, time horizons, firms, and risks in scope. Global banks may be subject to differing exercises across jurisdictions, which require significant resources to engage with, at the same time as they are working quickly to develop their capabilities to identify, measure, and mitigate climate-related financial risks. It would therefore be helpful and reasonable for supervisors to take an explicitly proportionate, phased, and incremental approach to the introduction of new 6 IIF, “Navigating Climate Headwinds: Navigating Climate Headwinds: Reference Approaches for Scenario-based Climate Risk Measurement by Banks and Supervisors,” July 2021. 3
expectations with respect to climate-related risks. In this regard, we appreciate that the OCC “recognizes that the incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time” (page 3 of the consultation). Further reflection of the developing nature of this area and the current technical challenges to certain aspects of risk management could be embedded in the OCC’s final principles. For example, recognizing that banks may start with a more qualitative approach to risk assessment until they have better data and more experience with key risk indicators and metrics, before taking steps to fully integrate risk quantification. Thank you for your consideration of these comments. On behalf of the IIF membership, we hope that these global industry perspectives will contribute to your efforts. We recognize that the OCC plans to elaborate on its principles in subsequent guidance based on feedback it has received, and consider lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions. We would be very happy to discuss any of our comments further or to assist in any way, including providing perspectives on approaches taken in other jurisdictions.

Better Markets applauds the publication of these principles as an important step in addressing climate risks, which can have serious effects on the safety and soundness of banks as well as overall financial stability. Considering the broad range of risks that climate change can pose, we welcome the OCC’s approach of largely integrating climate risks into existing risk management principles with some additions that capture unique aspects of climate risks – in particular, the use of scenario analysis to identify and size risks, the consideration of longer time horizons, and the recognition that climate risks and their management are an evolving process. We urge the OCC to finalize these principles with some enhancements as discussed below and to fully incorporate them into the supervisory assessment process. First, considering the evolving nature of climate risks and the current absence of mandated measurements or metrics, and the development of so-called best practices being in early stages, the OCC should encourage banking institutions to look to available internationally agreed-upon metrics and best 1 Better Markets is a non-profit, non-partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street, and make our financial system work for all Americans again.

practices for either direct use or use as a benchmark to their own internally developed practices. Second, the language regarding scenario analysis should similarly include promotion of banking institutions’ use of internationally agreed-upon scenarios and scientific projections to ensure plausibility and minimum severity of their own scenarios. Third, while issuing principles-based guidance is a necessary step in including climate risks in the supervisory assessment process, given actions taken in the recent past, guidance alone is unlikely to suffice to prompt banks to adopt suitable practices to address climate-related risks. Indeed, a rule proposed3 by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“the Agencies”) in 2020 and adopted by the OCC in February last year4 seriously undermined supervisors’ effectiveness by limiting the role of supervisory guidance in issuing supervisory findings and by extension informing supervisory ratings. As such, we urge the OCC to work with the other regulatory agencies to rescind this rule to better ensure that guidance can achieve its intended effect of getting banks to develop and use better practices with respect to managing the risks from climate change. The Proposed Principles Take the Appropriate Approach of Largely Integrating Climate Risks into Existing Risk Management Principles Banks themselves are the “first line” in identifying, sizing, and managing risks, and so it is necessary for banks to ensure they have strong and robust risk management and governance processes in place. It is the responsibility of prudential regulators to assess banks’ processes and hold banks accountable when they are not effective. Put another way, it is the responsibility of banks to design and execute processes that are necessary to effectively manage their risks on a day-to-day basis. The responsibility of prudential regulators is to assess risk management and governance processes at banks and to take supervisory actions to require banks to fix weaknesses in those processes that are identified through supervisors’ assessments of banks. Climate risks have been recognized in the U.S. and internationally as risks that pose a threat to the safety and soundness of banks and overall financial stability. Numerous global regulatory authorities and organizations have made this recognition – the central banks of Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and others as well as inter-agency and international bodies such as the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Bank for International Settlements, and the Financial Stability Board. As a broadly recognized and clearly material risk, climate-related risks must be a part of banks’ risk management and governance practices and assessing those must be part of the supervisory assessment processes of bank regulatory authorities. An integral part of that incorporation is including climate risks in supervisory guidance. More important still is including it in supervisors’ assessment criteria. Principles-based guidance does not explicitly outline all aspects of supervisory expectations, and so the principles themselves must be well-founded, specific enough to make the intention of the expectation clear and to promote safe and sound practices, and general enough to allow for evolution and innovation in the creation of best practices. The proposed 3 85 Fed. Reg. 70512 4 86 Fed. Reg. 9253 2
principles largely achieve this goal by integrating climate risks into the existing principles framework for the risk management and governance of more “traditional” risks, such as credit, market or operational risks and adding components to the principles to capture certain aspects that are unique to climate risks. Indeed, nearly all the proposed principles for climate risks align one-for-one with those of traditional risks. This is sensible and appropriate because climate risks are a risk to safety and soundness just as with more traditional risks and can manifest as more traditional risks. For example, changes in weather patterns could significantly decrease the output of farmland that collateralizes a loan, thereby harming the farmland’s income and its inherent value. This would have the effect of increasing both the probability of default on the loan and the loss given default. Importantly, the proposed principles appropriately focus on the governance of climate risks and the responsibility of boards of directors and senior management. Senior management is responsible for the day-to-day management of all risks to a bank and boards of directors are ultimately responsible for overseeing the risk management and governance processes and holding senior management accountable for ensuring sufficient and effective risk management and governance processes. Both parties must have sufficient knowledge and understanding of climate risks to fulfill those responsibilities. Key to the proposed principles around governance is the emphasis on a bank ensuring that their board and senior management has sufficient knowledge and understanding of climate risks and the impact on a bank’s strategic direction, business model, and risk appetite. Considering the evolving nature of climate risks and that they are likely new and less understood risks to boards and senior management, without this emphasis there may be an incentive to pass on responsibility of the management of climate risks to lower- level employees and claim ignorance. In this regard, the principles also sensibly discuss the assignment of climate-related risks by board members and senior management to specific members and committees. This specific assignment can help ensure that climate risks are being managed, the assigned parties have the necessary knowledge and understanding, and the appropriate parties can be held accountable for any issues that arise. Additionally, identified risks can be escalated more easily and efficiently and understood by each responsible party along the chain of escalation. Of course, the measurement of climate risks is appropriately a central theme throughout the principles. Measurement and analysis of risks are foundational to their identification, sizing, management, and mitigation. In the spirit of largely treating climate risks similar to other, more traditional risks, the principles reasonably promote the measurement and tracking of climate risks just as with other risks through risk management processes such as: data aggregation; qualitative or quantitative metrics or indicators to assess, monitor, and report climate-related financial risks; materiality thresholds; key risk indicators that align with their regular monitoring and escalation arrangements; and internal risk limits for the various types of material climate- related financial risks. However, the language around data and measurement should be more instructive, as discussed in more detail below. Outside of the more standard risk management principles, the OCC has made some welcome additions. The OCC recognizes the key point that risks arising from climate change are as evolving just as climate change is itself, a point that defines a major distinguishing factor of 3
climate risks and one that is the basis for the following two additions beyond existing risk management principles. First, the OCC recognizes climate risks can materialize over longer time horizons as compared to more traditional risks and that banks must consider this in their management of climate risks. This is true for both physical and transition risks. Such recognition is necessary for climate risks to be properly considered and managed and appropriately encourages banks to think about how the risks will evolve over time and plan or take current actions accordingly. Second, the OCC specifically promotes the use of scenario analysis as a critical tool for sizing and identifying climate risks. Stress testing is widely recognized as an important tool for assessing evolving risks that can take many different paths over varying time horizons. These additions will promote banks to be both nimble and forward-looking, necessary aspects of managing climate risks. Additionally, the OCC has sensibly recognized that many banks have made significant public commitments regarding modifying their business practices to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy and that these commitments should align with their internal climate risk management practices, such as internal risk limits. If there is not alignment, supervisors and the public are left to wonder if the commitments are valid and if banks are effectively managing their risk. Finally, it is important that the OCC has included the consideration of potential disproportionate impacts on low-to-moderate income and other disadvantaged households and communities. These communities do indeed experience disproportionate effects from the fallout of more traditional risks, as they did during and after the 2008 Financial Crisis. Not only could a similar impact to these communities result from climate risks but there are other impacts that could also result from climate risks, such as the closing of branches due to weather related events. Measurement is the Linchpin to Effective Risk Management, and So the Principles Should Promote of Minimum Standards Being able to measure climate-related risks and exposures is fundamental to almost all categories of principles in the proposal – capital and liquidity adequacy, the risk management process, management monitoring and reporting, and the comprehensive management of credit, market, liquidity, operational and other risks. The guidance principles appropriately discuss the risk management processes noted above: data aggregation; qualitative or quantitative metrics or indicators to assess, monitor, and report climate-related financial risks; materiality thresholds; key risk indicators that align with their regular monitoring and escalation arrangements; and internal risk limits for the various types of material climate-related financial risks. Without sufficient measurement techniques and criteria, banks will not be able to properly execute on any of these risk management processes. For example, the process of simply determining which climate risks rise to the level of being material could yield unreliable results or under-estimate the amount of material climate risks to the bank. Similarly, in the process of setting risk limits and monitoring against them, if data and measurements are unreliable, then not only would the limits be unreliable but so would the measurements against them, potentially making the entire process a worthless exercise. 4
So, while it is beneficial that the principles encourage banks to “put in place processes to ensure that the aggregated data is accurate and reliable,” when it comes to data and measurements the principles do not address the “evolving nature of climate-related risks” that is also noted in the consultation document. This evolving nature and the general absence of data collection and climate risk measurement at banks make these processes more difficult to establish and more uncertain in their execution. This should be addressed in the proposed principles by promoting the use of or comparison to climate risk measurement “best practices.” Considering the proposal is intended to support a principles-based approach to addressing climate risks, it is prudent not to be explicitly instructive as to which data to collect and which metrics to utilize. Discretion should be left to the banks so that they can collect data and design metrics and thresholds that are appropriate to the structure and risk profile of their business. The approach also allows for evolution and innovation within and among banks to create new best practices or improve upon existing practices. However, given that climate risk management is in early stages and that there are not currently any generally accepted climate risk metrics or data collection requirements, banks should not be left entirely to their own discretion, and the supervisory principles should explicitly promote the use of or comparison to some agreed-upon best practices with regard to data collection and metrics. That is, the guidance principles should state that as banks establish their risk management practices, they should be looking to international organizations such as the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures or the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change for their recommendations on data collection, climate risk measurements, and risk management as an example of best practices. In fact, many banks are already doing exactly that. All the U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks are disclosing information that is aligned with the TCFD recommendations with plans to increase the amount of such information and are registered supporters5 of the TCFD recommendations. The most recent TCFD annual report published by the FSB from October 20216 shows that over 50% of firms disclosed climate-related risks and opportunities aligned with their recommendations. But just because some banks are voluntarily utilizing international recommendations does not mean there is no need to include the promotion of their use in the principles. In fact, it is even more reason to do so. Not only will the use of or comparison to measurements from broadly available best practices be beneficial to banks, but it would also be beneficial to supervisors as well. It will help set minimum expectations for banks and promote broad-based general standards across the industry, allowing for comparison between banks and the aggregation of risks across supervised institutions. Data and risk aggregation supports the monitoring of systemic risk build-up, which is critical to examining the safety and soundness of the system as a whole and is a key component to assessing overall financial stability within a country and across countries through 5 See the full list of registered supporting institutions at https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/supporters/ 6 Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2021 Status Report (October 2021), available at https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-Status_Report.pdf 5
collaboration or international supervisory organizations. This is especially important for climate risks, which are truly global. Similarly, the Principles Regarding Scenario Analysis Lack the Promotion of Plausible Scenarios with Minimum Levels of Severity Similar to data collection and climate risk measurement, the principles leave too much discretion to banks regarding their scenario analysis. While it is positive that the principles identify scenario analysis as a key tool for banks to be using in sizing and assessing their climate risks, the principles fail to include language that promotes the use of plausible scenarios that have some minimum level of severity. Again, discretion is an important component of a bank’s internal risk management practices. For scenario analysis, it allows a bank to design scenarios that are specific and unique to their business model and risk profile and to create new scenarios that may not have been imagined by their peers or regulatory authorities. However, allowing too much discretion can lead to banks potentially ignoring certain important aspects of climate change or designing scenarios that may not be as severe as generally accepted by the scientific community. Therefore, the principles should encourage banks to benchmark their scenarios against internationally agreed-upon scenarios and scientific projections, such as those produced by the Network for Greening the Financial System or the climate projections created by the United Nations, to ensure some reasonable level of plausibility and severity. By looking to these scenarios and projections when designing their own scenarios, banks can determine a reasonable minimum level of severity. Of course, as noted banks must create scenarios that capture their unique risk profiles, but any material deviations from the benchmark scenarios that are used to capture unique risks can be explained in their summaries of scenario analyses to note why the deviations were made. This is similar to how the current stress tests are designed and conducted and should be a practice that is utilized with climate scenario analysis as well. The OCC Must Rescind the Rule Limiting the Role of Supervisory Guidance in the Supervisory Process Supervisory criticisms, and the guidance that often informs them, are valuable tools that help prevent unsafe or abusive bank conduct from ripening into outright violations of law, dangerous instability, and consumer harm. The rule proposed by the Agencies in 2020 and finalized by the OCC in February of last year has limited the role of supervisory guidance in the final stage of issuing supervisory assessments of banks for unsafe or unsound practices. It is now more difficult for bank supervisors to hold banks— including the largest banks, which can pose a direct threat to financial stability and the economic wellbeing of the public when badly managed—accountable for dangerous practices, poor management, and ineffective oversight by bank boards of directors in a principles-based supervisory approach. This applies as well to these proposed principles for climate risks. 6
As such, the OCC – along with the other regulatory agencies – must rescind the rule so that these principles, as well as all other principles that are part of supervisory guidance, would have their intended impact. Conclusion Better Markets is supportive of the OCC to fully incorporate climate risks into the supervisory assessment process. The proposed principles are a significant and positive step in doing so, and we urge the OCC to finalize these principles as soon as possible and incorporate the enhancements we discuss above.

Finally, below is copy of the letter that all 2,566 people signed in support:
Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks.
Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change—a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk.
Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:
1. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;
2. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;
3. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; and
4. Make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk, and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.
It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.

It calls for banks' climate risk management to influence supervisory ratings and acknowledges community banks' vulnerability. The letter emphasizes the need for the OCC to issue strong guidance to minimize climate risk and protect against unsafe banking practices."
kzn-4x7l-xi1x,"February 14, 2022 Chief Counsel's Office Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Re: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) Request for Feedback on ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks"" (Docket ID OCC-2021-0023) Dear Chief Counsel: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (“the Chamber”) appreciates the opportunity to share our views in response to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC” or “agency”) request for feedback on “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks” (“principles”). The Chamber has been a leader in the conversation on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) topics for nearly a decade, encouraging industries to work with investors on standards to meet investor interests and reflect the unique circumstances and contexts of industries and businesses. We continue to actively collaborate with our members and other stakeholders to promote practices, policies, and technology innovations across industry and government that address our shared climate challenges, particularly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the lowest levels possible at the pace of innovation. Having been engaged on ESG topics across all industries, the Chamber is also a ready participant in conversations about the impacts of climate change on our financial system and believe there is much common ground on these issues. While the Chamber is supportive of the overall goals of the OCC as we move toward a carbon- free economy, we also support the development of market-driven solutions to these problems. As we noted in a 2020 report, “the fundamental challenge we face today is to preserve the ability of American companies to grow, innovate, and drive prosperity
under a system of free and fair capitalism. The Chamber—through its Project Growth and Opportunity or “Project GO”—is committed to identifying practical, sustainable ways to address socio-economic challenges.”1 As a part of this effort, the Chamber, in 2019, released principles for ESG reporting that are both material and industry specific.2 As the OCC pursues acting on these principles, it is important to understand the actions of other regulators regarding climate risk. In March 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) solicited public input on the state of climate change reporting for public companies and is expected to propose a rulemaking soon that mandates a certain level of climate change reporting for all public companies listed in the United States. Other regulators around the world are also prioritizing the development and implementation of a standardized reporting regime for climate risks. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is currently accepting comments on a proposal it issued in late 2021 on climate-related financial risk for banks. As noted in this request, the OCC plans to issue forthcoming guidance on climate risk “that would distinguish roles and responsibilities of boards of directors (boards) and management, incorporate the feedback received on the principles, and consider lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions.” We applaud the OCC for its stated intention to incorporate feedback from stakeholders and urge you in any future guidance to collaborate with other regulators at home and abroad who are taking these similar steps on climate risk. Regarding the aforementioned request for public input by the SEC, the Chamber has communicated to the SEC some of the current efforts of public companies regarding voluntary climate disclosure, along with the results of a Summer 2021 survey conducted by the Chamber’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (CCMC), Nasdaq, Nareit, The Real Estate Roundtable, National Investor Relations Institute, TechNet, BIO, and Silicon Valley Leadership Group that sought to learn more about current practices and the outlook for climate change and ESG reporting from the public company perspective. The survey is intended to inform policymakers as they consider the impacts that new mandates for climate change and other ESG disclosures would have on public companies and their shareholders and can be instructive to the OCC as it 1 Restarting the Growth Engine: A Plan to Reform America’s Capital Markets, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (November 2020). ccmc_growthengine_final.pdf (uschamber.com) 2 ESG Reporting Best Practices, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Project GO (2019). https://www.projectgo.com/esg-reporting-best-practices/
pursues climate action related to banks. Notably, the survey found that over the last decade, most companies have increased the amount of climate change disclosure they provide, with 59% reporting that they are disclosing more information about climate change since the SEC issued its 2010 Commission-level guidance on climate change disclosures. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of companies reported regularly communicating with shareholders regarding the evolving risk of climate change, while nearly half (46%) have increased the level of detail in climate change reporting due to shareholder input. About 73% of companies report that the time and expenses they dedicate to meeting investor demand regarding climate change and ESG have increased over the last five years, with 37% reporting that time and expenses grew “significantly.” Companies overwhelmingly (82%) agreed with the following statement: “Companies should be afforded the flexibility to determine how ‘ESG’ issues apply to them and what material information they should be required to disclose.”3 It is also critical to point out that in any forthcoming guidance on climate- related financial risk, the OCC should not recommend moving capital away from industries or sectors that may have more environmental risk. The OCC has a responsibility to focus on the safety and soundness of national banks and federal savings associations. Directing capital away from politically disfavored industries is not just illegal; it can be dangerous for our entire economy. Indeed, such an approach would lead to wide swings in regulation as political Administrations change, undermining confidence in our banking system. We encourage the OCC to limit its focus on supporting financial institutions in their assessments of climate risks only for safety and soundness purposes. Responses to OCC Principles and Questions In the comments below, the Chamber addresses certain aspects of climate- related financial risk management for banks and answers specific questions posed in the guidance. Governance The need to understand the exposure and impact of climate-related financial risk is important, but the outline of governance in the principles is short on specific requirements and instead gives a high-level review of expectations for bank management. While the request mentions that a bank’s board and management should demonstrate “appropriate understanding of climate-related financial risk 3 Climate Change Public Company Perspective & ESG Reporting Climate Change Public Company Perspective – Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness
exposures,” it seems to be left to the OCC’s discretion to determine what is appropriate. As we have mentioned, the Chamber supports market-driven solutions, and many public companies—including banks—are already demonstrating a significant understanding of these risks.4 Institutions are also integrating climate- related policies and responsibilities throughout their organizations. Further guidance from the OCC should take into account these efforts and the deep understanding of climate risks that banks already possess. Strategic Planning The Chamber commends the OCC for recognizing that “the incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time” and for noting that “any climate-related strategies, including any relevant corporate social responsibility objectives, should align with and support the bank’s broader strategy, risk appetite, and risk management framework.” Climate-related risk is one of a host of risks, and banks must institute different strategies to prepare for each type of risk in any strategic planning. We urge that in any forthcoming guidance, the OCC not place an undue emphasis on climate-related risks over others in a bank’s overall risk strategy. Liquidity Risk The guidance directs banks to “assess whether climate-related financial risks could affect liquidity buffers and, if so, incorporate those risks into their liquidity risk management and liquidity buffers.” Banks already incorporate these risks into their risk management profile. With already stringent liquidity requirements in place for banks, the Chamber cautions the OCC against issuing any guidance that would unnecessarily burden banks with increased liquidity requirements, thus impairing banks’ ability to meet customer needs. As noted above, banks consider all forms of risk, and climate-related risk is only one of a host of risks they must weigh. Legal/Compliance Risk As with any new regulations, legal and compliance risks will increase for banks as they are required to incorporate climate risk into their overall risk profile. This will be particularly acute for banks that have instituted a massive increase in legal and 4 See for example the Chamber’s report on materiality of corporate disclosures.

U.S. Chamber of Commerce Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (2017). https://www.centerforcapitalmarkets.com/resource/essential-information- modernizing-our-corporate-disclosure-system/
compliance staff in the wake of the regulatory barrage following the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. In any forthcoming guidance, the OCC should weigh the implications of future regulatory actions on banks’ compliance efforts. Such compliance costs are regressive to the size of an institution. This is important to note as mid-size banks are important providers of financing for main street businesses. The guidelines also note that any consideration of risks by banks should include “possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity.” The Chamber notes that banks are acutely aware of the potential impacts of their risk mitigation efforts and are committed to instituting risk measures that do not disproportionately affect any particular communities, including their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and applicable fair lending laws. Below, we address specific questions posed in the OCC principles: Question 1: Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? From a national bank perspective, the Chamber does not feel that these principles should apply to other categories of banks. The choice of a $100 billion threshold already encapsulates a significant number of banks and will encompass more as banks grow organically and as the industry continues to consolidate. In any event, the Chamber urges coordination with other bank regulators to ensure that these principles are applied fairly and evenly regardless of bank category. Question 2: How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? The Chamber applauds the OCC for its intention to maintain a risk-based approach to supervision and to “appropriately tailor any resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.” In future guidance, the OCC should recognize that banks have differing risk profiles and needs based on their size and structure. We believe that appropriate tailoring should be included in any future guidance for banks related to climate risk based on size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations.
Question 3: What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Compliance issues are always among the biggest challenges in implementing new policies and procedures at any financial institution. Even when banks undertake these changes voluntarily, which many are doing, the transition costs and burdens are significant. As the OCC plans to issue future guidance on climate risk, banks would likely welcome engagement with the agency. This request for feedback, along with other public interaction with banks, will provide the OCC opportunities to better understand the challenges banks face in incorporating climate risk into their risk management systems. Question 5: How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? Banks and other financial institutions are making investments in more climate-smart, modern, resilient infrastructure to reduce overall risks over the asset life cycle. Companies that have operations or products dependent on natural resources or are geographically at risk to climate impacts are often highlighting material implications in disclosures. From a climate risk perspective, banks take into consideration the plausibility and certainty of a risk to determine materiality. Risks that meet these criteria will warrant greater attention by boards and management. If a bank determines that risks are speculative and distant, they generally will not consider them material or give them heightened scrutiny. Question 9: How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Banks are acutely aware that their risk mitigation strategies could impact communities and are focusing on building resilience as part of investments. A major strategic focus of banks is compliance with CRA. Under CRA, banks are required to consider the impact of their business decisions on low-to-moderate income (LMI) and other disadvantaged communities. Allowing banks to receive CRA credit for climate risk mitigation activity in LMI communities would be an attractive way to promote responsible climate policies and transition to cleaner investments while also furthering the investment goals of the CRA.
Question 10: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? Regarding data, the Chamber commends the OCC for its acknowledgment that “data, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at a rapid pace.” A major point of concern for Chamber members is the fact that, while data is foundational, it is currently very immature. Since collection of climate data is in its early stages, banks are still trying to determine what data needs to be collected and do not have a complete understanding of what is useful. Data will improve over time, but the Chamber requests that the OCC explicitly appreciate that current data collection practices are not at their end state. Banks have a strong desire to comply with supervisory expectations and requirements, but there is a need for phasing or an iterative process in the early stages as each bank determines what is useful. Long lead times should be permitted, and the Chamber asks that regulators provide banks latitude in any forthcoming guidance regarding data collection. Another major concerns banks have regarding data, disclosures, and reporting is the audience for the data. Banks would want to know if the information they provide will be private and only for regulators’ use, or if it will be made public. The OCC should also use any data that is collected and reported to international regulators. Coordination by these agencies is key to reducing burdens on banks to provide redundant information. This will streamline requirements for banks and help avoid duplicative, time-consuming efforts to comply with the demands of multiple regulators. Question 12: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? Banks engage in “scenario analysis,” but banks define the term in a variety of ways, and this request does not attempt to bring clarity by defining the term. In any forthcoming guidance, the Chamber requests that the OCC clarify what is meant by “scenario analysis,” as it is an ambiguous term that could encompass many different types of planning. Additionally, the Chamber asks the OCC to clarify who will be responsible for conducting scenario analysis: will the OCC be conducting the analysis, or will the responsibility fall to banks or third parties?
The Chamber does not believe that scenario analysis should be tied to capital or liquidity requirements. Scenario analysis should only be used to help understand potential risks to a bank’s balance sheet and inform its overall risk management strategy. It is important to note that the SEC is also exploring scenario analysis requirements. The SEC Chair has made reference to requiring “scenario analysis” on how a business might adapt to the range of possible physical, legal, market, and economic changes that the company could contend with in the future related to climate. As with all other aspects of this guidance, in any attempts by the OCC to implement scenario analysis, the OCC should coordinate with regulators who are pursuing similar goals to avoid duplicative regulatory requirements for banks. Question 13: What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? For any future design or execution of scenario analysis, the OCC should follow the appropriate notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). New policies related to climate-related financial risk should be made only after weighing the costs and benefits of the chosen course, with justification for new policies being made clear to affected parties and the public. Public notice and comment are a vital component of rulemaking and should guide all regulatory efforts. Clear communication with banks is important, and banks should have fair and advanced notice of their disclosure and compliance obligations. We encourage the OCC to provide fair notice, expressly communicate its expectations, and adhere to the APA. Conclusion As the OCC reviews the current landscape of climate-related risk for banks, and considers possible new guidance, it must recognize the remarkable progress that has already been achieved through market-based approaches and practices and increased communication between banks and their customers. The business community has made building climate-smart, modern, resilient infrastructure among our top priorities. Any proposals related to climate risk for banks should afford banks the flexibility to adequately adopt disclosures that are appropriate, considering a bank’s particular business, operations, and financial performance.

kzn-7yd2-qh8v,"February 14, 2022 Via Electronic Submission Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, D.C. 20219 RE: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks The American Council on Renewable Energy (“ACORE”) respectfully submits these comments in response to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”)’s request for feedback on the draft “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.” ACORE is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable energy sector through market development, policy changes and financial innovation. ACORE’s membership includes renewable energy developers, institutional investors, corporate buyers, electric power generators, retail energy providers, and other stakeholders interested in finding and implementing best practices for sustainability disclosures and climate-related financial risk assessments.1 The OCC’s draft principles take the right approach by offering a principles-based framework for how large banks manage climate risk. The OCC should coordinate with other bank regulators, both domestically and internationally, to avoid conflicting or duplicative supervisory expectations to the extent possible. By promoting a principles-based framework, coordinating with other U.S. bank regulators and considering international frameworks, we believe the OCC will be able to effectively support banks in building their capabilities to effectively manage climate-related financial risk. Our comments below are specifically targeted at the OCC’s questions on climate-related financial products or services that banks offer to clients and customers. In response to question eight, “What, if any, climate-related financial products or services – for example, ‘green bonds,’ derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account – do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose?” Large U.S. banks provided a vast majority of renewable energy tax equity in support of the U.S. renewable energy development in the past twenty years, mostly investing through banking holding companies under merchant banking authority. Banks are projected to provide a majority 1 The views expressed are those of the American Council on Renewable Energy and do not necessarily reflect the views of any individual ACORE member company. 1
of tax equity in the coming years in support of clean energy transition. Tax equity transactions generally meet the requirement as recently codified in 12 C.F.R. § 7.1025, and with the further guidance issued in OCC Bulletin 2021-15, more banks are expected to invest tax equity through their bank entities. In addition to the environmental benefits, these investments compare favorably to other banking products in risk and return profiles. OCC should further encourage such investments by designating renewable energy tax equity investments as public welfare investments, analogous to low-income housing tax credit investments, which will provide consistent regulatory capital framework for the types of ESG investments that OCC and other regulatory bodies aim to support. Many banks are offering sustainable finance and other climate-related financial products and services that can direct funding to renewable energy.2 BloombergNEF has outlined many of these options in a 2021 report; chief among them are sustainable financing product options and client services that assist in the transition to green portfolios. Banks deploy a variety of sustainable debt options across the spectrum of green bonds, green loans, social bonds, sustainability bonds, sustainability linked bonds, sustainability linked loans and transition-bonds.3 As the energy transition accelerates, banks are stepping up the issuance of these products and increasing the underwriting of sustainable debt for renewable energy firms. For example, BNP Paribas and Credit Agricole underwrote $17.7 billion and $15.1 billion in green and sustainability bonds last year, respectively. JP Morgan was the largest green and sustainability bond underwriter in 2020, with $17.7 billion issued.4 Many banks disclose impact reports on issued bonds reviewed by third-party opinion providers and may attach metrics to their sustainability-linked bonds and transition bonds, such as an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) score to increase transparency to investors. Green bonds can also be linked to specific environmental targets, such as an increase in the share of renewable energy generation and consumption to enhance their climate impact. Banks can also create ESG-related derivatives products, including renewable energy purchasing instruments such as power purchase agreements (“PPAs”), proxy revenue swaps, renewable energy certificates (“RECs”), wind index futures, renewable identification numbers (“RINs”) futures and low-carbon fuel standard futures. These efforts enhance liquidity and deployment of green investment. 2 “Transition bonds” finance projects that are considered as interim steps toward a low-carbon economy, such as the development of a gas power plant in place of coal, which may still retain climate risks.

Client services may include development of climate transition plans,5 clean technology advisory services,6 carbon trading services,7 and facilitating liquidity across environmental markets and risk management strategies.8 And finally, banks can support renewable energy sector mergers and acquisitions. ACORE supports the OCC’s efforts to articulate a framework for how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate, and appreciates the OCC’s interest in how banks are offering climate-related financial products or services to clients and customers as the energy transition accelerates.

kzn-9o62-4ido,"February 14 2022 Comment Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Acting Comptroller of the Currency Mr. Michael J. Hsu: The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) legal organization with offices in Washington DC, United States, and Geneva, Switzerland. Since 1989, CIEL has used the power of law to protect the environment, promote human rights, and ensure a just and sustainable society. We appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback on the proposed Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (“Principles”)1, which rightly identifies climate risk as a threat to banks’ safety and soundness and overall financial stability. CIEL is one of many signatories to a letter spearheaded by Public Citizen on the urgent need to address the growing threat of climate greenwashing by banks while ensuring fair lending practices to low income communities and communities of color, which are among those hardest hit by climate change. We fully support the recommendations contained in the coalition letter and present this submission to highlight further opportunities to strengthen the draft Principles around the danger of bank reliance on ineffective climate solutions and the risk of climate litigation. We also provide feedback on select questions that were presented along with the draft Principles. These Principles are an important starting point for ensuring better climate risk governance by banks, but more robust measures, including mandatory measures, are necessary to ensure the US banking sector is part of the climate solution. We urge the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to incorporate the recommendations below and in the coalition letter referenced above, and move quickly to adopt and implement the Principles as amended. 1) Climate change as a systemic risk warrants robust supervisory guidance We are extremely encouraged by the OCC’s categorization of climate risk as a threat to banks’ safety and soundness and overall financial stability. The assessment that climate change poses 1Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks[Draft](December 16 2021) 1101 15th St NW, Ste 1100, Washington, DC 20005 USA | Tel 1.202.785.8700 | Fax 1.202.785.8701 | info@ciel.org 15 rue des Savoises, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland | Tel 41-22-789-0500 | Fax 41-22-789-0739 | geneva@ciel.org www.ciel.org
a systemic risk to the financial system has been widely accepted by banks2, investors3, and regulators4 alike, and is strongly backed by empirical evidence. Through physical and transition risks, climate change has the potential to destabilize the normal functioning of the financial system and lead to serious negative consequences for the real economy. A London School of Economics study projected that unaddressed climate change resulting in warming of 2.5ºC by 2100 could reduce the value of global financial assets by as much as $24 trillion5 - the UN currently estimates warming of 2.7ºC by 2100.6 The Director of the IMFs monetary and capital markets department has warned that the climate crisis could ""absolutely"" ignite a financial crisis.7 In the US, a recent report by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission found that climate-related risks could result in systemic shocks to the US financial system,8 and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has acknowledged that ""there is no doubt that climate change poses profound challenges for the global economy and certainly the financial system.""9 The recent report by the Financial Stability Oversight Council is premised on the assumption that “climate change is an emerging threat to the financial stability of the United States.”10 It is for these reasons that 3000 institutions have endorsed the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures to disclose information on their exposure to and management of climate-related financial risk.11 Additionally, over 450 financial firms responsible for assets of over $130 trillion have joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), including 100 banks, representing 44% of global banking assets, that have joined the affiliated Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). While these initiatives could be improved to ensure the financial sector is aligned with a 1.5ºC scenario,12 they illustrate the extent to which climate change has been recognized as a significant financial risk. In particular, as signatories to the NZBA, all six major Wall Street banks have publicly committed to “transition all operational and attributable GHG emissions from [their] lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net-zero by mid-century, or sooner…consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C 2KPMG,Climate risk is financial risk - for banks,it’s a board-level issue(April 7 2021) 3CERES,Addressing Climate as a Systemic Risk: A Call to Action for US Financial Regulators (June 2020), 4Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS),A call for Action: Climate Change as a Source of Financial Risk(April 2019) 5The Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change, London School of Economics and Political Science,Climate Value at Risk’ of global financial assets(April 2016) 6UNEP, UNEP DTU Partnership,Emissions Gap Report2021(October 26 2021) 7CNN Business,Climate change could ignite a financialcrisis, IMF official says(June 3 2021) 8Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee, Market Risk Advisory Committee of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission,Managing Climate Riskin the US Financial System(Sept 9 2020) 9CNN Business,Fed chair Powell warns of 'profoundchallenges' posed by climate change(June4 2021) 10Financial Stability Oversight Council,Report onClimate-related Financial Risk 2021 11Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures,TCFD Supporters around the world(accessed February 14 2021) 12See, for example, BankTrack, urgewald, Amazon Watch, Bank on our Future, Indigenous Environmental Network, Market Forces, Positive Money, Rainforest Action Network, Reclaim Finance, ShareAction & Sierra Club,New bank climate initiativefails to grasp urgent need to end finance for fossil fuels(April 22 2021) 1101 15th St NW, Ste 1100, Washington, DC 20005 USA | Tel 1.202.785.8700 | Fax 1.202.785.8701 | info@ciel.org 15 rue des Savoises, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland | Tel 41-22-789-0500 | Fax 41-22-789-0739 | geneva@ciel.org www.ciel.org
above pre-industrial levels by 2100.”13 Notably, this commitment includes their clients’ scope 3 emissions, and spells out an “expectation that governments will follow through on their own commitments to ensure that the objectives of the Paris Agreement are met.” Given this backdrop, the proposed Principles are in line with international consensus and serve to provide a level playing field for the banking sector. However, given the urgency of the climate crisis, with temperature rise already at 1.2ºC and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events demonstrating we are reaching the tipping point, it is imperative that this guidance, as amended, be quickly turned into legally enforceable rules. 2) Increasing bank reliance on false climate solutions warrants enhanced reporting While many large banks have made public commitments on achieving net zero by 2050, their financing practices remain largely at odds with these commitments. This is particularly evident in their continued financing of climate change drivers, most notably fossil fuel production and expansion, and simultaneous support for ineffective or unrealistic climate solutions, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) or offsets (collectively, “false climate solutions”). Since the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, the world’s 60 largest commercial and investment banks — aggregating their leading roles in lending and underwriting of debt and equity issuances — provided a total of $3.8 trillion into fossil fuels from 2016–2020.14 Of this financing, roughly 40% was directed to the 100 key oil, gas, and coal companies aggressively expanding fossil fuels globally. Wall Street banks, in the order of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, rank as the world’s top four largest bankers of fossil fuel expansion, despite their commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050. Such financing undermines achievement of the 1.5ºC goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, based on a recent International Energy Agency (IEA) report which found further development of fossil fuels is at odds with a net zero by 2050 pathway.15 In the absence of clear commitments to phase out fossil fuel financing or even fossil fuel expansion, banks are increasingly justifying their continued financing of fossil fuel sector clients by relying on CCS, technological carbon dioxide removal (CDR), or carbon offset strategies. However, none of these have proven to be viable at scale, and all pose other social and environmental risks such as air pollution and displacement of local communities. (1) CCS does not remove carbon from the atmosphere, nor does it capture all carbon emissions from the underlying source; it merely reduces them. CCS itself then adds back carbon emissions from the energy used in capturing, transporting, and storing carbon dioxide. CCS infrastructure is also extremely costly and expansive, and misrepresentations regarding the financial and physical feasibility of CCS may lead to 13Net-Zero Banking Alliance, Commitment Statement(April2021) 14Rainforest Action Network, BankTrack, Indigenous Environmental Network, Reclaim Finance, Sierra Club, Oil Change International,Banking on ClimateChaos: Fossil Fuel Finance Report 2021(March 2021) 15International Energy Agency, Net Zero by 2050(May2021) 1101 15th St NW, Ste 1100, Washington, DC 20005 USA | Tel 1.202.785.8700 | Fax 1.202.785.8701 | info@ciel.org 15 rue des Savoises, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland | Tel 41-22-789-0500 | Fax 41-22-789-0739 | geneva@ciel.org www.ciel.org
significantly increased costs for the company, stranded assets, carbon risk, or all of the above. (2) Technological CDR typically encompasses Direct Air Capture (DAC) or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). DAC proposes to use large machines to pull ambient carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere for use or storage. BECCS purports to make the combustion of bioenergy emissions negative by capturing and storing the carbon dioxide produced through CCS. Both DAC and BECCS require large amounts of land, water, and energy to function as envisioned by proponents. This input intensity has potentially devastating consequences for food security, livelihoods, and health of those affected, as well as significant opportunity costs in terms of other beneficial ways in which the energy and resources could be used. As such, neither is viable at scale without threatening human rights and present challenges similar to CCS above. (3) Offsets, which often involve land-based carbon sequestration, present various challenges in terms of quality assurance, effectiveness, and human rights, as described in the coalition letter referenced above, and fundamentally delay the need to reduce emissions overall as required to achieve the 1.5ºC goal of the Paris Agreement. In the timescale needed for climate action, the projects marketed as offsets, whether they be emissions avoidance offsets or carbon-removal offsets, can at best only limit the increase of emissions in the atmosphere overall rather than reduce global emissions owing to the different pace of carbon cycles between fossil fuels and ecological carbon sinks.16 Moreover, land-based sequestration projects are only impactful if permanent, which is increasingly uncertain due to the surge in forest fires. Numerous studies have demonstrated the ineffectiveness of offsets to operate as intended, increasing emissions instead.17 Financing offsets therefore fails to address the issues of financial stability associated with climate change, as it allows business as usual by climate drivers such as the fossil fuel industry to continue, despite the urgent need for a fossil fuel phase out, while putting unsustainable pressure on a finite area of land and forests to serve as carbon sinks. This in turn threatens local communities, food production, and the world’s biodiversity and exacerbates legal and reputational risks.18 Banks are also increasing their financing of fossil-based blue hydrogen, liquefied natural gas or large-scale biomass as purported transition fuels or alternatives to fossil fuels. Such categorization obscures the significant climate impact of these options.19 16See, for example, Brink News,Carbon Offsets Do NotReduce Carbon Emissions, Only Delay Them (March 7 2021) 17See, for example, CESifo,Do Carbon Offsets OffsetCarbon?(October 2021) 18See, for example, Friends of the Earth International et al,Chasing Carbon Unicorns: The Deception Of Carbon Markets and “Net Zero”(February 2021) 19See, for example, Global Witness,Why ‘blue hydrogen’is fossil fuel industry greenwash and won’t fix the climate(Oct 28 2020); Sierra Club,LNG Exports:A Bridge Too Far (June 29 2021); Guardian, Biomass is promoted as a carbon neutral fuel.

Bank tolerance for false climate solutions as a means to achieving their net zero commitments prolongs the operation of the underlying emitting facilities, delaying their replacement and the necessary transition to cleaner alternatives. Banks must therefore be fully transparent on their climate transition plans and explain whether and how they intend to rely on these false climate solutions to tackle the climate crisis and achieve their net zero goal. In particular, banks should articulate and quantify the emissions impact and associated costs of any technologies and offset mechanisms used, and disaggregate reporting on the amount of carbon emitted and reduced, carbon offsets, and GHG removals in their portfolios. 3) Climate Litigation Risk Climate change-related cases are on the rise, with over 1,000 cases having been brought to courts around the world in the last six years. Private sector actors, including financial actors, are increasingly being targeted. Already in 2015, then Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney observed that the risks arising from such litigation are “significant, uncertain and non-linear” and “will only increase as the science and evidence of climate change hardens.”20 In 2021 alone, a Netherlands court ruled that the oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell has to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 to align its policies with the Paris Agreement,21 and the first climate-related case was brought against a central bank, the National Bank of Belgium.22 The former case is on appeal, while the latter case is pending. Owing to this trend, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) has recently identified climate-related litigation as a growing source of risk, and one that can have significant material impact on financial actors. Five potential impacts identified by the NGFS include: (1) successful litigation against a bank’s client, resulting in fines and costs that affect the value of the firm, its creditworthiness and/or its financing costs; (2) cases against financial actors for failing to appropriately disclose and manage climate-related risks; (3) breach of contract claims relating to green financial products; (4) cases alleging breaches of fiduciary duties by the bank’s directors for continuing to favor the financing of climate change drivers; and (5) cases against financial actors as “indirect polluters” for financing polluting projects. In addition, climate-related cases brought on the grounds of human rights violations are on the rise,23 targeting both governments and corporations; banks could be impacted in ways similar to (1), (4) and (5) above from the perspective of human rights, particularly in light of their human rights responsibilities as articulated in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. NGFS has recommended that “the risks associated with climate-related litigation vis-à-vis 20Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon – climate changeand financial stability, speech given by Mark Carney at Lloyd’s of London (September 29 2015) 21Milieudefensie et al. v.

financial and non-financial corporations should be taken into account in microprudential supervision and financial stability monitoring.”24 They note that this is because of the potential magnitude of the financial impact from these suits; wide scope of entities that can be affected, that the impact of climate-related litigation could materialize in a non-linear manner resulting in a surge of litigation; the increasing incorporation of climate commitments into laws and regulations; and the unique characteristics of climate change as a global risk. Given this, the risk of climate-related litigation should be elevated in the guidance from its current categorization as “other non-financial risk,” and require financial institutions to be more explicit in how they are managing financial and operational risks resulting from potential litigation against themselves as well as against institutions to which they are exposed. 4) Feedback on Select Questions Q4: . What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? Banks with advanced risk management frameworks have taken measures to ensure their public climate commitments are fully integrated into their internal processes, including in how they vet potential clients and review ongoing financing. In particular, it is important that banks establish publicly available financing policies which are reflected in their conditions for financing as laid out in contractual agreements for loans, underwriting, and other financial services. Embedding these commitments into contracts is essential for ensuring enforceability, and can also be used to stipulate expectations of the client, such as disclosure of transition plans and scope 3 emissions (for further analysis, see below). Some good practices in bank due diligence on environmental and social risks, including on contractual agreements mentioned above, can be found in the OECD Responsible Business Conduct guidelines for commercial banks.25 Q5: How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? Banks typically rely on information disclosed by clients to determine the materiality of risks. However, given the scale of greenwashing (e.g. failure of companies to disclose Scope 3 emissions) and failure of regulatory bodies to monitor high-emitting activities (e.g. fracking operations and methane leaks in the Permian Basin26), banks should be required to diversify their sources of information to include consultation with independent experts who have no pecuniary interests in favor of the client or related industries. Experts, such as scientists and civil society organizations, often have more in depth knowledge of the negative impacts 24Network for Greening the Financial System,Climate-related litigation: Raising awareness about a growing source of risk(November 2021) 25OECD,Due Diligence for Responsible Corporate Lendingand Securities Underwriting: Key considerations for banks implementing the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises(2019) 26See Center for International Environmental Law, Earthworks & Oil Change International,Permian Climate Bomb: Ch. 6 Regulatory Failure(2021) 1101 15th St NW, Ste 1100, Washington, DC 20005 USA | Tel 1.202.785.8700 | Fax 1.202.785.8701 | info@ciel.org 15 rue des Savoises, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland | Tel 41-22-789-0500 | Fax 41-22-789-0739 | geneva@ciel.org www.ciel.org
associated with certain client activities. Given the strong links between climate change destructive activities and human rights violations, banks should also be required to consult with affected communities to ground-truth the risks associated with the financing. Q8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? The use of “green” bonds and “sustainability”-linked loans have been on the rise, but there have been many instances where these instruments have been used to greenwash business-as-usual activities. For example, JBS - the largest meat company in the world with strong ties to Amazon deforestation, sold $1 billion USD of sustainability-linked bonds to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions - however, 90% of its emissions are associated with its Scope 3 supply chain activities, thus severely limiting the climate impact of the bond.27 A similar strategy was pursued by the Canadian tar sands company Enbridge, which recently completed construction of an extremely controversial and high-carbon tar sands pipeline in Minnesota called Line 3: it deliberately excluded its largest climate footprint - Scope 3 emissions - from its sustainability-linked credit facility, while continuing to expand fossil fuel infrastructure.28 The proliferation of these deceptive instruments29 can implicate banks in fraudulent misrepresentation if, for example, they underwrite such bonds or serve as bookrunners and lead arrangers to such loans. Moreover, these instruments fail to mitigate the climate crisis or the banks’ exposure to climate risk. Banks should therefore be required to be very explicit in their criteria for labeling financial services as “sustainable”, “green” or “clean”, and to make public an exclusion list of the activities that would not qualify. Q10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? As illustrated in the examples above, borrowers’ measurement and disclosure of Scope 3 emissions can be extremely important for understanding climate risk exposure, particularly in the case of borrowers involved in fossil fuels, including related infrastructure, or those with carbon-intensive supply chains. Where such relevant information is lacking, it is critical that banks disclose such information deficiencies that result in an undercounting of their financed emissions. Scope 3 emissions reporting, including reporting for emissions over time, is especially critical in the context of financing for carbon capture or carbon removal schemes. For example, financing 27Forests & Finance,Brazilian Meat Company JBS Issues“Sustainability-Linked”Bonds(June 23 2021) 28Reclaim Finance,Enbridge’s “sustainable” credit:tar sands and rights violations(October 3 2021) 29For further analysis, see Reclaim Finance,GreenBonds: Watch Out It Could Be A Trap! 1101 15th St NW, Ste 1100, Washington, DC 20005 USA | Tel 1.202.785.8700 | Fax 1.202.785.8701 | info@ciel.org 15 rue des Savoises, 1205 Geneva, Switzerland | Tel 41-22-789-0500 | Fax 41-22-789-0739 | geneva@ciel.org www.ciel.org
for a carbon dioxide pipeline as part of a carbon capture and storage project might appear carbon-negative if only Scopes 1 and 2 emissions are considered. The entire project, however, may increase emissions overall, if CCS extends the useful life of the emitting facility, if the captured carbon is used for enhanced oil recovery (a form of oil production), or both. Additionally, for those borrowers who intend to rely on mechanisms such as CCS, CDR, or offsets, it is important that they report on not only the projected emissions, emissions reductions or carbon removals, but also their actual quantities upon verification by a credible third party, given the history of failure of such mechanisms. The history of carbon capture projects is a long series of overpromising and under-delivering,30 with facilities failing to achieve anticipated capture rates, failing to operate as consistently as expected, or both. As noted above, bank reporting should distinguish between reductions in financed emissions that result from financing fewer climate change-causing activities (e.g. fossil fuels), and the financing of projects intended to remove carbon dioxide from waste streams or the atmosphere (CCS, carbon removal) or offset existing emissions, and report each separately. Given the importance of short-term measures to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, including halving emissions by 2030, any metrics and tools should place more weight on short-term climate mitigation measures, with a priority on emissions reduction. Q11: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? We reiterate that requiring the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions is critical to enabling banks to accurately report on their exposure to climate-related financial risks. Where methodologies to calculate such emissions are still in development, as an interim measure, companies should be required to clearly explain any emissions that are not being accounted for and their plans to address the deficiency. Banks would also benefit from a requirement that companies disclose their transition plans for aligning with the 1.5ºC scenario, including short term (2~3 years) and medium term (2030) measures. As recently warned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the planet is likely to reach the crucial threshold of 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels by as early as 2030, precipitating the risk of extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people.31 Global mean temperatures are expected to continue to increase until net zero CO2 emissions are reached, and therefore whether temperatures overshoot 1.5°C will depend on how quickly emissions are lowered. However, the potential reversibility of global mean temperature does not mean that the impacts of climate change can be reversed, and impacts such as sea level rise, loss of ecosystem functionality, accelerated species extinction, 30See, e.g., David Schlissel et al.,Institute forEnergy Economics and Financial Analysis, Blue Hydrogen: Technology Challenges, Weak Commercial Prospects, and Not Greenslides 18-23 (2022). 31IPCC,Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis- Summary for Policymakers(2021),IPCC, IPCC,Global Warming of 1.5°C.

and loss of glaciers for example may not be reversible for millenia.32 The risk of overshoot of 1.5ºC and the risk of irreversibility underscores the critical importance of near term measures to drastically reduce emissions and not rely on mechanisms that may incentivize delay. Q13: What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? Given the significance of limiting warming to 1.5ºC and the prevalence of net zero by 2050 commitments, companies should be required to utilize a 1.5ºC scenario, at minimum. The scenario analysis should also be verified by a credible third party entity. In such a scenario analysis, banks should be required to clarify the role of false climate solutions such as CCS and offsets and be limited in their reliance on these mechanisms to the extent that they are feasible. ***** Thank you for your leadership and attention to this urgent issue.

Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and announce new climate plans, they have continued to invest billions into fossil fuels every year. Through these investments, banks are directly fueling the climate crisis- putting our most vulnerable communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change and stop their reckless investment decisions from endangering our economy and communities. I support the proposed guidance's recommendations to banks that they: incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting limits; and make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments. The OCC must ensure that banks' actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks' management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate. 1,084 of these signers, you might also notice, added their own additional personal comments. If there are any questions about this statement or our positions on this matter do not hesitate to contact us.

kzn-8y6c-ilyy,"Via Regulations.gov Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Washington, D.C. Re: Public consultation on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Comptroller Hsu: On behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), we are pleased to submit these comments on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) proposed Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. NRDC is an international nonprofit environmental organization with more than 3 million members and online activists. Since 1970, our lawyers, scientists, and other environmental specialists have worked to protect the world’s natural resources, public health, and environment. NRDC has offices in New York City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Montana, and Beijing. Through its finance and legal experts, NRDC remains engaged in financial regulation and views sensible financial regulation as an integral part of mitigating climate change. We appreciate the OCC’s leadership on this first, key step to integrate climate- related financial risk into its prudential supervision of large banks. Climate change presents a serious threat to individual banks and to the financial system. Banks should be encouraged to identify and mitigate climate-related financial risk and supervisory guidance from the OCC ensures that banks will rigorously undertake those efforts. “Climate change,” according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, “is an emerging threat to the financial stability of the United States.”1 The White House’s Climate Finance Report also emphasized that climate change poses risk for individual companies: “Across the board, hidden and underestimated risks from climate change obscure the growing potential for business disruptions, productivity loss, and bankruptcies.”2 Climate-related financial risks fall, broadly speaking, into two categories: physical risks and transition risks. “Physical risks refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute, climate-related disaster events such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves as well as longer-term chronic phenomena such as higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, sea-level rise, and ocean 1 Financial Stability Oversight Council, FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk at 3 (2021). 2 U.S. Climate Related Financial Risk Executive Order 14030, A Roadmap to Build a Climate-Resilient Economy at 4 (2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp- content/uploads/2021/10/Climate-Finance-Report.pdf. 1
acidification.”3 Transition risks arise “from the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change.”4 Companies have identified climate change as a significant source of short and medium-term risk. The Carbon Disclosure Project reported that 215 of the world’s 500 largest companies collectively identified approximately $1 trillion in climate risks to their businesses as of 2018.5 Over half of these risks were projected as likely to occur within the next five years.6 If this risk is not managed properly, the banking system could amplify the costs of climate change. A 2019 study published in Nature Climate Change found that climate risks could increase the frequency and severity of financial crises and the costs to the public of remedying those crises. The authors stressed that prudent financial regulation was key to mitigating future crises. We appreciate that the OCC is taking this important first step to manage climate risk in the banking industry. Our comments below address several of the questions that OCC posed in its Federal Register notice. 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? While we appreciate that guidance and oversights will start with the largest banks, it is essential to continue to expand guidance and oversight to all sized banks in the near term. Providing clear guidance for expectations and a timeline for smaller banks can help them prepare for both the risks themselves as well as upcoming examiner expectations. An additional need for clarity on upcoming examiner expectations for smaller banks, larger banks, while dealing with their own climate risk, could push their risks off onto other financial entities7, including smaller banks, possibly increasing climate risks for these smaller banks. 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? NRDC agrees that banks can use insurance and derivatives to mitigate climate- related financial risks, but there is a danger of solely relying on such measures to mitigate these risks. Banks require insurance coverage to mitigate potential losses due 3 Id. at 12. 4 Id. at 13. 5 Carbon Disclosure Project, Major Risk or Rosy Opportunity at 5 (2019). 6 Id. 7 Keenan, J.M., Bradt, J.T. Underwaterwriting: from theory to empiricism in regional mortgage markets in the U.S.. Climatic Change 162, 2043–2067 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02734-1. 2
to any loss event, including climate disasters. However, risks from both the insured and/or the insurer could revert the climate-related risks to the banks themselves. Borrowers are required to provide proof of insurance coverage for loan closing purposes. However, as regions prone to climate change effects are subject to increased risk pricing, higher premiums (or worse, the discontinuation of coverage) can lead to a lapse in coverage for borrowers in these areas. These lapses in coverage can be overlooked due to the loose enforcement of maintaining the required coverage. Counterparty risk could also swell during climate disasters as the insurers themselves are highly susceptible to climate-related risks. Many insurers invest their assets in investments vulnerable to climate disasters or transition risk. Climate events could drain the liquidity of asset pools used for payouts. Moreover, improperly assessed climate risks can lead to insufficient payouts as risk assessment maps of disaster-prone regions are not up to date. 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? In its draft document, OCC states: “The board and management should consider how climate-related financial risks and risk mitigation measures affect the legal and regulatory landscape in which the bank operates. This consideration includes … possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity.”8 NRDC agrees that banks must be encouraged to consider the fair lending implications of their climate risk strategies. As outlined below, there is a real danger that the adoption of enhanced climate risk mitigation measures by banks may result in disproportionate treatment of or impact to climate-burdened communities, including lower-income communities and communities of color. We urge OCC to expand upon the cursory guidance provided in the draft document and to consider additional regulatory actions to address likely impacts on disadvantaged communities. Fair lending laws prohibit banks from engaging in discriminatory lending practices.9 There are two categories of discriminatory practices for fair lending 8 OCC, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, p5. 9 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a); 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a). The Equal Credit Opportunity Act proscribes discrimination on the basis of race or color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, source of income, or attempted exercise of consumer rights. The Fair Housing Act proscribed discrimination on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap. Id. 3
purposes. Disparate treatment occurs when a lender treats a borrower differently based on a proscribed characteristic, such as race or sex. Disparate impact occurs when a facially neutral policy or practice disproportionately burdens a protected class of persons.10 If a disparate impact exists, the lender must show that the policy or practice is justified by “business necessity.” Even if a business necessity exists, however, the lender may be liable if there are alternative policies that serve the same purpose with less discriminatory effect.11 Because fair lending violations may carry substantial financial penalties for banks, fair lending risk is an important consideration in OCC’s risk-based supervision regime.12 Ensuring that banks comply with fair lending laws is also essential to OCC’s broader mission of “assuring … fair access to financial services, and fair treatment of customers by, the institutions and other persons subject to its jurisdiction.”13 Fair lending risk is especially acute where risks are distributed unevenly among potential borrowers in a manner that aligns with one or more protected characteristics, such as race. Climate change fits squarely within this category. A substantial and growing literature demonstrates that many climate-related risks, such as the risk of weather-induced disaster or sea level rise, may be disproportionately borne by lower income communities and communities of color.14 A November 2021 Staff Report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveyed this literature and concluded that “regions of the United States that are home to above-average shares of low-income and minority groups are likely to suffer the greatest meteorological effects of climate change.”15 The report also found that “low-income and minority Americans are limited in how they may adapt to climate change because they have less access to insurance and are less likely to have access to credit when needed.”16 10 See Regulation B, 12 CFR Part 1002, Comment 6(a); 24 CFR 100 s 100.500. 11 Id. 12 See OCC, Comptroller’s Handbook: Fair Lending, https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/comptrollers- handbook/files/fair-lending/pub-ch-fair-lending.pdf 13 12 USC § 1(a). 14 See, e.g., Buchanan, Maya K., Scott Kulp, Lara Cushing, Rachel Morello-Frosch, Todd Nedwick, and Benjamin Strauss. “Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Threaten Affordable Housing.” Environmental Research Letters 15, no. 12 (2020): 124020; Keenan, Jesse, and Elizabeth Mattiuzzi. “Climate Adaptation Investment and the Community Reinvestment Act.” Community Development Research Brief 05 (2019): 01-30; Furman Center, Population in the U.S. Floodplains, https://furmancenter.org/files/Floodplain_PopulationBrief_12DEC2017.pdf 15 Understanding the Linkages between Climate Change and Inequality in the United States, p2. 16 Id. 4
The close correlation between climate and race (among other factors) raises the possibility that bank policies and practices intended to mitigate climate risk may create fair lending liability through disparate treatment of or (more likely) disparate impacts on borrowers of color. Moreover, even where bank practices do not give rise to legal liability under fair lending laws, they may unreasonably restrict access to financial services within climate-burdened communities.17 Of particular concern are risk mitigation measures that force individual households and small businesses to internalize climate-related risks. Such measures may significantly restrict access to credit within already-disadvantaged communities, further reducing their capacity to respond to climate-related challenges such as weather-related disasters or sea level rise. Such measures may also expose lenders to fair lending risk under the disparate impact standard if a less-discriminatory alternative exists. For this reason, NRDC recommends that banks avoid adopting policies that seek to mitigate climate risk by restricting access to credit for individual low-income and minority households and small business. To ensure compliance with fair lending obligations and promote fair access to financial services, NRDC recommends that OCC’s guidance document incorporate the following principles: • Banks should carefully and holistically assess their climate risk management policies and practices for potential disparate treatment or impact on the basis of race or other protected classes. • Banks should collect sufficient data on lending in climate-burdened communities to understand whether their lending practices result in discriminatory treatment or impact. The data should be disclosed to OCC and closely monitored on an ongoing basis for fair lending risk. In addition, banks should ensure that all data and models relied upon to assess climate-related risk do not include built-in biases. • Banks should provide fair lending training to all staff involved in assessing climate risk for lending purposes. The guidance should make clear that OCC will closely scrutinize banks’ climate risk management practices in accordance with the above principles. In addition, NRDC strongly encourages OCC to consider additional regulatory actions to ensure fair access to financial services within climate-burdened communities, such as updating official Handbooks and supervisory materials to include climate- related fair lending guidance, encouraging banks to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements through investment in climate adaptation measures in at-risk 17 Cf. 12 USC 1(a) (requiring OCC to ensure ”fair access to financial services”). 5
communities, and/or issuing further guidance or regulation on fair lending and climate. OCC should also coordinate closely with FSOC and other relevant federal agencies (such as FEMA and HUD) to ensure that regulatory changes in the financial sector do not inhibit whole-of-government efforts to ensure an equitable climate transition. 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? We recommend that the OCC ask banks to obtain a complete picture of climate risk for significant borrowers and counterparties. The data providing such a complete picture has three key components: Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, geolocation information for significant infrastructure, and any climate or sustainability disclosures made by the borrower or counterparty. Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions tell banks about a borrower or counterparty’s contribution to climate change and their vulnerability to transition risk in an orderly or disorderly move to a low emissions economy. “Scope 1 emissions are direct [greenhouse gas[ emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization. . . . Scope 2 emissions are indirect [greenhouse gas] emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling.” Scope 3 emissions are everything else: “the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain. . . . Scope 3 emissions, also referred to as value chain emissions, often represent the majority of an organization’s total GHG emissions.”18 The volume and trend of greenhouse gas emissions informs a bank’s picture of how a borrower or counterparty is managing transition risk. To gauge physical risk, banks should also obtain geolocational information for key infrastructure from borrowers. This would certainly include any collateralized infrastructure, but also information on any infrastructure that underpins significant operations. If, for example, a borrower has significant property on a coastline vulnerable to tidal flooding and extreme weather, that information ought to inform a bank’s risk analysis. Finally, banks should obtain borrower or counterparty disclosures under any climate or sustainability disclosure framework. Some of this information would be duplicative of the greenhouse gas emissions and physical risk inventory discussed 18 EPA.gov, “GHG Inventory Development Process and Guidance,” https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/ghg-inventory-development-process-and- guidance. 6
above, but disclosure frameworks also call for information about board oversight of climate risks, internal processes for identifying and managing climate risk, and projected financial impacts of climate risk. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? In addition to the scenario analysis guidance discussed below, we recommend that the OCC have banks report on their financed emissions, which is the volume of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the bank’s lending portfolio. The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials has developed guidance to assist financial institutions with calculating their financed emissions, including guidance about how to estimate the percentage of emissions from an activity attributable to the bank’s financing.19 As with knowing a borrower’s footprint of greenhouse gas emissions, a bank’s financed emissions footprint and its trajectory over time helps regulators assess the bank’s vulnerability to transition risk. 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? We agree that scenario analysis is an important climate risk management tool, and we believe it is one that all banks should be using to evaluate their climate risk and take appropriate steps to mitigate that risk. While banks seem to agree that scenario analysis is important, a recent study suggests that fewer than 10 percent of all banks are using it at the moment, and small banks are less likely to have incorporated scenario analysis into their climate risk management plans. Obtaining reliable information about borrowers’ climate risks is a problem for all banks (indeed, obtaining reliable information about companies’ climate risk is a general problem for regulators and stakeholders). For small banks that do not lend to public companies, it is an even greater challenge. The OCC can advance banks’ use of scenario analysis by providing supervisory guidance on its role in risk management and the appropriate scenarios for banks to use in scenario analysis. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? We strongly support the inclusion of scenario analysis for understanding the risks banks face. Past risks from extreme weather will not be a reliable predictor of climate risk, so banks will need to use models that consider that future risk. Thus, any 19 PCAF, “The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry,” https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/standard#the-global-ghg- accounting-and-reporting-standard-for-the-financial-industry. 7
guidance from the OCC on scenario analysis should emphasize the importance of using models that align with the latest climate science and that assume a range of global average temperature increases, including worst case scenarios. And to model transition risk, scenario analyses should include orderly and disorderly transitions to a low carbon economy. We encourage the OCC to use its supervisory guidance authority to ensure that all banks eventually use scenario analysis in their climate risk evaluations, and to eventually incorporate climate stress testing into its examinations. The OCC’s use of its supervisory authority can ensure that climate risk is consistently modeled, evaluated, and mitigated by banks of all sizes. *** We thank the OCC for its consideration of our comments. If we can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. __________________________ Sarah Dougherty Alfonso Pating Sam Whillans Tom Zimpleman Natural Resources Defense Council 1152 15th St. NW Suite 300 Washington, DC 20005 8","The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) submitted comments on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) proposed principles for managing climate-related financial risks in large banks.

Box 2300 Tulsa, Oklahoma 74102 February 14, 2022 Chief Counsel’s Office, Attn: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th Street, SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Via electronic delivery – regs.comments@occ.treas.gov Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Docket ID OCC-2021-0023) Ladies and Gentlemen: BOK Financial is a $50 billion full-service commercial banking organization with branches serving Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas. Climate risk is an important subject and we appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We believe it is important for banks to support the consumers and businesses in their communities as the US economy transitions toward a less carbon intensive future. We have two comments regarding the principles outlined. Question 1 - Applicability We support a threshold of $100 Billion or higher in total consolidated assets based on the following observations. Advanced and rigorous capital adequacy and liquidity risk management requirements such as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) apply at the $250 billion size threshold with Federal Reserve discretion to apply such requirements to banks as low as $100 billion. Banks below those thresholds certainly perform capital adequacy and liquidity risk measurement and management processes that are appropriate for their scale and complexity. However, the very high level of rigor and difficulty inherent in CCAR and the other SIFI requirements is reserved for the largest banks who are in a position to accommodate the stringency of the requirements. This aligns with congressional intent. Climate risk regulatory requirements may be just as challenging as those for CCAR, although for very different reasons. 1. Climate risk modeling approaches are in their infancy, and the R&D effort requires scale not found in banks below $100 billion.
P. O. Box 2300 Tulsa, Oklahoma 74102 2. Data challenges could be very significant, as it is not yet clear exactly what data is needed, and many of the categories of climate-related data have generally not been captured as there has been no historical reason to make such a large data-gathering investment. 3. Mid-size banks do not currently have the infrastructure to build and maintain the models and scenarios described in the Climate-Related principles. 4. Mid-size banks will need to learn from the processes developed by sophisticated industry participants, and then develop approaches which reflect their size, exposure and complexity. 5. Initial efforts of mid-sized banks might be best focused on highest risk areas, rather than being spread thin on broad compliance with a rigorous comprehensive rule. Executive management, boards of directors, and investors of mid-sized banks will intrinsically seek to understand climate risk exposure. Prudential regulators will also expect climate risk to be addressed as part of standard risk management expectations for mid-sized banks. Mid-sized banks will develop approaches to climate risk management in ways that are both effective and efficient. Because climate risk measurement and modeling is in such an early an immature stage, we believe the most productive initial approach for mid-sized banks is to spend effort on seeking an understanding of which risks they are most exposed to. The imposition of a disproportionately large compliance burden may effectively stifle the R&D efforts really needed by mid-sized banks to dimension their risks appropriately. Question 7 – Risk Management We have exposure to physical risk due to the impact of weather events on collateral which secures our loans. Real estate is the primary example but not the only example. Insurance requirements for loan collateral is part of long standing normal lending policies and practices. Insurance contracts cover causes of damage including fire, water, wind, flood, and other sources. The historical effectiveness of this risk mitigation practice has been strong. I hope these comments prove to be useful. Please contact me if you have any follow-up questions. Sincerely, Martin Grunst Executive Vice President Chief Risk Officer","BOK Financial, a $50 billion commercial banking organization, comments on the ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks."" They support a threshold of $100 billion in total consolidated assets for applicability, arguing that smaller banks lack the scale and infrastructure to meet rigorous climate risk requirements. They highlight challenges such as immature climate risk modeling, significant data needs, and the lack of infrastructure in mid-sized banks. BOK Financial suggests that mid-sized banks should focus on high-risk areas rather than broad compliance, as excessive compliance burdens could hinder necessary R&D efforts. They also address physical risk exposure due to weather events impacting loan collateral, noting that insurance requirements have historically mitigated these risks effectively. The comment emphasizes the need for mid-sized banks to develop efficient climate risk management approaches tailored to their size and complexity."
kzn-aw55-7y8m,"Dear Comptroller Hsu, As an organization guided by the Quaker belief in the divine light within each person, the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) works to promote a world free of violence, inequality, and oppression. As such, we cannot ignore the pressing threats that climate change poses to the most vulnerable communities on the earth. We cannot ignore the ways that ongoing fossil fuel financing by big banks bolsters the affluence of the rich and powerful at the expense of our collective well-being.  At AFSC, multiple programs work towards just and sustainable peace, just economies, and a just response to forces displacement and migration. In this work, a lens of climate justice informs our efforts. We see climate change as a root cause for myriad issues facing our society. Climate change is a driver of violence, socio-economic disruption, and displacement. Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, the largest banks have invested more than $3.8 trillion in oil, gas, and coal production. JPMorgan Chase, Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America have loaned more money to the fossil fuel industry than any other banks in the world. Banks’ continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. AFSC programs across the country and the world work with vulnerable communities to support dignity and justice for all. Our communities are seeing firsthand the effects of climate change on their local environments and the ways that these changes are exacerbating inequality across regions and borders. Drought in New Mexico and California is threatening food security and causing heat exhaustion in workers. Drought in the MENA region is intensifying conflict over water and arable land. Hurricanes in Central America are destroying infrastructure and displacing families.  AFSC has a long history of advancing peace and justice through economic activism. Throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, AFSC has reckoned with how our possessions and our capital are tied to injustice,  and in the context of our modern financial system, how socially responsible investing and shareholder advocacy can drive change that prioritizes people over profits. In accordance with this mission, at AFSC we operate on a socially responsible investment policy that strengthens and expands divestment from prisons, militarism, border industry, apartheid, and environmental devastation.  On Earth Day 2019, recognizing the social impact of climate change on the communities we work with and the Quaker commitment to good stewardship of resources, AFSC announced its divestment from the fossil fuel industry.  Comptroller Hsu, we need you to recognize the power that financial institutions hold in either protecting or destroying the environment that we all depend on. We need you to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers we face from climate change and stop big banks’ short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities. We support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: 1. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon and update models as additional data becomes available; 3. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting limits; 4. Make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings as well. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate. Climate change is here, and its drivers are not unknown or untouchable. Financial institutions that continue to facilitate the exploitation of natural resources and the burning of fossil fuels are prioritizing their profits over our collective futures. We must hold them accountable. Comptroller Hsu, please use the full extent of your authority to curtail banks’ investments in climate change, for the future of our economy and our planet.","The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), guided by Quaker beliefs, urges Comptroller Hsu to address the role of banks in climate change. AFSC highlights the threat climate change poses to vulnerable communities and criticizes banks for financing fossil fuels, which exacerbates inequality and environmental harm. Despite public commitments to climate action, major banks have invested over $3.8 trillion in fossil fuels since the Paris Agreement. AFSC advocates for socially responsible investing and has divested from fossil fuels. They support proposed guidance for banks to integrate climate risk management, plan for long-term climate impacts, and ensure internal strategies align with public commitments. AFSC calls for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to enforce strong guidance on climate risk, hold banks accountable, and prioritize environmental protection over profits."

For years, Friends of the Earth US has advocated for more sustainable funding mechanisms and actions from federal financial regulators. Friends of the Earth US has a dedicated Economic Policy team that works to redirect tax policies and public spending to make polluters pay for the costs of their pollution, and to drive the transition to a cleaner, low-carbon economy. At home and abroad, we advocate for policies that minimize environmental and social harm and fund a brighter future. In the United States, we strengthen regulations to encourage sustainability in financial markets and fight trade policies that allow companies to run roughshod over the environment and human rights. We also work with allies around the world to alter lending practices at financial institutions such as the World Bank, the U.S. Export-Import Bank and Wall Street banks that fund polluting activities and harm communities in developing countries. Introduction Acting Comptroller of The Currency, Michael Hsu, said in November 2021 that banks should be screened for climate risk as part of their regular stress tests, and that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) own regulatory approach was focused on ensuring the financial system's safety and soundness. “All this is going to take some time, and it’s going take some work—we recognize that”2 Mr. Hsu noted. “We need to build towards these muscles, because that’s how this turns into action.”3 We appreciate the recognition that banks need to do more on climate risk. However, a non-binding guidance that merely provides guiding principles for banks with assets of $100 Billion or more is not enough.

financing, but also the effect of their financing on the climate. The latter is starkly absent from OCC’s proposed guidance; for the reasons discussion herein, this lack of coverage causes Friends of the Earth significant concern. In January 2021, U.S President Joe Biden took an initial step toward rejoining the global accord, Paris climate change agreement, which was a landmark achievement of former President Barack Obama and from which former President Donald Trump later withdrew.4 Each country established its own pledge to combat climate change under the Paris Agreement, which was negotiated in 2015 and signed in 2016.5 President Biden signed an Executive Order on Climate- Related Financial Risks in May 2021, instructing the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to assess and report on specific climate risks.6 Section 3 of the Order titled “Assessment of Climate-Related Financial Risk by Financial Regulators” requires the Secretary of the Treasury, as Chair of the FSOC, to “engage with FSOC members to consider the necessity of any actions to enhance climate-related disclosures by regulated entities to mitigate climate-related financial risk to the financial system or assets and a recommended implementation plan for taking those actions,” and to issue a report to the President within 180 days of the date of the order on any efforts by FSOC member agencies to integrate consideration of climate-related financial risk in their policies and programs, including “any current approaches to incorporating the consideration of climate-related financial risk into their respective regulatory and supervisory activities and any impediments they faced in adopting those approaches.”7 4 Russell Gold et al., President Biden Quickly Rejoined Paris Climate Accord.

Federal officials, non-governmental entities, and the general public have advocated for a larger effort to combat climate change via executive branch agencies or independent regulators. They want the Federal Reserve to have a stronger hand in influencing finance in the fossil-fuel business.8 A Supervision Climate Committee (SCC) was recently established by the Federal Reserve to analyze and mitigate climate-related risks to supervised firms,9 and OCC has issued the proposed guidance at issue here. But this is not enough. It is crucial for the SCC to collaborate with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and OCC to develop and disseminate mandatory, binding regulations, instead of supervisory guidelines, on climate-related risks as fast as possible.10 Bank regulators in the United States should also look to international peers that are steps ahead with implementing climate-related regulations.11 Banking regulators must invest in internal climate capacity and ensure that examiners are adequately trained to ensure that these institutions are functioning in a safe and sound manner with respect to these risks as part of this effort.12 Integrating climate risk into continuing supervision would support the development of new climate-related legislation and guarantee that climate issues are correctly centered in core decision- making functions at banks.13 Issuing guidance will not accomplish as much as enforceable regulations that oblige banks to incorporate both climate and financial sector risks into their risk management frameworks since 8 Pete Schroeder, Wall Street sees first Fed climate change review in 2023, REUTERS (Nov. 17, 2021, 8:39 PM) https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/wall-street-sees-first-fed-climate-change-review-2023-2021-11-17/; “Moreover, Congress could go even further than financial regulators’ significant, but constrained, authority and more directly phase out fossil fuel financing in an orderly fashion to mitigate these risks.” Gregg Gelzinis, Addressing Climate-Related Financial Risk Through Bank Capital Requirements, CTR.

banks have already objected to the development of climate-related stress tests.14 They claim that climate-related shocks and their impacts are highly unpredictable, and that modeling them would be difficult.15 It is important to clarify that stress tests are not intended to forecast the future.16 Rather, they are used to “test bank balance sheets against extreme, but plausible, scenarios.” 17 Given the aim and significance of stress testing, these issues are far from insurmountable. Furthermore, banks have complained about the scenarios’ extended time horizons when it comes to assumptions about bank balance sheets.18 As a matter of fact, banks’ arguments against climate-related stress tests are similar to their arguments against the initial stress tests, the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, and the annual macroeconomic tests devised in the aftermath of 2007-2009 financial crisis, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.19 Banks have been at odds with the Federal Reserve for the past 12 years on what constitutes appropriate or realistic scenarios, models, and assumptions.20 Mr. Hsu has urged the financial services industry to take climate change risk more seriously.21 The proposed guidance demonstrates the regulator's desire to encourage banks to 14 Francisco Covas, Challenges in Stress Testing and Climate Change, BANK POL'Y INST.

consider their climate risk, and in fact the largest US Banks have begun to devote resources, albeit insufficiently, to this area.22 Mr. Hsu detailed efforts by OCC to push banks to get a better handle on the risks posed to their balance sheets by climate change and extreme weather events at the WSJ Pro’s Sustainable Business Forum in December. Nevertheless, banks will keep resisting and argue that the cost outweighs the risk. Under the proposed guidance, such resistance will be an effective strategy for banks to avoid adopting robust, predictive risk-management tools. It is finally time for OCC to issue regulations mandating banks to, in fact, fully assess climate- and finance-related risks and adjust their balance sheets over time to avoid these long- term risks. OCC is empowered to take several types of official enforcement actions against financial institutions and parties linked with them.23 I. OCC’s Authority over Banks General Regulatory Power of OCC It is within the scope of OCC’s powers to issue regulations targeting national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies of foreign banking organizations.24 The main duties of OCC consist of chartering, regulating, and supervising all national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.25 OCC makes certain that the banks it oversees are safe and sound, that they provide fair access to financial services, that they treat clients fairly, and that they follow all applicable laws and regulations.26 22 Id. 23Enforcement Action Types, OCC, https://www.occ.gov/topics/laws-and-regulations/enforcement- actions/enforcement-action-types/index-enforcement-action-types.html (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 24 Id. 25Who We Are, OCC, https://www.occ.treas.gov/about/who-we-are/index-who-we-are.html (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 26 Id. 6
One of the core mission functions of the agency is to supervise banks and establish appropriate policies.27 OCC enjoys broad regulatory powers under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). SOX Section 11.1 provides that “[t]he Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is vested with the powers, functions, and duties otherwise vested in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to administer and enforce the provisions of sections . . . of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . . . for national banks and Federal savings associations with one or more classes of securities subject to the registration provisions of sections 12(b) and (g) of the Exchange Act . . . [f]urther, OCC has general rulemaking authority under 12 U.S.C. §§ 93(a), 1462(a), 1463, and 1464, to promulgate rules and regulations concerning the activities of national banks and Federal savings associations.”28 The U.S. Code mirrors the SOX provision as it gives OCC the authority to issue rules and regulations to carry out the office’s functions.29 Section 1463 notes that OCC’s regulations targeting savings associations must be as stringent as those established for national banks.30 Other functions of OCC consist of assessing and reviewing banks’ compliance with SOX standards.31 More specifically, banks that have a class of securities registered with OCC under 12 C.F.R. § 11 or 12 C.F.R. § 16 are subject to this type of supervision.32 OCC could cite a violation of law on the specific section of SOX at the bank level if the overall compliance program, including §404 supporting documentation, reveals any significant weaknesses.33 27Supervision Risk and Analysis, OCC, https://www.occ.treas.gov/about/who-we-are/organizations/supervision-risk- and-analysis/index-supervision-risk-and-analysis.html (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 28 Section 11.1, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002. 29 12 U.S. Code § 93(a). 30 12 U.S. Code § 1463. 31 Internal and External Audits, OCC, Version 1.1, 63 (July 2019), https://www.occ.gov/publications-and- resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/internal-external-audits/pub-ch-audits.pdf. 32 Id. 33 Id. 7
Pertinent OCC Enforcement Actions OCC is not limited to issuing mere guidance focused only on climate-related financial risks. Rather, OCC should take a more effective and authoritative route and issue comprehensive climate- and financial-risk regulations that banks and other financial institutions have to comply with. The agency possesses various “Enforcement Action Types” that would further its goals and policies by deterring those institutions from violating the regulations.34 For instance, 12 U.S.C. § 1818(b) allows OCC to issue Cease & Desist Orders or Personal Cease-and-Desist Orders to require banks or institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from an unsafe or unsound practice or violation and to take affirmative action to correct or remedy any conditions resulting from any violation or practice.35 OCC could push the banks to take affirmative action to correct or remedy any conditions resulting from any violation or unsafe or unsound practice through the issuance of restitution orders that could require banks to make restitution or provide reimbursement, indemnification, or guarantee against loss.36 Banks could be subject to Civil Money Penalty Orders, which consist of orders issued under 12 U.S.C. §1818(i), that require them to pay a monetary penalty.37 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured banks are subject to mandatory and discretionary restrictions and actions depending upon the bank’s Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) capital category.38 Technically, by issuing a PCA directive, OCC imposes discretionary restrictions and actions on the bank.39 Finally, OCC can serve banks a “Notice of Charges” (also referred to as “Notice of Assessment of Civil Money Penalty”) commencing litigation against the respondent banks when necessary.40 34 OCC, supra note 23. 35 Id. 36 Id. 37 Id. 38 Id. 39 Id. 40 Id. 8
II. OCC Must Enact Binding Regulations The proposed guidance acknowledges both the physical and transitional risks associated with climate change but fails to require banks to do anything to counteract these significant risks. The current proposal is only guidance – stating what banks should do – instead of a series of regulations that would ensure that banks monitor the environmental- and financial-related risks of their funding decisions. While this proposal is a step in the right direction, a mandatory binding rulemaking that forces banks to comply would better serve OCC’s goal of lowering a bank’s exposure to both physical and transitional risks. OCC has previously acknowledged that they have the authority to mandate banks’ compliance.41 OCC could utilize deterrents such as fines, civil penalties, or civil liability to enforce compliance. We ask OCC to deploy its full power to provide teeth to this set of principles by issuing binding regulations. Bank Resistance Although there are compliance costs associated with binding regulation, the benefits of reducing exposure to climate-related financial risks would far outweigh the cost.42 The proposed guidance suggests banks should take extra steps to monitor risks posed by climate change; however, the increased cost associated with the increased scrutiny may leave banks hesitant to comply. Similar to the implementation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, a bank’s internal costs could increase as a direct result of compliance. Banks would likely be averse to reducing their carbon footprint if there is no immediately evident benefit for them, especially if there is an up- front cost involved. The idea of managing risk is not a novel concept. Major banks already contain 41 Yevgeny Shrago, Fact Sheet: OCC Climate Guidance for Banks, PUB. CITIZEN https://www.citizen.org/article/fact-sheet-occ-climate-guidance-for-banks/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 42 Joseba Eceiza et al., Banking Imperatives for Managing Climate Risk, MCKINSEY (June 1, 2020), https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/banking-imperatives-for-managing- climate-risk. 9
robust risk management departments to monitor risks and hedge against uncertainty. Each bank has varying exposure to risks resulting from climate change and differing tolerances to risk, but it is undoubtedly in a bank’s best interest to analyze their profile.43 Regardless of their risk tolerances, a bank must understand their exposure to adequately manage their potential risk. Moreover, given the current “code red” moment for humanity and our warming planet, it behooves all federal agencies to vigorously regulate climate risks within their purview, and not avoid necessary regulation due to push-back by banks that are solely concerned about their short-term profits. Banks Should Manage Risks Related to Climate Change The main function of risk management is to protect a bank’s balance sheet from uncertainty.44 Banks have major exposure in industries with high transition risks, including energy, mining, water, transportation, and construction.45 A study conducted by consulting firm McKinsey and Company found that risks resulting from a changing climate could have “direct and indirect negative impact on banks, including an increase in stranded assets, uncertain residual values, and the potential loss of reputation.”46 Furthermore, these risks could potentially cause major losses. The McKinsey study presented an example of these risks by calculating the potential loss rate Miami-Dade County could experience as a direct result of rising sea levels. They concluded that severe flooding could lead to a loss rate of 2.53 percent, just lower than the 2.95 loss rate Miami experienced during the peak of 2008’s financial crisis.47 Additionally, if there is any external pressure from an economic slowdown, the rate could increase to as much as 7.25 percent loss.48 43 Michael S. Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask (Nov. 8, 2021), https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2021/pub-speech-2021-116.pdf. 44Eceiza, supra note 42. 45 Id. 46 Id. 47 Id. 48 Id. 10
Banks have substantial exposure to climate-related financial-risks that must be assessed and mitigated; further, if financial-related climate risks are left unmonitored it could open these institutions up to significant long-term losses.49 Mandatory regulations would ensure that banks consider these potential risks in their lending practices.50 Some of the largest banks have claimed to acknowledge these risks for years.51 Influential banks have claimed commitments to more sustainable banking including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Barclays. Barclays in particular claimed it is committed to managing both direct and indirect risks associated with climate change.52 Its central risk management department now includes a team solely dedicated to evaluating environmental risk.53 Further, the bank says it has taken steps to educate and train business and credit risk teams on the dangers of environmental risks.54 Barclays identified over 50 environmentally sensitive industries and created guidance documents to brief lending teams on the environmental risks these sectors pose, even requiring more stringent due diligence when evaluating the investment.55 Nevertheless, it is important to point out that while these banks claim they are moving in this direction, most have yet to take meaningful action. 49 Id. 50 Rainforest Action Network’s annual Banking on Climate Chaos report documents state that since the Paris Agreement and all these new bank promises, total fossil fuel financing has increased. 51 A growing number of banks have committed to be “net zero by 2050,” meaning that the net sum of their financed greenhouse gas emissions would be zero by 2050. Friends of the Earth International believes that “net zero by 2050” is a faulty approach due to methodological flaws, the exclusion of the full scope of emissions, reliance on unproven technologies and non-viable offsets, and postponement of action needed today, among other concerns. Friends of the Earth US believes a more viable approach is to curb bank financing of the most harmful projects immediately. For example, in the fossil fuel sector, Friends of the Earth US proposes the curbing of fossil fuel expansion projects immediately and phase out funding for other fossil fuels in line with the internationally accepted 1.5 °C warming target. 52 Environmental Risks in Lending, BARCLAYS, https://home.barclays/citizenship/the-way-we-do- business/environmental-risks-in-lending/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 53 Id. 54 Id. 55 Id. 11
Despite large banks stated commitments to reduce their climate impacts, a study conducted by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) found that, “… 2020 [financing] levels remained higher than in 2016, the year immediately following the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The overall fossil fuel financing trend of the last five years is still heading definitively in the wrong direction, reinforcing the need for banks to establish policies that lock in the fossil fuel financing declines….”56 While banks claim to make commitments to reduce their climate impacts, there has yet to be a discernable movement in that direction. A binding regulation from OCC will ensure all banks take effective measures toward assessing and minimizing both financial and climate risks. Although a few of the largest banks by asset size claim to have begun to move towards more sustainable practices, commercial market pressure is likely not enough to ensure they and other banks will fully acknowledge or mitigate environmental risks. Mandatory binding regulations are needed to compel all banks to act, and to ensure that the practices adopted by banks will be the most effective. McKinsey notes that “There are material risks on a ten-year horizon (not far beyond the average maturity of loan books), and transition risks are already becoming real, forcing banks, for example, to write off stranded assets.57 In addition to financial risks, environmental risks could lead to severe losses in the near future, making it banks’ best interest to also monitor these potential risks. III. Demands OCC should embrace the global wave and follow best International Models Mr. Hsu said in November that OCC’s guidance would be consistent with the principles discussed in international forums such as the Network for Greening the Financial System, a 56 RAINFOREST ACTION NETWORK, BANKING ON CLIMATE CHAOS: FOSSIL FUEL FINANCE REPORT (2021), https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Banking-on-Climate-Chaos-2021.pdf. 57 Eceiza, supra note 42. 12
network of central banks and financial supervisors.58 Mr. Hsu added that the guidelines would not be the agency’s final word on climate risk, and that the agency will continue to investigate various aspects of climate risk.59 As climate change is rapidly worsening, countries across the world have been working alongside to remedy the situation. An increasing number of central banks, the world’s most powerful financial institutions, say they want to be environmental stewards as well.60 Climate change, according to central banks, is both a financial and economic danger. Rising sea levels, increasing numbers of wildfires, and more powerful storms will result in shortages, which will lead to inflation, the regulators' traditional foe.61 Globally, the most committed banks are attempting to mitigate climate change by diverting their financial systems away from fossil fuels.62 Their restrictions may have an impact on American corporations doing business abroad. A long- term trend has developed with the frequency and costs of severe weather-related disasters increasing over the last two decades.63 Climate change, as well as other reasons such as greater economic development in high-risk locations, have contributed to this tendency.64 Event counts and total cost estimates reflect weather and climate disaster events with costs exceeding one billion in CPI-adjusted 2020 dollars.65 58 Dylan Tokar, U.S. Climate Risk Guidance Will Be in Line With Global Principles, Bank Regulator Says, WALL STREET J.

members, including central banks and regulators from key European countries, as well as China, Russia, and Japan.68 Some members are making policy changes in response to climate concerns, including as greater capital charges for lending to fossil-fuel businesses and bank stress tests that focus on the risk of rising temperatures to loan portfolios.69 Although the Bank of England’s own carbon footprint is infinitesimal compared to that of the banks OCC should be regulating, this bank began disclosing emissions from its physical activities in 2020, such as producing bank notes, the carbon footprint of its buildings and business travel.70 The Bank of England’s mandate has been expanded to encompass environmental sustainability in addition to price stability.71 The Bank of France has begun to calculate the costs of climate change. Because of the increased risk of droughts and flooding, a pilot climate stress test of banks and insurers indicated that the cost of insurance claims in parts of France could jump by as much as six times by 2050.72 Climate change has been already addressed by the European Central Bank's mandate, which controls monetary policy and bank regulation in the eurozone.73 The Bank for International Settlements, also known as the central bank for central banks, has a renewable energy financing program.74 The European Central Bank is assisting in the funding of this program.75 It is clear that the United States is lagging behind. 68 Michael S.

According to the central bank organization, regulators who ignore climate threats are failing in their duties.76 “If you have a financial stability mandate and you are not looking at climate then you are not fulfilling your mandate properly,” said Morgan Després, head of the secretariat of the Network for Greening the Financial System at the Bank of France in Paris.77 It is important to recognize the Federal Government’s desire to improve corporate disclosure of carbon emissions and climate risks. 78 But it is crucial to mention that it is past time to impose regulations on banks that will compel them to look beyond the models they have used to regulate financing and markets in the past.79 Without strong climate-related regulations, banks will simply maintain their current positions and defend fossil fuel investments. Climate change regulation is a global move that the U.S. must swiftly follow. From a financial perspective, climate change is already affecting the bottom lines for U.S. companies abroad; but from a scientific perspective, it is causing widespread, rapid, and intensifying global harm, some of which is now irreversible.80 This is an eye-opening moment for OCC to go beyond issuing mere guidance. Sarbanes Oxley Provides a Regulatory Model An alternative to OCC’s proposed guidance would be to model regulations after The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Even though the Sarbanes Oxley Act is an act of Congress, its framework could be adopted by OCC while issuing a binding regulation that forces banks to address both climate-related financial risks as well as financial-related climate risks. SOX mandates controls and practices to ensure the reliability of financial reports of public companies 76 Clark, supra note 11. 77 Nick J. Adam, Central Banks Jump Into Climate-Change Policy Fray, TECHILIVE, (May 17, 2021), https://techilive.in/central-banks-jump-into-climate-change-policy-fray/. 78 Clark, supra note 11. 79 Id. 80IPCC Report:‘Code Red’ for Human Driven Global Heating, Warns UN Chief, UN (Aug. 9, 2021), https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362.

that could impact investing practices. The process controls and public reporting requirements sanctioned by the act could be mirrored in OCC’s effort to require banks to acknowledge environmental risks associated with their financing. Moreover, SOX provides guidelines for compliance of corporate directors and officers, including civil liability and criminal penalties. These guidelines could readily be transitioned into the context of environmental risk management. A reasonable suggestion would be to mirror the internal controls required by §404 of The Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.81 Sarbanes Oxley §404 mandates publicly traded companies to file an annual report with the Securities Exchange Commission; the report must be certified by the company’s officers and attested to by external auditors. The act requires management to “establish and maintain an adequate internal control structures” and to assess the effectiveness of those controls. Although the controls mandated by Sarbanes Oxley revolve around financial reporting, OCC could introduce a similar control system to require banks to acknowledge environmental risks associated with their financing practices. Banks Must Submit Environmental Risk Assessments to OCC A major requirement of Sarbanes Oxley is the submission of an annual report with the SEC. Prior to the enaction of SOX, the trustworthiness of financial reports had deteriorated – specifically in wake of the Enron Scandal – and there was significant evidence that companies were manipulating earnings.82 Former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt highlighted the problem stating “we are witnessing an erosion in the quality of earnings, and therefore, the quality of financial reporting. Managing may be giving way to manipulation; integrity may be losing out to illusion.”83 81 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (116 Stat. 745). 82 Murdock, Sarbanes Oxley Five Years Later: Hero or Villain, 39 LYUCHILJ 525, 558 (2008). 83 Id. (quoting Arthur Levitt, Chairman, SEC, The “Numbers Game,” Remarks at the N.Y.U. Center for Law and Business (Sept. 28, 1998)). 17
This problem has become less rampant following the implementation of SEC reporting, mainly due to the officer’s attestation as officers could be subject to fines or imprisonment. A similar approach could be imposed on banks to mandate their compliance in the management of risks resulting from and contributing to climate change. This area is currently unregulated, and banks have free reign to make investments without regard to the financial or environmental risks associated with their decisions. This is analogous to financial reporting prior to Sarbanes Oxley, as corporate directors and officers can make decisions without accountability. The implementation of a similar reporting system to Sarbanes Oxley would provide more accountability, as OCC could require banks to acknowledge the role that climate change plays for both financial and environmental risks associated with their practices. If OCC notices that a bank has failed to comply, they would be able to utilize their broad powers to impose fines or otherwise deter these practices. These deterrents could include but are not limited to civil liability and criminal penalties for management who signs off on a fraudulent report. IV. Banks must specifically analyze and disclose their contribution to deforestation as an environmental risk Deforestation is a significant contributor to climate change globally, and as part of the climate-related risk governance framework, banks must recognize and incorporate the significant risks associated with financing companies connected to deforestation.84 U.S. banks and financial institutions actively fund companies involved in deforestation and land degradation through debt 84 Deforestation is not the only activity in which banks participate that has impacts on the climate. Large banks also directly finance fossil fuel production such as coal, oil, and gas. See David Tong, Unused Tools: How Central Banks Are Fueling the Climate Crisis, OIL CHANGE INTL. (2021), http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2021/08/central_bank_report_A4_v08.pdf; RAINFOREST ACTION NETWORK, BANKING ON CLIMATE CHAOS: FOSSIL FUEL FINANCE REPORT (2021), https://www.ran.org/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/Banking-on-Climate-Chaos-2021.pdf. 18
and equity financing and make billions in interest, dividends, and fees in the process.85 These companies produce, trade, or use soft commodities like soy, beef, and palm oil which are mass produced using destructive methods. The production of agricultural commodities in the developing world — including soy, palm, timber, cocoa, pulp & paper and cattle — contribute to deforestation and climate change in multiple ways. First, tropical agriculture is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions.86.If tropical deforestation were a country, it would be the third largest emitter in the world.87 Forests hold more carbon than humans have emitted for the past 30 years through fossil fuel use. However, deforestation now accounts for roughly 8% of global emissions,88 and converting forests into farmland is the number one cause.89 Second, farming activities (including plowing and irrigation) and inputs (such as fertilizer and fuel) also produce emissions. This accounts for another 11% of global emissions. Finally, forests act as a carbon sink and help mitigate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Deforestation reduces the amount of carbon that the world’s forests can remove from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. In the 1990s, intact tropical forests removed around 46 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere, a total of 17% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the decade. This figure decreased to 6% of emissions during the subsequent decade in part because tropical forests are shrinking. One recent study from 2017 estimated that forests could mitigate over a third of the total carbon needed to limit global temperature rise to only 2° Celsius by 2030.90 85 Deforestation Dividends: How global banks profit from rainforest destruction and human rights abuses, GLOB.

If historical trends continue, we stand to lose another 131.21 million hectares of standing forest cover over the next 30 years, an area approximately the size of Peru. Virtually all the scientific models for meeting the Paris goals require achieving zero net deforestation by 2030. Furthermore, most deforestation in the developing world linked to internationally traded commodities is illegal (violates local law) and connected to organized crime.91 Companies that contribute to deforestation span across all stages of the supply chain, “from those managing plantations, to commodity traders, processors and manufacturers, and retailers across a wide sector of industries from food to cosmetics.”92 Banks and financial institutions expose themselves to deforestation risks through financing these companies.93 Complex supply chains and commodity aggregation impose traceability challenges, which make it difficult to parse out the companies involved in deforestation. However, initiatives to improve monitoring and traceability have developed technology to link companies and banking institutions to deforestation risks. For example, Trase Finance is a “data-driven transparency initiative” that maps supply chains and financing of tropical commodities like beef, soy, and palm oil.94 It provides accessible online tools to the public to reveal how commodity exports, companies, and financial institutions are linked to deforestation. Trase Finance reveals that asset managers like Vanguard Group hold shares in commodity traders of soy and palm oil exposed to significant deforestation risks.95 In fact, Trase Finance shows that Vanguard had the highest exposure to 91 Illegal Agriculture Is the Main Reason We’re Still Losing Forests.

Brazilian Soy deforestation risk of all US financial institutions in 2018 through equity holdings.96 Forests & Finance is another initiative that allows the public to search for the top investors and creditors financing tropical commodity production linked to deforestation by region.97 A deep dive into Forests & Finance reveals that JP Morgan Chase bank was the top American creditor funding the production of risky tropical commodities in 2021.98 These initiatives show that there is a growing public pressure and demand for transparency and accountability from companies and financial institutions with regard to their connection to deforestation. The risks from deforestation threaten our global financial system The physical risks associated with deforestation present a direct danger to the global financial system. Biodiversity loss and climate change present major sustainability challenges for investors, and deforestation is directly linked to both.99 The US economy relies heavily on tropical commodities, and rainfall in crucial agricultural regions of Texas and Mexico is affected by the Amazon rainforest.100 In fact, fifty percent of the world’s GDP relies on nature and ecosystem services affected by deforestation, and a loss in services like pollination and wild fisheries could lead to a $2.7 trillion decline in global GDP by 2030. 101 The increasing government, shareholder, and public understanding of the US banking system’s role in deforestation and climate change presents legal and reputational risks for banks. Changing consumer sentiment and public pressure by environmental organizations on banks to discontinue funding deforestation will impose reputational risks, and there have already been 96 The Vanguard Group, Inc., TRASE, https://trase.finance/financiers/4903b402-a3e4-3beb-a0b6-deab6df9b5bc (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 97 Finance’s Role in Deforestation, FORESTS & FIN., https://forestsandfinance.org/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 98 Data Deep Dive, FORESTS & FIN., https://forestsandfinance.org/data/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 99Sustainable Land Use, PRINCIPLES FOR RESP.

public initiatives to make this funding more transparent. Legal risks may also arise as new legislation requiring climate-related financial disclosures link companies to their impacts on deforestation, climate change, and the financial institutions that fund them. Especially as the environmental and human rights abuses associated with deforestation and the enormous profits banks have made through funding these operations come to light. This is so because the increased scrutiny of environmental and human rights abuses draws more public attention to the need to reform the sector generally. In fact, congress has already started taking action. In October of 2021, three members of Congress introduced the federal FOREST Act – a bipartisan bill that provides the Federal government with tools to deter commodity-driven illegal deforestation and directly addresses the impact of the U.S. market on global deforestation.102 This demonstrates that there is increasing concern taken on by members of congress to address deforestation, and highlights the growing risk associated with investments linked to deforestation. The first known case of a bank being held accountable for its damaging lending practices arose in 2020.103 The Australian bank ANZ agreed to compensate land-grabbing victims with the profits made from a $40 million loan it granted to a sugar company after it forcibly removed them from their land in Cambodia to build a sugar plantation. Although ANZ acknowledged its inadequate due diligence before funding the project, it maintained that it was not legally liable for the damages arising out of the project.104 Test cases for financial sector accountability have started to appear across the world with the filing of claims against banks for the environmental and human rights abuses that result from 102 FOREST Act Bill, https://www.schatz.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/forest_act.pdf; Brian Schatz U.S. Senator for Hawai’i press release on the FOREST Act, https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-blumenauer- unveil-new-bipartisan-legislation-to-help-stop-illegal-deforestation-around-the-world-fight-climate-change. 103 GLOB.

the projects they finance. One case was filed against the Dutch Bank ING in 2019 by campaign groups through an OECD complaint mechanism.105 Another complaint was brought jointly by Friends of the Earth Australia and Australian bush-fire victims against ANZ bank under OECD guidelines.106 The complaint targets ANZ’s failure to adhere to Paris Agreement reduction targets through its lending practices and for violating the Paris Agreement guidelines by not disclosing “the full extent of its lending emissions.”107 Although complaints brought to the OECD are non- judicial, they bring attention to the issue and can influence future legal action.108 However, cases against banks have also been brought to courts. A case was brought against the Dutch Development bank HMO in Dutch courts by the Civil Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) for funding a hydroelectric dam project in Honduras that appropriated land held sacred by the indigenous Lenca people.109 In China, there is an ongoing case brought by an NGO against two Chinese banks for the environmental harm caused by their loans to a pig farm that dumped raw sewage into the Han river.110 The Chinese government has also begun investigating ways to hold lenders liable for environmental harm and is studying the legal systems in other countries to set its own requirements. 111 Rather than funding this devastating industry, U.S. Banks should participate in initiatives to stop deforestation Governments, companies, and financial institutions throughout the world have publicly acknowledged and pledged to take action against deforestation, showing that they are aware of the systemic risks posed by the production of commodities related to deforestation. Still, there is very 105 Id. 106Bushfire Survivors Launch Claim Against ANZ Under International Law for Financing Climate Change, FRIENDS OF THE EARTH AUSTL.

little accountability associated with voluntary pledges. As a result of the World Leader’s Summit at COP26 in 2021, 141 countries covering around 91% of the world’s forests have committed to stop deforestation and begin the reversal process by 2030 through sustainable land use practices, conservation, and forest restoration.112 Additionally, over 30 financial institutions endorsed a statement in November 2021 pledging to “use best efforts to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation activities at the companies in [their] investment portfolios and financing activities by 2025.”113 However, 72% of the 350 largest companies involved in driving deforestation and the 150 leading financial institutions that finance them do not have policies in place recognizing the risks of these problematic commodities.114 And while only 11 out of the 28 companies that published a new commitment since 2021 include a deforestation commitment for the commodities they are exposed to, many companies with commitments fail to explain how they are implementing them.115 In 2010, the Consumer Goods Forum, representing some of the world’s largest companies, pledged to help achieve “zero-net” deforestation in their supply chain by 2020.116 Notwithstanding the much lower commitment of “zero-net” deforestation versus zero deforestation, none of the companies met their goal and many did not even try.117 112 UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONF.

Voluntary pledges are not enough to address climate risks We can’t rely on voluntary pledges and loose guidelines to achieve progress in eliminating deforestation and reducing the risks of climate change to our financial system. The reality is that the banking sector profits enormously from financing deforestation and will continue to do so absent public policy designed to stop it. American banks are not currently bound by mandatory regulations or real legal consequences for their environmentally harmful lending and investment practices. Large banks face an overwhelming lack of accountability which means they have little incentive to take real action in preventing their contribution to deforestation and climate change. Foreign governments have already acknowledged the need for mandatory legislation and regulation to hold banks and companies accountable. In the EU and the UK, legislation is being developed that will require companies “to undertake due diligence on deforestation risk in their supply chains,” and there is mounting pressure “to extend similar requirements to financial institutions.”118 In 2017, France enacted its “Duty of Vigilance” law which requires businesses and banks to “identify, mitigate, and prevent human rights abuses and environmental harms.”119 Again, it remains clear that the United States is lagging too far behind. Environmentally-conscious American banks are far fewer in number, but do exist. These are smaller, regional or specialized banks that acknowledge the environmental impact of investment choices and take care to avoid funding projects that harm the environment. Some of these banks are certified B Corporations, which means they can measure their “entire social and environmental impact.”120 Others are members of the Global Alliance for Banking on Values (GABV), which is “a network of independent banks using finance to deliver sustainable economic, 118 GLOB. WITNESS, supra note 85. 119 GLOB. WITNESS, supra note 85. 120Measuring a Company’s Entire Social and Environmental Impact, B CORP., https://www.bcorporation.net/en- us/certification/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 25
social and environmental development.”121 These banks’ successful business models – which include operating ethically and transparently – are placed in jeopardy by their big bank competitors, who profit greatly by investing without added responsibilities.122 The current OCC draft principles are not effective because they do not specifically require that bank management recognize and incorporate the climate risks associated with deforestation and the banks’ own role in facilitating deforestation through its funding activities. If OCC aims to mitigate the risk of climate change to the banking sector it must not only recognize the impacts of climate change on financial risk, but also the impact of the banking sector on climate change. OCC must therefore integrate the deforestation risks of banking activity into the risk governance framework for climate change risks to be meaningfully captured. It should require that financial institutions recognize deforestation as a material climate risk and prioritize deforestation as a criteria impacting financing decisions. It should also mandate banks to analyze and publicly disclose the extent to which they contribute to deforestation. Ultimately, OCC should include a requirement that banks identify their debt and equity financing practices that fund deforestation, and to discontinue these practices. V. To Implement Broad Policy Regarding Climate Change, OCC Must Undergo and Implement a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement. Programmatic reviews under the implementing regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are indispensable to implementing broad proposals or planning-level decisions within agencies.123 “Programmatic NEPA reviews assess the environmental impacts of proposed 121 GLOB. ALL. FOR BANKING ON VALUES, https://www.gabv.org/ (last visited Feb. 12, 2022). 122 Ella Nilsen, The Smartest Way to Finance Clean Energy That You’ve Never Heard of, VOX (Jun. 1, 2021), https://www.vox.com/2021/6/1/22454779/green-banks-biden-american-jobs-plan. 123 40 C.F.R. §§ 1500-1508 (2020) (implementing the goals set by Congress in 42 U.S.C. §§ 4331-4347). 26
policies, plans, programs, or projects for which subsequent actions will be implemented.”124 The level of detail in a Programmatic NEPA review is sufficient to allow informed decision-making at the planning stage and leads to development of broad mitigation strategies.125 To fully and adequately address and mitigate climate change-related risks, including those risks posed by deforestation, a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) should be prepared by OCC. Using a PEIS will allow OCC to examine the interaction among proposed actions and to assess cumulative effects of its decisions, including “no action” alternatives, on deforestation and other climate change-related decisions.126 Further, federal courts have often agreed that the use of a PEIS is beneficial to an agency in making long-term, policy-based decisions, enforcing the concept that a PEIS would prove essential to OCC in creating regulations as it proceeds with climate change-related risk mitigation. Utilization of a Programmatic EIS is beneficial for implementing broad policy changes or rulemakings Under the Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) 1978 regulations implementing NEPA, Programmatic review via a PEIS or Programmatic Environmental Assessment (PEA), is best utilized when an agency expects to make broad policy changes or planning-level decisions.127 Programmatic reviews set out the broad, general view of environmental impacts and benefits of a proposed decision or policy.128 As described by CEQ, Programmatic review for repetitive agency activities can “provide a starting point for analyzing direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts” of environmental issues related to broad resolutions.129 Programmatic NEPA reviews, including 124 COUNCIL ON ENV’T. QUALITY, MEMORANDUM: EFFECTIVE USE OF PROGRAMMATIC NEPA REVIEWS 7 (2014). (Council on Environmental Quality hereinafter, CEQ) 125 What is the Difference Between a PEIS and Project-Level EIS?, WASH.

creation of PEISs are governed under the same regulations and guidance which apply to project or site-specific NEPA analyses130. Within the past ten years, legislation trends have encouraged agencies to apply programmatic approaches in NEPA reviews.131 Programmatic NEPA reviews, including use of a PEIS, aid in influencing the nature of subsequent decisions through a tiered approach, allowing for integrated policy or planning framework. After the agency establishes a PEIS to implement policy or rule-making objectives, later tiers in the NEPA process may be tailored to conform to the PEIS analysis to allow narrower investigation into a specific project or issue. In fact, after a PEIS is employed, a more comprehensive picture of the consequences of multiple proposed actions may become clear.132 A PEIS may also be used to “support policy- and planning-level decisions when there are limitations in available information and uncertainty regarding the timing, location, and environmental impacts of subsequent implementing actions(s).”133 The initial use of a PEIS that adequately examines the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a policy, plan, or proposed program could establish parameters for subsequent analyses falling within the scope of the initial PEIS.134 The use of a PEIS can further advance the nation’s environmental policy as articulated in Section 101 of NEPA, by promoting sustainability and incorporating comprehensive mitigation planning to address impacts on a broad programmatic scale.135 130 See 40 C.F.R. §§ 1502.4(b)-(c)(1978); 40 C.F.R. § 1502.4(b)(2020) (The use of Programmatic review is embedded within the CEQ Regulations that address analyses of “broad actions” and the tiering process.). 131 CEQ, supra note 124, at 4 (citing MAP-21 Section 1305, Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 § 1040). 132 CEQ, supra note 124, at 10. 133 Id. at 11. 134 Id. 135 Id. at 34-35. 28
The 1978 and 2020 changes to CEQ’s Regulations for the Implementation of NEPA Friends of the Earth US acknowledges that NEPA regulations are currently in flux. On July 16, 2020, CEQ issued a final rule rewriting the entirety of its 1978 regulations implementing NEPA (2020 revised regulations).136 More than an update, the 2020 revised regulations upended virtually every aspect of NEPA and its longstanding practices, contradicting decades of court interpretations of NEPA’s mandates and undercutting the reliance placed on NEPA by the public, decision- makers, and project proponents. The 2020 revised regulations limited the scope of actions to which NEPA applies, eviscerated the thorough environmental analysis that lies at the heart of the statute, reduced the ability of the public to participate in federal agency decision-making, and sought to limit judicial review of agency NEPA compliance. All told, the 2020 revised regulations frustrate Congress’s manifest intent in enacting NEPA and threaten human health and the environment. As such, the 2020 revised regulations are facially invalid and the subject of multiple ongoing legal challenges.137 CEQ is in the middle of a two-phase process for reinstating and expanding upon the 1978 implementing regulations, which will have the effect of voiding the 2020 revised regulations.138 To that end, no agency, including OCC, should apply the 2020 revised regulations. Until the pending CEQ regulations are finalized, OCC must rely on the longstanding 136 Update to the Regulations Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 85 Fed. Reg. 43304 (July 16, 2020) (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 1500). 137 See Alaska Cmty. Action on Toxics v. Council on Env’t. Quality, 3:20-cv-5199 (N.D. Cal. filed July 29, 2020) (Environmental groups filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Northern District of California challenging the CEQ’s amendments to NEPA regulations. The plaintiffs asserted that CEQ should have prepared an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement under the existing regulations to evaluate the amendments’ impacts, including environmental justice impacts and impacts on efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to evaluate how a changing climate affects proposed projects. Plaintiffs also asserted that CEQ failed to comply with NEPA and/or the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to review environmental justice impacts, by violating standards that apply to agency decision-making, by promulgating rules that are contrary to the plain language and purpose of NEPA, and by invalidly attempting to amend statutory thresholds for judicial review.). 138 See CEQ NEPA Regulations, NEPA.GOV, https://ceq.doe.gov/laws-regulations/regulations.html (last visited Feb. 6, 2022). 29
and unchallenged regulations that properly implement NEPA and dictate the agency’s actions in this instance. OCC should conduct a PEIS to implement broad policy or rulemaking to mitigate climate change-related risk To best identify and mitigate “weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate” and produce meaningful obligations for banks to “develop capabilities, deploy resources, and make necessary investments to address climate-related financial risks,” OCC must conduct a PEIS to implement broad policy.139 As addressed in 40 CFR § 1508.1(q)(3)(i-iv) (“Major Federal Actions”), an agency may use Programmatic NEPA review in a decision to adopt official policy or formal plans which result in or substantially alter agency programs, or guide or constrain alternative uses of Federal resources, upon which future agency actions will be based.140 A PEIS performed by OCC would enable the agency to implement broad policy to mitigate the impact of climate change on banks, as well as enable banks to make decisions to mitigate climate change-related risk from the outset. By conducting a PEIS, OCC could use the information generated by the analysis to inform subsequent decisions on investment or financial backing. For example, the use of a PEIS would enable OCC and banks to evaluate whether further investment in agricultural commodities is wise in the face of financed-based climate risk.141 A PEIS would start the process for OCC to mitigate investments in climate-adverse industries at the outset of consideration, and subsequently, related projects could follow suit. 139 OCC, OCC-2021-0023, PRINCIPLES FOR CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR LARGE BANKS 1 (2021). 140 As cited in the 2020 CEQ Regulations. In the 1978 CEQ Regulations the definition of “Major Federal Action” is cited at 40 CFR § 1508.18(b). 141Money to Burn, GLOBAL WITNESS (Sept. 23 2019), https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/forests/money- to-burn-how-iconic-banks-and-investors-fund-the-destruction-of-the-worlds-largest-rainforests/. 30
Through a Programmatic NEPA review that contains sufficient discussion of relevant issues and viewpoints, OCC must take a “hard look” at the environmental effects of the proposed action(s) and make a reasoned choice amongst available alternatives.142 The affected environment in a PEIS may be broadly described and impacts, though temporal, may be discussed with emphasis on cumulative effects.143 As such, OCC should take a “hard look” at the cumulative impacts of its decisions on climate change and climate change-related risk by conducting a PEIS. OCC should conduct a PEIS for climate change-related risk issues as federal courts have held the process is a valid step to implementing broad policy Federal courts look favorably on Programmatic NEPA reviews. The PEIS is recognized by federal courts, which hold them as valuable for analyzing broad environmental impacts. Programmatic NEPA reviews addressing broad, cumulative impacts have been upheld in several circuits. As these courts find PEIS and other programmatic NEPA reviews a valid interpretation of CEQ’s regulations, OCC should further endeavor to conduct a PEIS to analyze the cumulative impacts of its decisions in a step toward implementing broad policy on climate change-related risk. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has characterized a PEIS as “reflecting the broad environmental consequences attendant upon a wide-ranging federal program” and as “look[ing] ahead and assimilat[ing] broad issues relevant to the program.”144 The court also noted that CEQ regulations state that a PEIS should be prepared if actions are “connected, cumulative, or sufficiently similar” and that a PEIS is the best feasible method to assess the combined impacts of similar actions.145 142 NRDC v. Morton, 458 F.2d 827, 838 (D.C. Cir. 1972). 143 CEQ, supra note 124, at 33. 144 Nevada v. Dept. of Energy, 457 F.3d 78, 92 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Found. on Econ. Trends v. Heckler, 756 F.2d 143, 159 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). 145 Nevada, 458 F.2d at 92. 31
When evaluating a PEIS in regard to large scale development, the Eastern District of Tennessee found Tennessee Valley Authority’s use of a PEIS to evaluate changes in vegetation management policies over a large region an appropriate use of the NEPA mechanism.146 The court made clear that a PEIS “may be required when several proposals could have a ‘cumulative or synergistic’ impact within a region.”147 Additionally, the court held that the preparation of a PEIS does not relieve an agency from later preparation of specific action review, but that the general discussions in the PEIS may later be referenced through the tiering process.148 The Ninth Circuit enforced the concept that a PEIS need not include detailed site or action-specific analysis, especially for those providing broad guidelines and no irreversible commitment of resources.149 Most recently, the Arizona District Court visited the concept of the PEIS, in discussing “programmatic attacks” under the APA. The court reiterated that a PEIS is appropriate when actions are “connected, cumulative, or similar.”150 Consequently, as climate change-related risk is the result of “connected, cumulative, or similar” actions via investment or otherwise, OCC should conduct a PEIS adhering to the scope determined by the federal courts. Conclusion Friends of the Earth applauds OCC for acknowledging the impact banks have on global climate and for taking initial steps to hold banks accountable for their actions. But OCC should and must do more to prevent catastrophic outcomes for the environment and our financial system. For all the aforementioned reasons, OCC must undergo a comprehensive rulemaking process, 146 Sherwood v. TVA, No. 12-CV-156, 2021 WL 3276373, at *17-18 (E.D. Tenn.

Respectfully Submitted, ___________________________________ Jeff Conant Senior International Forests Program Manager Friends of the Earth US ___________________________________ Doug Norlen Director, Economic Policy Program Friends of the Earth US 33","Friends of the Earth US, a non-profit organization, submitted comments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regarding its principles for managing climate-related financial risks for large banks. The organization argues that the OCC's current non-binding guidance is insufficient and calls for mandatory, enforceable regulations to ensure banks account for both the impact of climate change on their financing and the impact of their financing on the climate. They emphasize the need for banks to integrate climate risks into their risk management frameworks and stress the importance of binding regulations over mere guidance. The comment also highlights the role of deforestation in climate change and urges banks to assess and disclose their contributions to deforestation.

Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, D.C. 20219 Via File Upload to https://regulations.gov/ Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 – Public consultation on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Comptroller Hsu, Thank you for soliciting feedback on the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. Please accept these comments on behalf of Atmos Financial, PBC (“Atmos”). Atmos is a financial technology banking services provider, founded in 2020 with the express purpose of using the power of banking to address the climate crisis. We engage with the banking sector in multiple ways. Specifically, we aggregate deposits from consumers interested in growing a low-carbon economy, and facilitate banks to engage in scalable, low-interest climate-positive loan programs. As a party to lending arrangements with banks subject to OCC regulation, we benefit from regulations that factor climate risk into their risk management practices. We would first like to thank the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for designing these Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We also congratulate the OCC for sharing “Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask.” We agree with the OCC that addressing weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control potential climate-related financial risks is critical to ensuring the safety and soundness of U.S. banks and the global financial system. Below please find our comments in response to some of your specific questions related to the proposed principles. Page 1 of 14
Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? We agree with the OCC that all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks. While we understand that the OCC has designed these proposed principles to initially target banks with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets (i.e., the largest banks), we believe that the existential threat posed by climate change necessitates extending the application of these principles to all US Banks, irrespective of asset size, location, or business model. Climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets, posing grave threats to all banks with increasing frequency and severity. According to NOAA, in 2021 there were 20 separate weather and climate disaster events where losses per event exceeded $1 billion: 688 people lost their lives due to climate-related disasters, and the total financial cost in the United States was more than $145 billion. More importantly, we know these losses will only continue to increase until and unless meaningful action is taken to dramatically reduce emissions in line with science-based targets. These acute and progressive physical risks have the potential to seriously disrupt the stability of the banking system and the communities they serve. For example, in 2021 more than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters and more than 80 percent of Americans experienced a heat wave. Climate impacts are already manifesting in the largest state economies. In just the last few years, our home state of California has experienced record-breaking wildfires, in both number and size, that have taken hundreds of lives, bankrupted our largest utility, left millions regularly without power and brought home insurability into question. Given the lack of significant change in economic systems to materially reduce emissions, these physical risks are certain to increase in frequency and severity in the years to come. We are increasingly concerned that banks that engage in mortgage lending in disaster prone areas may not be sufficiently monitoring the increased likelihood of mortgage defaults after climate disasters. For example, mortgages in Hurricane Harvey FEMA designated counties saw a significant increase in 90+ day delinquency when compared to delinquency rates just six months prior. Within FEMA designated counties, properties estimated to have damage saw a 205% increase in 90+ day delinquency, while properties estimated to have no damage saw a Page 2 of 14
167% increase in 90+ day delinquency.1 In a worst case scenario multiple disasters occurring nearly simultaneously across different parts of the country can create billions of dollars of damages and cumulative losses. This scenario occured in 2018 where 15 named Hurricanes hit the United States causing over $50 billion in damages in the same 6 month period that the Camp Fire in California that caused over $16 billion in losses. Already, insurance is not a guaranteed mitigator for the costs of these risks. As insurance companies begin to pull coverage from areas that face higher risk of wildfires, an increasing number of homes are likely to be designated as uninsurable. Where the science is unmistakable about the likelihood of the increased frequency and intensity of weather events, and it is foreseeable that billions of dollars property stand in harm's way, cascading mortgage delinquencies and potentially defaults could destabilize certain financial institutions without appropriate risk management strategies. Furthermore, the foreseeable risks to property will require clear language for climate related underwriting, collateral and risk standards while ensuring compliance with fair lending laws. In short, climate risk is an existential threat which poses an emerging and increasing threat to U.S. financial stability. Climate risk potentially poses the greatest threat to smaller banks located in higher-risk communities, compared to large banks and smaller banks in climate-resilient geographies. Nevertheless, because climate impact is not geographically contained, and is instead a phenomenon that is caused by and impacts each of us in various parts of the global supply chain, it is appropriate that regulatory guidance be applied across the entire industry. We therefore urge the OCC to extend its Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management to all US banks. We also encourage the OCC to make some or all of these principles prescriptive, rather than voluntary best practices. Using its authority under 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1, we believe OCC can finalize this guidance and enforce it as a mandatory requirement, while creating size- and risk-based milestones that appease those opposed to such regulation. After these guidelines are finalized, the OCC should continue to create even more in-depth requirements. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other foreign financial regulatory agencies are already taking similar steps, and we encourage you to make use of the 1See Kousky, Palim & Pan,(2020) ”Flood Damage and Mortgage Credit Risk: A Case Study of Hurrican Harvey,” Journal of Housing Research, 29:sup1, S86-S120, DOI:10.1080/10527001.2020.1840131Also see Amy Gromwoski,“The Impact of Natural Disaster on Mortgage Delinquency,”CoreLogic, September 2018, available at https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/the-impact-of-natural-catastrophe-on-mortgage-delinquency/; Page 3 of 14
data they are collecting in this process. We also encourage you, wherever possible, to conform US principles and guidance to meet international goals and standards. Acknowledging the cost and burden such guidelines may have on smaller banks, we suggest the OCC implement a staggered timeline to provide smaller banks ample time to incorporate an applicable implementation strategy. A timeline could be determined based on size- and risk-based milestones derived by the OCC. Providing such broad guidance now with ample implementation time will result in the emergence of qualified vendors to ease the capital and knowledge burden for smaller banks to meet these principles. Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? We suggest detailed guidance be provided for all banks to perform a preliminary self-assessment of their own exposure to climate-related financial risk and submit that assessment to the OCC for review. The OCC should provide detailed prescriptive guidance to expand existing risk criteria as a part of periodic self assessments that take into account geographic exposure, scope of operations, and time frames as developed in coordination with FSOC partners. Audit and assurance firms may be able to effectively aid banks in making these assessments though should not be relied upon. Providing simple, but detailed guidance about how banks should undertake climate related risk management modeling would be an important first step. Once banks report the results of these self assessments, the OCC can exercise its oversight authority by tailoring its climate related risk requirements to ensure that data and modeling approaches are uniform and provide the information needed to assess whether more explicit standards are needed. Results of each bank’s self-assessment, reviewable and requiring approval from the OCC, should dictate the timeline under which climate-related financial risk management practices need to be adopted for formal ongoing reporting. Banks with the lowest potential climate-related risk, which likely include smaller banks in less impacted geographies, would be granted the most amount of time to begin formally reporting based on OCC dictated climate-related financial risk management practices. The largest banks should be required to meet the earliest possible Page 4 of 14
deadline due to the systemic impact of their potential exposure and so that such learnings may be applied to smaller banks around the country. Banks will independently assess the increased risks associated with OCC guidance and incorporate such risks into their capital, loan pricing and credit allocation decisions going forward. As banks make such determinations independently, they may find it helpful to have options to unwind “stranded assets” as a result of the physical risks of the climate-related economic transition. As the OCC reviews such options, financial aid should be limited to legacy assets only. Limiting financial aid to assets constructed before a determined date will ensure banks don’t abuse such resources for their own financial gain at the expense of society and climate risk at large. Atmos also recommends that future guidance for banks and bank holding companies involved in the trading and marketing of non-renewable commodities (including physical energy commodities and physical energy commodity derivatives) include a requirement to disclose the impact of climate-related risk drivers (including operational risk) around these products and services. Appropriate disclosures will ensure stakeholders are sufficiently warned of value fluctuation of the bank or bank holding company based on exposure to such commodities. General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Many banks currently lack sufficient knowledge-capital to assess climate-related financial risks. Guidance by the OCC directing banks to perform self-assessments would need to be sufficient and simple enough to be made applicable to all banks. Enabling a tiered implementation timeline incorporating factors like bank size, risk-profile, geographic exposure, etc. will ensure that banks that wield the greatest influence over the safety and soundness of the US economy are carrying the greatest burden related to the adoption of such practices. Analogous to the relationship between Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the International Accounting Standards Board, all efforts should be made to conform Principles for Page 5 of 14
Climate-Related Financial Risk Management to internationally driven guidance. Implementing two sets of similar but different guidance will increase the implementation burden and complexity of reporting for large banks in particular operating across regulatory jurisdictions. Below are listed various challenges banks are currently encountering. ● In some cases, banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, or the most relevant scenarios do not provide sufficient detail in some areas critical to financial institutions. ● Climate models are continually being adjusted, while the associated risks to banks and bank holding companies are not updated continuously to incorporate the changing risks to their portfolio holdings. ● Banks’ internal risk departments have no immediate background in assessing climate risk and are not sufficiently informed to make risk-based calls without more prescriptive scientific background. ● Banks may have an imperfect understanding of the risks associated with non-asset based commercial loans, derived from imperfect information provided by portfolio companies. The anticipated plans for the Securities and Exchange Commission to propose climate disclosure for public companies should have a beneficial impact for all banks to gain more comprehensive and consistent information from their large clients. ● Banks may not be fully undertaking a geographic based assessment of their exposure to derivative instruments including mortgage back securities and collateralized debt obligations originated for areas of the country that are particularly vulnerable to the increased physical impacts of climate change, like wildfires, hurricanes and sea level rise, under climate risk scenario modeling. In addition to the technical challenges above, banks may face increasing challenges of managing the potential volatility in the costs of capital or liquidity as climate related financial risks manifest across sectors. Many of these challenges are market-driven and should be permitted to take effect to accelerate change across sectors more broadly but must be monitored and managed to ensure stability across financial institutions as the transition unfolds. The OCC should also make clear that having a transition plan is a crucial part of a bank’s risk management system, and provide guidance as to how these plans should be formed. Current Risk Management Practices Page 6 of 14
4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? N/A 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? It is our understanding that banks are just beginning to incorporate greater review by the board and/or management as it relates to climate-related financial risks. However, review is largely still qualitative and discussion-based while a quantified review of risk and materiality assessment has not been broadly adopted. However, much can be learned from the recent European Central Bank (ECB) economy-wide climate stress tests methodology and results. There the results revealed that climate risks are concentrated in certain regions and sectors. Furthermore, testing revealed that some 70% of loan exposures of euro area banks that are subject to future physical hazards are concentrated in the hands of only 25 banks.2 With a lack of guidance from regulatory bodies, relative to other prioritized issues, there may be a false perception that such risks are likely not near-term nor material enough to warrant an immediate review and policy change. Such perceptions may lead to imprudent financial risk taking that imperils the long-term stability of the financial sector in the absences of regulatory guidance. 6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? It is our understanding that banks generally are not considering climate-related financial risks with time horizons longer than five years. The short-term view of banks broadly is contrary to international goals for addressing the existential threats posed by the climate crisis. In 2020, Ceres produced a report highlighting the risk due to transition risks of the largest banks. In 2021, Ceres prepared an analysis of the physical risks of climate change to banks. Both of these reports highlight the imperative to have a longer time frame in the analysis. 2See European Central Bank, Climate-related risk and financial stability, Project team on Risk Monitoring, July 2021 available at https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.climateriskfinancialstability202107~87822fae81.en.pdf. Page 7 of 14
Climate-related risks should be incorporated over a period of 30 or more years to sufficiently take into account the real risks facing the economy. 7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks have used, or have considered using, both insurance and carbon offsets to mitigate climate-related financial risks. Regarding the use of insurance contracts, we believe that the residential and commercial mortgage divisions of large banks are directly exposed to the risk of insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal. Specifically, with the recent increase in acute climate-related physical risk comes the specter of home insurance price increases or possible denial of coverage in certain areas. For example, AIG recently announced plans to leave the California market due to climate risks. The most recent NOAA data shows that the U.S. has experienced 20 separate billion dollar weather and climate disasters in 2021. We believe that the bank market’s reliance on the availability of home insurance for its residential mortgage portfolio in particular could lead to a climate-related gap in risk monitoring. As such, we recommend that banks study the potential impact of residential property insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal on the value, default rate, loss given default, and financing cost of residential mortgage portfolio holdings. We ask the OCC to consider including this risk in “Management of Risk Areas, Legal/Compliance Risk”. There is also risk for other portions of the banks’ portfolios. With regards to the use of carbon offset credits (or other similar carbon trading schemes) as a risk mitigation strategy, Atmos recommends that the primary focus of banks should be on “absolute GHG reductions” through client engagement and portfolio allocation as opposed to “net GHG reductions” via financial engineering. Any such GHG offset strategies should be used sparingly and only as a last resort. Outside of insurance and offsets, banks’ relationships with their clients must be at the heart of any strategy for climate risk mitigation. Arguments that large banks “bank the entire economy” and as a result have no pathway to reduce their climate risk miss the critical role of client engagement and transition, and seek to ignore the banking industry’s willing participation in carbon-intensive practices to date. Business within a sector can be shifted towards companies with a higher share of sustainable assets and/or robust transition plans. The recently released Page 8 of 14
2030 plans from a few of the largest banks take initial steps with some of their client sectors. While further actions are needed, these are good initial steps. The availability of “investable opportunities” is an important factor in how easy it is to mitigate risk through sustainable finance. The current structure of the economy will mean that most banks, particularly the largest ones, will have a “long” exposure to the business-as-usual case and a “short” exposure to the transition scenario. However, proactive banks may be able to capture enough sustainable opportunities to adjust this balance in a way that manages their overall transition risk. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks currently offer their borrowers a variety of “green” products, such as sustainability-linked loans, derivatives with embedded sustainability KPIs, etc. While we encourage banks to support their client’s climate risk management and sustainability efforts, banks should pay attention to the potential unique reputational risks these products entail, such as the risk of “greenwashing” by the bank and/or the borrower. Greenwashing is the process of knowingly or unknowingly conveying a false impression as to how sustainable or environmentally sound a product or service actually is. It can occur when the benefits conferred by the product or service are not material to the bank or borrower, or relevant to the borrower’s primary business activity. It is our opinion that the vast majority of existing products are “green” in name only. Similar to the SEC’s current initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related misconduct (SEC Division of Enforcement Climate and ESG Task Force), we encourage the OCC to include a requirement that bank compliance frameworks are updated to include greenwashing surveillance. As such, we ask the OCC to consider including this risk in “Management of Risk Areas, Other Nonfinancial Risk”. New companies and products, including Atmos Financial, are beginning to emerge to help banks with the transition. This emerging sector represents a significant economic opportunity for US-based solutions with global implications. Page 9 of 14
9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? The communities most affected by climate change will likely be those that historically represent LMI and other disadvantaged communities. Therefore it is imperative that banks incorporate this risk element when considering climate-related financial risk strategies. It would not, however, be an acceptable outcome for banks to retract accessibility to banking services and products from groups of disadvantaged communities based on risks from their geographic footprint. The OCC can and undoubtedly should play a pivotal role in assessing the legal and compliance impacts of a banks' strategic climate-related exit from certain geographies or community engagement against the legal and compliance requirements of the Fair Lending Act, National Flood Insurance Act and the Flood Disaster Protection Act. There are various strategies that could be incorporated by the OCC and/or legislative bodies to ensure the continued accessibility of financial products supporting disadvantageous communities. For banks to credibly assess the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities, Atmos sides with other industry thought leaders and recommends that banks commit to principles of diversity, equity and inclusion and that bank board members and senior management are selected from a diverse and inclusive pool of candidates drawn from the communities that the financial institutions serve. Incorporating the principles of a just and inclusive economy is foundational to any effective climate risk management regime. We appreciate the OCC’s decision to withdraw the CRA requirements established by the prior administration. We encourage banks to build on their current efforts to include diverse voices into various levels of decision-making. It is important to have individuals representing different life experiences to advise on key financial decisions. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? Page 10 of 14
What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? We recommend that banks obtain the following data in support of effective climate risk management: ● Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions data from borrowers, ● Information on planned capital expenditures and their likely impact on company emissions, as well as transition plans (if available), ● Geolocational information of all critical borrower infrastructure, ● Borrower climate disclosures prepared using the TCFD framework (banks should encourage borrowers to disclose this information using the TCFD framework to ensure that climate-relevant data is comparable across industries and geographies), ● Likely exposure to financial risks generated from necessary changes to end consumers in highly impacted areas. ● Detailed climate related assessments of collateral including but not limited to projections of the useful life of the asset. To minimize compliance costs, banks should also be encouraged and incentivized by the OCC to actively contribute to the development and sharing of climate-relevant borrower data, as appropriate. Banks should also be encouraged to use a common set of standards, such as the PCAF framework, for measuring their Scope 3 emissions associated with client activities. Without a standardized framework, and conforming that framework to international standards whenever possible, it may be difficult to accurately assess banks’ risk and the effectiveness of their mitigation strategies. However, under no circumstances should banks be allowed to let any perceived difficulty in standardizing assessment protocols preclude inclusion of Scope 3 emissions in their assessments. As banks compute the inventory of GHG emissions associated with their loan portfolio under a PCAF or other framework, banks may indicate the lack of investable opportunities puts undue burden on their shareholders. We do not think this is a valid argument. There is no shortage of opportunities, and scientific evidence has suggested as much as $100T needs to be invested in the clean economy over the next 20-30 years. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? Page 11 of 14
Atmos sides with other industry thought leaders and recommends that existing regulatory reporting requirements for banks be expanded to require the use of the TCFD framework to ensure that public disclosure of climate relevant information is comparable across banks of varying asset size, location, and business model. Additionally, as part of identifying and quantifying climate-related financial risks, Atmos believes that large banks in particular should establish and disclose net zero plans which describe in detail how they plan to decarbonize their business activities and achieve net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Furthermore, large banks should set interim decarbonization goals (for example, 2030 goals) and provide regular updates towards achieving them, to ensure a financially-stable glidepath that ensures we meet the UN’s 1.5 degree target. Finally, all interim goals and 2050 net zero commitments should incorporate the latest science, use credible climate scenarios and disclose decarbonization progress on a sector by sector basis. Detailed disclosure of net zero and interim goals will ensure that large banks sufficiently participate in the decarbonization of the economy just as they disproportionately benefited from the industrial activities leading to the climate crisis. We encourage the OCC to consider augmenting existing regulatory reporting requirements to include this additional risk-mitigating disclosure. Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? Broadly, real estate lending decisions have taken into account likelihood of natural disasters based on historical probability analyses. This form of historical analysis is no longer able to project the future potential for risk. Therefore, science-based scenario analysis is a critical component of measuring climate-related financial risks inherent to a bank’s lending portfolio. The primary challenge confronting most banks will be a lack of prescriptive guidance on which modeling to use, and the incorporation of such modeling. It is unlikely that most banks will be able to make an appropriate science-based determination of that risk. Specialty companies Page 12 of 14
have started to emerge to aid banks in making these determinations. It is our opinion that such practices and assessment specialties will be adopted by audit and assurance firms, speciality companies and insurance companies. This is an appropriate division of power to maintain objectivity, though it requires significant regulation and guidance of such firms providing those services as well as prescriptive guidance on how such information is used to prevent further abuse of disadvantaged communities. The use of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing for regional and community banks can be characterized as being in its infancy. The main challenges they face in advancing their climate scenario analysis and stress testing programs are both technical and operational in nature: ● Some regional and community banks do not yet consider climate to be a material risk factor, and so are not engaging their borrowers in obtaining climate-relevant data, ● When client engagement does occur, borrowers are unable or unwilling to provide climate data (for example, GHG emissions), ● In all cases, regional and community banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, ● Furthermore, they are often waiting for regulatory guidance before investing resources in the design of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress capabilities. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? When designing and executing scenario analysis, at a micro-level, we believe that the scientific rigor and transparency of the scenarios are paramount. As such, banks should ensure that their scenarios: ● Are science-based and aligned with the most current climate change science, ● For transition risk, the scenarios should consider both an “orderly” and “disorderly” transition, ● For physical risk, the scenarios should contain at least one ""worst case"" scenario, ● Assumptions regarding both demand and prices for commodities (such as oil) should be transparent and clearly stated, and ● Scenarios should be aligned with current best practices (i.e., IEA and NGFS scenarios). From a macro-standpoint, the U.S. regulatory regime has proven itself to be robust and flexible enough to meet the challenge of many recent perils. For example, due to the effectiveness of Page 13 of 14
periodic scenario analysis testing and monitoring of capital requirements, regulators have been able to successfully navigate new threats to bank safety and soundness such as cybersecurity and the coronavirus pandemic. We believe that thorough and well executed risk management procedures that include climate-related financial risks can offer similar safeguards for financial stability. Thus when considering which macro factors are most salient to designing and executing climate scenario analysis exercises we recommend that first and foremost the OCC continue to act with a sense of urgency around this existential and systemic threat. Second, as climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets and poses grave threats to banks of all sizes and business models, we recommend that these scenario analysis exercises should be adopted by all U.S. banks irrespective of asset size, location, or business model. Third, the OCC will need to ensure that banks have access to educational resources in support of bank innovation regarding climate scenarios, models and data. Finally, we believe that climate scenario analysis exercises should eventually evolve into a formalized climate stress testing regime which informs regulatory capital adequacy metrics. Without climate stress testing, we believe that banks are at risk of running a higher quantum of enterprise risk than they are aware of, posing a danger to the safety and soundness of our financial system. Once again, we congratulate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for its fine work in developing these Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. Your leadership on this critical issue is deeply valued. We would be pleased to discuss any questions you may have on our feedback. Sincerely, Peter Hellwig, Co-Founder Atmos Financial, PBC Page 14 of 14","Atmos Financial, a financial technology banking services provider, submitted comments on the OCC's Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. Atmos supports extending these principles to all U.S. banks, regardless of size, due to the pervasive threat of climate change. They highlight the increasing frequency and severity of climate-related disasters and their financial impacts, urging the OCC to enforce mandatory climate risk management practices. Atmos suggests a staggered implementation timeline for smaller banks and emphasizes the need for detailed guidance on self-assessment of climate risks. They advocate for aligning U.S. regulations with international standards and stress the importance of incorporating long-term climate risks into financial assessments. Atmos also calls for transparency in climate-related financial products to avoid greenwashing and recommends that banks consider the impacts of climate risk strategies on disadvantaged communities. They propose using the TCFD framework for regulatory reporting and emphasize the need for science-based scenario analysis.

We believe that Final Guidance closely based on the Draft Principles would effectively support and provide the needed flexibility to advance the efforts of financial institutions with respect to their climate-related financial risk management. We appreciate this opportunity to provide additional thoughts and look forward to engaging in further conversations on this topic with you. A. IIB’s Distinctive Perspective The IIB represents internationally headquartered financial institutions from over 35 countries around the world doing business in the United States. The IIB’s members consist principally of international banks that operate branches and agencies, bank subsidiaries, and broker-dealer subsidiaries in the United States. Our members believe that financial institutions have an important role to play in facilitating the climate-related transition objectives of their clients and approach the topic of climate change and financial risk from an international perspective. Many of our members are headquartered in jurisdictions where financial regulators are in the process of implementing, or have implemented, regulations and supervisory expectations pertaining to climate-related financial risk. For instance, regulators in some of the jurisdictions of our members have formally assessed how financial institutions are managing climate- 1 OCC, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021). ___________________________________________________________________ The Institute’s mission is to help resolve the many special legislative, regulatory and tax issues confronting internationally headquartered financial institutions that engage in banking, securities and/or insurance activities in the United States. ___________________________________________________________________
related financial risk as compared to supervisory expectations or are asking financial institutions to conduct scenario analyses. In addition, many of our members already have deployed considerable resources toward the management of climate-related financial risk, including by developing greater internal climate risk management expertise (such as hiring dedicated personnel and teams), modeling and undertaking scenario analyses, and engaging with regulators on these issues. We come to this Request for Feedback with enthusiasm about what principles-based, internationally consistent climate risk management guidance stands to achieve. We believe that a principles-based Final Guidance provides the best avenue for allowing financial institutions to make tailored risk management decisions and operate under multiple international regulatory regimes. As organizations in the business of managing risk, financial institutions are uniquely well-suited to help their clients meet their climate objectives and manage the challenges that a transition to a lower carbon economy could entail, while remaining focused on the financial institution’s own management of physical and transition risks. Financial institutions have a role to play in the efforts of their clients to further climate-related transition objectives, including those clients operating in traditionally carbon-intensive industries. Participation in these efforts likely will take different forms and differ among financial institutions across timelines and geographies. Consequently, flexible, principles-based guidance – in contrast to prescriptive requirements2 – maximizes the chances that financial institutions can bring innovation and resources to better support the climate-related transitions of their clients. We would be pleased to meet with you to discuss the Request for Feedback and provide you with information about practices in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as our experiences with clients and other regulators. Further, under the understanding that the federal banking regulators are in dialog on this issue, we have copied the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) on this letter. We also have copied the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”), which has also been focusing on climate-related risk management. Below, we offer some additional considerations and request some key clarifications in relation to the issuance of any Final Guidance. B. The Final Guidance Should Continue to Recognize that Methodologies, Models, and Data for Analyzing Climate-Related Financial Risk Remain a Work in Progress We appreciate the OCC’s acknowledgement in the Draft Principles that “incorporation of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time.” As the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s (“FSOC”) recent report similarly notes, “Defining, identifying, measuring, and monitoring exposures to climate-related financial risks will necessitate investment in data and analytic capacity by FSOC members, other government agencies, and the private sector.”3 2 As Governor Brainard has stated in the context of climate risk, “We would not tell banks which sectors to lend to or which sector to not lend.” See also Board Chair Jerome Powell, as quoted in Law360 (Jan. 11, 2022) (“Climate is appropriate for us as an issue to the extent it fits within our existing mandates. I think it does, in the sense of it’s another risk over time that banks are going to run. But the broader answer to climate change has to come from legislators and the private sector”). 3 FSOC, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021). 2
Methodologies, models, and data for analyzing climate-related financial risk remain a work in progress. To take the example of data gaps, financial institutions are both producers and consumers of data. A financial institution can only fully evaluate its own financial risks by drawing upon relevant and appropriate data situated outside the financial institution’s own operations. Such data must be collected from its clients, counterparties, and transactions, and there is no question that consistent and comparable data is not always easily available and does not always exist.4 For example, broad corporate public disclosure lacks standardization, rigor, and granularity, and forward-looking data from clients on their transition plans is weak at best. While these sources mature, banks must continue to rely upon approximations and extrapolations derived from less direct data sources. We believe that financial institutions should continue working to identify and understand gaps in methodologies, models, and data. As Acting Comptroller Hsu suggested in a recent speech, the risk management processes of banks and the questions that their boards should start posing to management can have an important role in illuminating gaps in information and tools.5 These endeavors will be non- trivial given the multitude of overlapping, often inconsistent, and rapidly evolving private and public sector definitions and measurement approaches to climate risk, reporting regimes, and the vetting of numerous regionally limited third-party data offerings. Even as data becomes more available, the proliferation of definitions and measurement approaches could complicate the efforts of financial institutions to incorporate this information into their risk management frameworks. Thus, such efforts will take time and likely will necessitate cooperation between regulators and the financial services industry. Scenario analysis as a risk management tool also remains in development, and the accuracy and effectiveness of scenario analysis depends on the availability of high-quality data, as well as advancements in modeling over medium and long time horizons. The Draft Principles make clear that scenario analysis is just one tool alongside others in enhancing climate-related financial risk management. Any Final Guidance should continue this position, and additionally make clear that scenario analysis is a separate exercise, distinct from traditional stress testing, and is not intended to affect capital requirements or supervisory actions regarding U.S. operations. We believe that attempts by other jurisdictions to incorporate scenario analysis into stress tests or capital requirements are premature6 and have created confusion based on how nascent measurement methodologies and data would influence current capital requirements. To maximize the potential effectiveness of any guidance related to scenario analysis, we would urge further dialog between regulators and industry. We would be pleased to discuss our experiences with scenario analysis in other jurisdictions with the OCC. 4 Like the OCC, domestic and international regulators and standard-setting bodies have acknowledged the data gaps that affect the measurement of climate-related financial risk. Reports by a number of authorities have emphasized this important issue. See, e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), Climate-related financial risks – measurement methodologies (Apr. 14, 2021); Networking for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), Progress report on bridging data gaps (June 3, 2021); Financial Stability Board, The Availability of Data with Which to Monitor and Assess Climate-Related Risks to Financial Stability (July 7, 2021); FSOC, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021); European Systemic Risk Board, Positively green: Measuring climate change risks to financial stability (June 8, 2020); Climate Financial Risk Forum, Climate Data and Metrics, (Oct. 21, 2021). See also Board Gov. Lael Brainard, “Building Climate Scenario Analysis on the Foundations of Economic Research” (Oct. 7, 2021). 5 Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu, “Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask” (Nov. 8, 2021). 6 See, e.g., Sec. Janet Yellen, as quoted in Bloomberg Law (Feb. 2, 2022) (“It’s just premature at this point to talk about raising capital requirements . . . it’s really important that regulators do the groundwork that’s necessary for them to evaluate risks to individual firms”) and Board Gov. Lael Brainard, “The Role of Financial Institutions in Tackling the Challenges of Climate Change” (Feb. 18, 2021) (“To be clear, scenario analysis is distinct from our traditional regulatory stress tests at banks”). 3
If finalized largely as written, the Draft Principles would allow sufficient leeway for, and encourage, the continued development of methods, models, and data to quantify and understand climate- related financial risks. C. Domestic and International Cooperation Around Consistent and Comparable Climate Change Risk Management Principles Is Critical The risks and effects of climate change are rarely confined within state or national borders, making dialog and coordination among regulators essential. Disparate initiatives on climate-related financial risks among various jurisdictions could lead to circumstances in which different sets of requirements result in inefficient and duplicative efforts (or even worse, conflict with each other). We applaud the OCC for its international work (e.g., participation in the NGFS as well as the BCBS’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks), its climate-related work under the FSOC umbrella, and other initiatives such as the creation of the Climate Change Risk Officer position, one of the aims of which was to expand the OCC’s capacity to coordinate with stakeholders, and more. We urge the OCC to continue its coordination efforts among U.S. and international regulators (as the OCC indicated it would in development of the Final Guidance), as well as its dialog with industry participants. To foster clarity and efficiency, the Final Guidance should reflect the aggregate views of the U.S. prudential regulators (the Board, the FDIC, and the OCC) and, to the extent possible, consistency with state-level regulators. Inconsistent or uncoordinated guidance is likely to come at the expense of effective risk management. Internationally headquartered financial institutions develop their risk management and strategic decisions for the consolidated organization at the level of head office, and the institution is subject to the laws and regulations of a non-U.S. jurisdiction on a consolidated, enterprise-wide basis. Consequently, a key consideration for an internationally headquartered financial institution is whether it can use the work that the financial institution does to understand, quantify, and manage climate-related financial risk in one jurisdiction across the organization to meet the expectations of other jurisdictions. Final Guidance that is flexible and principles-based, as the Draft Principles are, will allow for the development of methodologies, models, and data that are fit for multiple purposes across entities and geographies, including both host and home country supervisory expectations. Moreover, additional multinational and international frameworks for data, risk measurement, and other key financial institution tasks will undoubtedly be developed and adopted, and we urge the OCC to maintain sufficient flexibility such that a financial institution’s adoption of those international standards will exhibit compliance with U.S. regulatory expectations as well. We believe that Final Guidance that incorporates the principles-based expectations of the Draft Principles would provide internationally headquartered financial institutions with the necessary flexibility to consider the regulatory postures of their home countries and of internationally agreed upon standards. Even in the context of internationally consistent and comparable risk management guidance, issues will remain that should be addressed through cooperation among regulators. To name just a few examples, entities within an affiliated financial institution group that are subject to the rules of different jurisdictions are likely to encounter inconsistent timing requirements for implementation or for meeting regulatory expectations. Furthermore, the Draft Principles, like other climate-related financial risk management pronouncements by international regulators and standard-setters, use the term “material.” Guidance from the OCC and other U.S. regulators should clarify that each institution should be able to make decisions of materiality based on its own facts, circumstances, geographical footprint, home country regulator, and other similar factors. In addition, “materiality” also has a specific meaning in the securities law context, and regulators should acknowledge that the investor focus of the securities laws and their disclosure requirements (including conservative development of forward-looking risk factors) does not 4
necessarily equate to what may be material for safety, soundness, and risk management purposes. These competing meanings of “materiality” provide just one example of the importance of flexible, principles- based guidance. D. Any Final Guidance Should Consider the Unique Structure and Governance of Internationally Headquartered Financial Institutions An important undercurrent to our comments is the theme of adaptability and iteration. We believe that flexible, principles-based Final Guidance in the same vein as the Draft Principles would best accommodate the ever-evolving climate risk management landscape. Supervisory activity stemming from the Final Guidance also should consider the reality that best practices around climate-related financial risk management remain in development and should support rather than dictate the efforts of firms to refine, readjust, and revisit their approaches in light of evolving capabilities and circumstances. To that end, any Final Guidance should constitute “guidance” under the OCC’s framework for guidance.7 We also would expect that the OCC would provide reasonable timeframes for banks to incorporate the principles of the Final Guidance into their risk management processes. Rather than require conformance with the new guidance by a certain date, the Final Guidance should focus on ensuring that banks are working effectively, in good faith, to establish and evolve their climate-related financial risk management practices. Any timeframes for implementing the Final Guidance should reflect and accommodate the iterative nature of climate-related financial risk management, particularly given limitations with respect to models, methodology, and data, as well as potential compliance obligations in different jurisdictions. We applaud the OCC for its statement that it will tailor the Final Guidance “to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.” There are many different factors that shape a bank’s climate-related financial risk profile (for example, even institutions that are the same size could have very different climate-related risk exposures). As previously mentioned, for internationally headquartered banks operating in the United States, the unique structure of their operations reflects a further need for appropriate tailoring to take into account the fact that enterprise-wide risk management principles, analyses, and business strategies are established by a bank’s board and management at head office, and any risk management policies, procedures, and principles applied in the United States must necessarily be consistent with those enterprise-wide mandates. We also would ask that the OCC clarify that the Draft Principles (and subsequent Final Guidance) apply only to federal branches / agencies that have over $100 billion in total consolidated assets at the branch or the agency level and, separately, to internationally headquartered national bank subsidiaries of financial institutions that have over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. We believe that Final Guidance that reflects the principles-based approach of the Draft Principles would be helpful and effective. If there is any material development of the Draft Principles beyond the high-level approach already taken (as we note that the OCC indicated that it likely would present a more granular Final Guidance taking into account additional views from the Board and FDIC, as well as further research into climate-related financial risk management), we would expect that these developments would be open to additional review and comment to give industry and other stakeholders the chance to weigh in on these important issues. * * * 7 OCC, Role of Supervisory Guidance, 86 Fed.

We appreciate your consideration of our comments and would welcome the opportunity to discuss these comments and the specific concerns and perspectives of our members. Sincerely, Briget Polichene Chief Executive Officer Institute of International Bankers bpolichene@iib.org cc: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation New York State Department of Financial Services 6","The Institute of International Bankers (IIB) submitted feedback on the ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks"" proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The IIB supports the principles-based approach, emphasizing flexibility and international consistency to accommodate the evolving nature of climate risk management. They highlight the importance of allowing financial institutions to tailor risk management practices to their unique circumstances and international regulatory environments. The IIB stresses the need for cooperation among regulators to avoid conflicting requirements and supports the development of methodologies, models, and data for climate risk analysis. They also emphasize the importance of scenario analysis as a tool distinct from stress testing. The IIB calls for guidance that considers the unique structures of internationally headquartered banks and requests clarity on the applicability of the guidance to certain institutions. They advocate for ongoing dialogue and flexibility in implementing the final guidance, reflecting the iterative nature of climate risk management."
kzn-b7ow-ugrn,"In the past decade, even as we have begun to understand how truly catastrophic climate change will be and  how little time we have left to act, too many banks have given lip service to reducing carbon emissions while continuing to invest millions in loans to fossil fuel companies in support of the activities that are driving this crisis.  Regulators must stop financial institutions from gambling with our future through shortsighted business decisions that will destroy both our economy and the environment. 
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: 1)	Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2)	Plan for climate change over a long-time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available- 3)	Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits;  4)	Make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must ensure that the actions of big banks’ match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.
Thank you for taking on the vital matter of climate change. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to begin acing now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk.","The comment criticizes banks for their continued investment in fossil fuels despite acknowledging the catastrophic impact of climate change.

We agree with and strongly support the OCC’s acknowledgement of the threats posed by the climate crisis for the safety and stability of individual banks, the banking sector, and the US financial system overall. ICCR is a coalition of over 300 institutional investors, which includes faith-based institutions, socially responsible asset management companies, unions, pension funds, endowments, and other investors that collectively represent over $4 trillion in invested capital. Our members are deeply concerned about the disruption posed by climate change to the health of the global economy and the well-being of our societies, and have been engaging companies on the importance of assessing and mitigating climate risk for over three decades. In particular, ICCR members have been engaging closely with major banks and insurance companies on the need to assess and manage the climate risk embedded in their lending, investment and underwriting portfolios. Resolutions filed with the major banks in recent years have made clear investor concern about the importance of setting net zero targets, as well as meaningful interim decarbonization targets. We understand climate risk for the finance sector to include not only risk to the institution but, using the language of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, banks’ salient risks: the risks to society and ecosystems from continued financing of fossil fuel infrastructure, deforestation and other activities fueling the climate crisis.1 As such, we welcome regulatory guidance to help ensure adequate risk management by major banks. We welcome the net zero commitments set by major banks and note that many have set interim commitments and are working to measure and disclose their financed emissions. Yet these same banks continue to finance new fossil fuel activity even as the International Energy Agency (IEA) points out the need to stop new oil & gas development if we are to have a hope of staying under a 1.5oC rise in global temperature. This continued investment in fossil fuels drives climate change, spurring a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. A focus of engagements in the 2022 shareholder season has been on the adoption of policies in line with the IEA 1.5oC scenario. 1 https://www.ungpreporting.org/resources/salient-human-rights-issues/ 1
Investors, and society at large, need regulators to set strong guardrails for banks on climate risk to protect the economy and promote planetary stability. We urge you to press banks to take the urgent steps necessary to protect both their business and our economy and communities from the climate risk their short-term financing is building into the system. We support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: I. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business. The net zero commitments made by banks are an important first step, but to reach these goals in a way that protects the real economy in the limited time we have for corrective action, banks will need to make sweeping changes to their governance, risk assessment and lending decisions. Regulatory guidance is recognized as being necessary to help effect the deep change needed. II. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available. Climate risk is substantially different from traditional financial risk, both because the risk is fundamentally systemic in nature, and because it operates on a different time horizon. The financial risks associated with climate change include physical and transition risks, which pose the threat of systemic risk. Decisions made now to finance fossil fuel-related development, particularly new development, will have a long-lasting effect on the economy and climactic systems. Banks’ traditional strategic planning horizons must be extended to take this into account. Investors recognize the problem of inadequate emissions data but support the OCC’s guidance that banks should act now with the best available resources and seek to integrate improved and updated data over time. Asset managers also need to measure and report their financed emissions and will benefit, along with banks and insurance companies, from improvement of the availability and quality of climate-related models and data. III. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits to those exposures. Recognizing the limitations of data and climate disclosures, investors note both that these are constantly improving, and that further improvement will be spurred by increased demand. Most importantly, transition planning needs to be pursued now. Clear and consistent metrics can help banks identify and work to reduce their climate-related exposures, and working with their high-emitting clients to develop and implement effective transition plans is an important means of achieving this. IV. Ensure that banks’ internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments. As universal owners, the asset owners and asset managers that make up ICCR’s membership are relying on banks to develop effective plans to meet their net zero commitments to mitigate climate risk in the real economy, the strength of which is vital to ensuring economic stability and continuing profits over the long- term. It is critical that the OCC ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, as well. Finally, we agree that “The board and management should also consider climate- related financial risk impacts on stakeholders’ expectations, the bank’s reputation, and LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products and services.” As banks incorporate climate risk mitigation measures, they should work to ensure that they are not disproportionately affecting “communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity.” Improving the availability and accessibility of financial products and 2
services to these communities is essential for enabling a transition that will be truly just, inclusive, and broad-based, which is critical for social stability and true economic prosperity. Regional and community banks, which play an outsized role in LMI and rural communities, are under-resourced to address climate risks. We understand the OCC’s focus on principles for large banks. Nevertheless, tailored guidance and support to regional and local banks, including ensuring their access to quality data, tools, and services, will be especially important, again, to ensure broad-based economic well-being. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate. Guidance should include regional banks that are also exposed to climate risk, yet which lack adequate resources to assess and manage the threat. Thank you for your consideration of our comments. We look forward to enhanced climate risk guidance for banks as a vital step in ensuring the stability of the U.S. financial system.

kzn-bpls-5iee,"February 14, 2022 VIA ELECTRONIC FILING Chief Counsel’s Office, Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 RE: OCC Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Attention: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023-0001 To whom it may concern, The 21 undersigned organizations welcome the opportunity to comment on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC’s) Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We support this important step toward addressing climate risk in the banking system, and many of our organizations have also written in other comments to support strengthening the draft principles with respect to tailoring for banks of all sizes, ensuring robust climate scenario analysis, and aligning banks’ climate commitments with their internal strategies and governance. We write specifically here to urge the OCC to carefully consider the potential impacts of climate supervisory guidance on racial, economic, environmental, and climate justice, and how these expectations will interact with fair lending principles and regulation and consumer financial protections. Prudential climate financial regulation is vital, and it must not result in additional burdens on vulnerable communities and households, the very consumers who are most at risk from climate impacts. To this end, it is critical that the OCC expand its climate risk guidance to all banks in a way that recognizes the important role credit and banking services should play in helping vulnerable communities in building resilience to climate disasters. Such guidance should include how banks can and should maintain the operational resilience of the critical services they provide. It should also encourage both large and small banks to support community investment in adaptation instead of withdrawing credit, to finance green investment, and to protect consumers from unsafe “green” financial products that lack adequate consumer protections and/or do not deliver purported climate benefits. LMI communities, communities of color, and the banks that serve them are more vulnerable to physical risks from climate impacts. Decades of racist housing, lending, and siting policies–many created and perpetuated by the federal government itself–that denied households and communities of color equitable access to financial services have resulted in massive racial and economic disparities in wealth, climate
vulnerability, environmental justice, and public health. These policies have segregated people of color and lower income households into neighborhoods that face not only higher levels of toxic pollution (e.g., from fossil fuel infrastructure) but also far greater physical vulnerability to climate impacts like flooding1 and extreme heat2 that harm infrastructure, public health, and local economies. In particular, EPA finds in an analysis of “socially vulnerable groups” that people of color are most likely to live in areas that will face the worst climate impacts. Black individuals are 40 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in mortality rates due to climate-driven changes in extreme temperatures. Hispanic and Latino individuals are 43 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected labor hour losses in weather-exposed industries. American Indian and Alaska Native individuals are 48 percent more likely to live in areas where the highest percentage of land is projected to be inundated due to sea level rise.3 The connection between redlining and climate vulnerability is clear; they co-exist in a feedback loop that further entrenches racial and economic inequality. In recent years, climate impacts–especially in underserved communities–are leading to ever-increasing annual direct damages,4 disruption to local economies based on agriculture, tourism, and energy,5 and sometimes ultimately emigration6 and loss of tax base,7 effectively bankrupting small towns across the country8 and destabilizing local financial institutions.9 Underserved communities tend to be both the most exposed to these damages and least able to access the federal aid resources to recover financially.10 In 2020, the National Advisory Council to FEMA troublingly found that “Many FEMA programs do not consider the principle of equity in financial assistance relief…Through the entire disaster cycle, communities that have been underserved stay underserved, and thereby suffer needlessly and unjustly.” In fact, research has shown that “holding disaster costs constant, the more [FEMA] money a county receives, the more whites’ wealth tends to grow, and the more 1See E.g., Redfin News, “A Racist Past, a Flooded Future: Formerly Redlined Areas Have $107 Billion Worth of Homes Facing High Flood Risk–25% More Than Non-Redlined Areas,” 2021. https://www.redfin.com/news/redlining-flood-risk/ 2Hoffmanet al., “The Effects of Historical HousingPolicies on Resident Exposure to Intra-Urban Heat: A Study of 108 US Urban Areas,” 2020. https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm 3EPA, “Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States,” September 2021. https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/climate-vulnerability_september-2021_508.pdf 4NOAA, “Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters,” 2022.https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/ 5U.S. Global Change Research Program, “Fourth National Climate Assessment -Volume II: Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States,” 2018. https://nca2018.globalchange.gov 6The NYTimes and ProPublica, “The Great Climate Migration,” 2020. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html 7Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), “Climate Change and Long Term Fiscal Sustainability,” 2021. https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/scoping-paper-on-fiscal-sustainability-and-climate-change.pdf 8The NYTimes, “Climate Change is Bankrupting America’s Small Towns,” September 2021. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/climate/climate-towns-bankruptcy.html 9The Wall Street Journal, “Banks Take a Hit from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita,” 2005. https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112993899645076384 10Urban Institute, “Improving Disaster Recovery of Low-Income Families.” https://www.urban.org/debates/improving-disaster-recovery-low-income-families
blacks’ wealth tends to decline, all else equal. In other words, how federal assistance is currently administered seems to be exacerbating rather than ameliorating wealth inequalities that unfold after costly natural hazards.”11 As the stability of local banks is deeply linked to the economic fortunes of the communities and households that they serve, institutions that provide vital access to financial services for underserved communities face particular challenges due to climate change. Bank supervisors must be on the lookout not only for systemic risks that affect the largest banks, but subsystemic safety and soundness issues that will affect certain geographies, sectors, and bank business models with elevated climate risk, as well as the risk that bank failures may pose to consumers through banking consolidation. Further, banks are chartered to serve the convenience and needs of their communities, so not only is their financial stability dependent on the economic stability of those communities, banks should be a driving force in ensuring that stability for all members of those communities. Supervision must encourage banks to enhance operational resilience and expand physical access to banking in LMI communities and communities of color. The OCC should use supervision to ensure that banks remain operationally resilient in the face of climate-related disasters and that they offer financial services to underserved communities on an equitable basis. OCC should extend and tailor their supervisory guidance to smaller institutions. 80% of institutions supervised by the OCC are smaller banks and federal savings associations,12 many of which are regional, community, and agricultural banks. Some are more vulnerable to climate risk than larger banks due to the financial needs they meet and their more limited geographic range and product offerings, and they are also critically important for the financial health of rural and underserved communities. Banks must be prepared for increasingly common and severe disruptions due to climate-related disasters–such as wildfires or hurricanes–and chronic stressors like persistent flooding and extreme heat. Preparations should extend to electrical power, communications systems, and physical resilience of branches, servers, offices, and ATMs. Branch closings in increasingly climate vulnerable areas may be avoidable by investing in operational resilience. The OCC should work in particular with smaller banks to disseminate policies and procedures that have worked to maintain resilience during previous disasters and encourage their implementation. 11FEMA National Advisory Council, “National Advisory Council Report to the FEMA Administrator,” November 2020.https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_nac-report_11-2020.pdf; Howell and Elliott, “As Disaster Costs Rise, So Does Inequality,”Socius,4 Dec 2018. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023118816795 12 OCC, “Community Banks.” https://www.occ.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bank-management/community-banks/index-com munity-banks.html
Risk mitigation measures that rely on avoiding or raising rates in climate vulnerable areas will have disparate impacts on LMI communities and communities of color. In an effort to remain safe and sound, it is critical that larger, more diversified banks do not retreat from climate vulnerable communities, but instead find ways to promote climate resilience for their customers and communities. “Bluelining” is a developing practice where financial institutions identify areas as having higher environmental risk and avoid offering loans and banking services, or raise costs in those areas.13 Seemingly risk-based analysis will recreate the same boundaries as previous redlining decisions that create and perpetuate racial and economic inequality. Such practices are particularly harmful to underserved communities that often lack ready access to credit at fair rates to rebuild. The OCC draft principles contain only a brief mention of the potential fair lending risk that may be associated with these harmful mitigation practices under the category of legal/compliance risk. To avoid disparate impacts of the guidance, OCC must place greater emphasis on fair lending risk–it should be an essential component of all aspects of the climate risk management that banks do–especially given the troubling history of discriminatory policies and practices that have led to climate vulnerability for underserved communities. As part of the guidance, OCC should provide examples of climate risk mitigation strategies that pose potential fair lending risk exposure for banks. Further, OCC should collect data to determine how prevalent climate-induced curtailing of financial services has become for LMI communities and communities of color. As part of this guidance, it should also require that banks identify, measure, monitor, and address potential and occurring disproportionate impacts on communities of color and LMI communities. Banks should have a system for tracking their actions to avoid or address disproportionate impacts and documenting their progress on addressing those impacts. OCC should also provide clear supervisory expectations and work with banks to manage climate-related risks in ways that do not create disparate impact on underserved communities. There are methods available that serve the same purpose without discriminatory effect. For instance, the OCC could encourage banks to invest more in other resilience measures, such as divesting from assets exposed to a high degree of transition risk, or provide more low-cost funding for climate adaptation measures in vulnerable communities. The OCC should work also with other government agencies to examine banks’ needs and other federal climate and disaster resilience resources to deal with climate risk that can be deployed to lessen climate vulnerability and deter banks retreating from the communities and households that most need access to financial services to prepare for and recover from climate-related disasters. Special attention and resources should be provided to small CDFIs with strong track records of serving underserved communities, MDIs, and institutions that cannot easily diversify. 13Abraham Lustgarten, “How the Climate Crisis WillShape Migration in America,” The NYTimes, 15 Sept 2021.
The OCC should encourage safe and fair lending strategies to improve the climate resilience of communities and households they serve, and discourage predatory products marketed with a “green” label. Acceptable climate-risk mitigation can include lending strategies that promote climate resilience, including the development of climate resilient affordable housing, schools, and businesses; clean electricity projects and microgrids; nature-based protective infrastructure (“green infrastructure”); building decarbonization, which includes holistic home weatherization and health interventions; electric public transit and electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and lending to green small businesses and corporations with legitimate decarbonization transition strategies. For smaller community-based banks, investments in weatherization and climate resilience for local businesses can improve the financial health of the community and promote safety and soundness. Climate-risk mitigation measures generally should be developed in a way that ensures accessibility and affordability in LMI communities and communities of color. Unfortunately, many community banks have noted that the novelty of these climate-resilient asset classes creates regulatory uncertainty, chilling lending. The OCC should prioritize providing guidance on green lending for underserved communities, which will help small banks deploy capital in socially productive ways. To do this, the OCC can survey what has worked for smaller banks, or even green banks, who have successfully underwritten such loans, and transmit the specific policies and procedures that could be put in place to underwrite green loans in novel markets. Such guidance will provide confidence to smaller banks in moving forward on these kinds of loans. At the same time, the guidance should recognize where “green” financial products have not been good for consumers, and steer banks away from those products. For example, residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loans offer the dubious promise of electricity bill savings through energy efficiency or renewable energy upgrades, but most programs do not fully asses the borrower's ability to repay, and the borrower’s home serves as collateral for PACE financing and payments are collected through the local property tax system. Failure to pay can leave the homeowner vulnerable to tax foreclosure. And as with the subprime lending abuses that led to the recent financial crisis, residential PACE loans frequently target the most economically vulnerable borrowers–low-income families, the elderly, and borrowers of color–many of whom may be eligible for grants or low cost loans to address energy efficiency and for whom PACE loans may be an unaffordable and risky product. Residential PACE lending has become an urgent problem in low-income communities and communities of color where the product is actively sold using aggressive sales tactics and homeowners are often pressured to sign up without an actual assessment of home needs or suitability. The OCC must caution banks away from propagating this product, as well as others like it. The OCC should also ensure that any novel approaches to housing finance intended to promote energy efficiency retrofits and upgrades do not feature the unintended consequence of overpromising savings and, as a result, place consumers in loans they cannot afford or loans that are not justified by the subsequent energy savings.
We thank the OCC for moving forward with supervisory guidance to mitigate climate risk within the banking system, and we urge your consideration of fair lending implications and incorporation of appropriate equity safeguards within the supervision and examination process.

kzn-btsl-f7kq,"February 14, 2022 RE: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Attention: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 Dear Comptroller Hsu, We are pleased to submit comments in response to the request for public feedback on the Office of the Comptroller’s (OCC) recent publication of the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks on behalf of RMI’s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance. We strongly agree with and welcome the OCC’s acknowledgement of the threats that climate change poses to the safety and stability of individual banks, the banking sector, and the US financial system overall. Background on RMI and Our Expertise RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms global energy systems through market driven solutions to align with a 1.5°C future and secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. We work in the world's most critical geographies and engage businesses, policymakers, communities, and NGOs to identify and scale energy system interventions that will cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 50 percent by 2030. In July 2020, RMI launched the Center for Climate-Aligned Finance (the Center) to help the financial sector transition the global economy toward a zero-carbon, 1.5°C future. Through deep partnerships in finance, industry, government, and civil society, the Center works to develop decarbonization agreements for high-emitting sectors and supports financial institutions to decarbonize their loan books and investment portfolios. The Center also works to shape the financial sector’s operating environment by addressing barriers common to all financial institutions, including those related to financial regulation. Beyond Risk Management to Ensure Safety and Soundness As the OCC has noted,1 net zero climate commitments have become commonplace across the US financial sector, including from seven of the ten largest commercial banks. This trend arrives as the price tag for climate-related damages is already sizeable2 and growing, and there is undeniable momentum behind a global transition to net-zero. In other words, banks have publicly recognized the need for a new approach to business-as-usual to effectively address the risks presented by climate change. In 2021, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) acknowledged that climate change represents a systemic risk to financial stability and the health of the entire economy. Large banks, whose portfolios comprise a wide variety of interconnected exposures, are especially exposed to climate-related risks. Climate commitments from large banks are a welcome step, but making progress in implementing commitments will require sweeping changes to the way large banks approach their governance, risk assessments, and lending decisions. Banks can no longer mitigate climate-related risks through hedges or minor adjustments to their businesses or loan books. Ceres found that the cumulative exposure to the largest US banks’ syndicated loan portfolios alone could be larger than $500 billion from transition 1 https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2021/pub-speech-2021-116.pdf 2 https://aon.mediaroom.com/2021-01-25-Aon-finds-climate-influenced-weather-is-key-driver-of-268B-global-damage-from- 2020-natural-disasters-with-64-uninsured
risks3 and over $250 billion from physical risks,4 far exceeding currently disclosed estimates. In another study from Cambridge University, researchers found that approximately half of the expected losses that a typical equity investment would face in response to climate-induced economic shocks would be unhedgeable unless there is a system-wide response to climate change.5 Accordingly, it is imperative that regulatory guidance evolve in step, if not ahead of, necessary changes to banking practices. With that in mind, we applaud the OCC’s actions to develop the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management. In addition to our support, we urge the OCC to evaluate the need for a more systemic approach to effectively monitor individual bank operations. The OCC is entrusted with ensuring the safety and soundness of individual institutions, but, in the context of climate change, the safety and soundness of individual institutions cannot be determined from individual risk exposures in isolation of broader financial system dynamics. Given that climate-related financial risks are systemic6 and often endogenous,7 we argue that the best defense is a good offense, and that banks themselves have a proactive role to play. Reactive risk mitigation by individual banks fails to address the root of systemic risks. Further, the endogenous nature of climate-related risks means they are, at least in part, driven by financial institutions’ own actions.8 Rather than reacting to risks as they materialize, banks can take steps to proactively address drivers of future climate-related risks through their lending decisions. The OCC, alongside peer regulators, has an opportunity to pursue a more robust approach to ensuring banks’ safety and soundness by encouraging and empowering banks to play a proactive role in facilitating a timely, inclusive transition of the real economy toward net-zero, thereby mitigating a driving source of climate-related financial risks into the future. A more proactive approach can deliver the dual benefits of reducing individual risk exposures, while contributing to the long-term reduction of systemic climate- related financial risks facing the US economy. Such an approach is central to the concept of “climate alignment”9 and our work at the Center, where we support financial institutions in understanding, leveraging, and capitalizing on their role in the climate transition.10 Support for the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management While we believe a more proactive approach to regulation is the best way to meaningfully address climate-related financial risks, we firmly support the OCC’s draft principles as a complementary first step. The Center especially supports the following elements of the proposed principles: 1. Making internal strategies consistent with public-facing climate commitments. We predict that 2022 will be the year for large banks with existing public climate commitments to begin 3 https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2020-10/Ceres%20Bank%20Risk%20Report%202020%20FINAL.pdf 4 https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2021- 09/Ceres%20Financing%20a%20Net%20Zero%20Economy%20FINAL.pdf 5 https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/system/files/documents/unhedgeable-risk.pdf 6 https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf 7Chenet, Ryan-Collins, van Lerven (2019) Climate-related financial policy in a world of radical uncertainty: Towards a precautionary approach. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/iipp-wp-2019-13-climate- related-financial-policy-in-a-world-of-radical-undertainty-web.pdf 8 Danielsson, Song Shin, Zigrand (2009) Risk Appetite and Endogenous Risk. https://www.fmg.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020- 08/risk-apetite.pdf 9 https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/impact_principles_for_climate_aligned_finance_report.pdf 10 https://climatealignment.org/
substantiating those commitments, such as through interim targets11 and transition plans.12 Public climate commitments and targets can send a powerful signal of intent, including internally across banks’ business units. But commitments are only a first step, and the OCC is right to call for evidence on how banks organize their businesses to reflect their stated intent. 2. Incorporating climate-related risk management throughout business units. A pre-requisite to implementing firm-wide climate commitments is the integration of climate-aligned strategies throughout a bank’s business. Effective climate-related risk management can help banks meet climate commitments, but as described above, climate risk management and climate alignment are distinct concepts. They have distinct goals and often lead to different outcomes.13 Empowering banks to incorporate climate-related risk management at every level of their business will support banks in better understanding the myriad ways climate risks impact their firm. From here, internal strategies must go a step further to be consistent with climate alignment commitments. By proactively acting, through financial and non-financial activities, to mitigate climate risks, integrating climate alignment strategies inherently supports better integration of risk management. Our report, Zeroing In: The US Financial Sector Perspective on Net-Zero Lending and Investing,14 is based on a series of workshops the Center held in December 2020 with nine US banks and ten institutional investors to understand the challenges they face in implementing climate alignment commitments. During these workshops, participants from US banks highlighted internal challenges as a top barrier. One participant likened the transformation necessary to meet climate commitments to “changing the DNA of an organization”, requiring an evolution of all business units, functions, and operational infrastructure. To enable this holistic transformation, participants noted the need for buy-in from executive leadership and culture change throughout the institution – including by embedding climate values with portfolio managers and front-office investment teams. Regulatory clarity was cited as a key opportunity to accelerate these processes, providing the confidence necessary to reshape internal cultures. 3. Assessing climate risks differently than other financial risks. As the OCC recognizes, climate poses meaningful financial risks to US banks. However, because these risks are substantially different from traditional financial risks, a different approach is required to evaluate their true magnitude and scope. For one, both physical and transition risks will materialize over longer time periods than many banks’ strategic planning horizons and must be analyzed accordingly over longer timelines. Further, as the OCC’s guidance suggests, it is important for banks to monitor and assess physical and transition risk exposures across various segments of the economy and a bank’s portfolio, including potential correlations across those risks. We echoed these positions in a recent analysis of the FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risks: Systemic risk means that one financial actor’s vulnerability (or climate risk exposure) can jeopardize the well-being of other financial actors, corporates, and households economy-wide. Like dominoes, systemic risks can be passed through “transmission channels,” impacting seemingly disconnected parts of the economy. Acknowledging that climate risks are dynamic 11 https://rmi.org/how-the-net-zero-banking-alliance-helps-banks-set-interim-emissions-targets/ 12 https://rmi.org/five-trends-to-watch-in-climate-aligned-finance-in-2022/ 13 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20430795.2020.1848142 14 36 https://rmi.org/insight/zeroing-in/
and interconnected directly challenges traditional approaches to assessing materiality and risk on an individual asset basis. Instead, systemic risks such as these must be assessed across an entire portfolio or the financial system as a whole.15 For instance, while the physical risks facing loans to coastal properties may be predictable through first-order impacts, the complex transmission pathways for climate-related risk factors across entire economies and lending portfolios require a broader scope and further scrutiny. 4. Developing clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting limits to those exposures. Despite potential data or methodological uncertainties, starting the process of measuring banks’ exposures to climate-related financial risks can help spur the operationalization of climate strategies to reduce those exposures. This includes identifying essential data needs, engaging counterparties to develop and implement transition plans, and prioritizing actions based on where attention and resources are needed most, first. Climate risks do not necessarily require divestment to mitigate. Clear and consistent metrics can help banks identify and work to proactively reduce their climate-related exposures, such as by working with counterparties to develop and implement transition plans. Metrics can also help banks make meaningful progress on integrating organization-wide climate risk assessments and monitoring capabilities. Finally, we support the inclusion of escalation procedures to encourage attention to climate-related exposures by board and management. 5. Iteratively utilizing measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing climate-related financial risks as they evolve and mature. To steer portfolios to align with their climate goals, banks will require data and metrics that are granular (i.e., asset-specific), forward-looking, and address the most significant drivers of emissions.16 While data and disclosures are constantly improving, we support the OCC’s guidance that banks should act now with best available resources, and then seek to integrate updated resources over time. In its 2021 report, FSOC advised that not only can tools like scenario analysis be used to assess climate risks in the absence of perfect data, but their use can support data improvements over time.17 Where data gaps persist, we encourage that banks actively seek data directly with corporates and/or through collaborative partnerships with peers, data providers, and regulators to drive improved data accuracy and availability. To reinforce these efforts, we encourage the OCC, in line with FSOC's recommendations, to work with the banking sector and other financial regulators to improve the availability and quality of climate-related models and data. 6. Managing fair lending concerns for low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities. We strongly support the OCC’s disparate impact standard in examining banks’ responses to climate exposures, and we agree that banks would benefit from additional guidance on this matter. A focus on LMI communities aligns with FSOC’s acknowledgement that low-income and historically disadvantaged communities are not only disproportionately impacted by climate change but also the least equipped to cope with climate shocks. This dynamic exacerbates existing inequalities and amplifies risks to the financial sector overall when shocks occur. Improving the availability and accessibility of financial products and services is essential for enabling an inclusive, economy-wide transition, 15 https://rmi.org/we-read-a-130-page-report-on-climate-regulation-so-you-dont-have-to/ 16 https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/impact_principles_for_climate_aligned_finance_report.pdf 17 https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf
thereby reducing one driver of systemic risks. This will require a dedicated, tailored approach by financial institutions to meet the unique needs of these communities. Further, regional and community banks, which play an outsized role in LMI and rural communities, are under-resourced to address climate risks. We understand OCC’s initial focus on developing principles for large banks. However, moving forward, providing tailored guidance and support to regional and community banks, including ensuring their access to quality data, tools, and services, will be especially important. In conclusion, climate-related physical and transition risks are widely accepted to be prevalent and material to large US banks, with stark implications for the US economy, including financial markets, communities, and households nationwide. We support the OCC‘s efforts to revisit and update guidance for the safe and sound management of climate-related financial risks in this unprecedented and evolving operating environment to proactively mitigate their most severe impacts.

kzn-crue-y39j,"Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously, they are providing hundreds of billions of dollars in financing annually into fossil fuel companies. Banks' continued financing for fossil fuels is driving climate change – a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. Regulators must finally put an end to financial institutions gambling with our future. While it is notable that the OCC is beginning to assess the risks that climate change is posing for our economy, it is of paramount importance that you also compel banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address and mitigate the harms their funding decisions are causing to our environment and communities. While I support a number of issues that were proposed in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) guidance’s recommendations to banks, I believe that the OCC should instead conduct a rulemaking that compels these actions: • incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; • plan for climate change over a long-time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; • develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; and • make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments. However, it is my opinion that rather than put forward mere guidance, the OCC should instead issue mandatory obligations on regulated banking institutions so that they must assess, disclose, and mitigate the potential risks that their funding decisions could pose for climate change. Indeed, these obligations are in conjunction with federal environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as the OCC’s duty to supervise financial institutions so that they operate in a safe and sound manner. The OCC must also ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to align with the international community’s commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 ºC. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. The OCC should also acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions, including through an immediate end of financing for the fossil fuel industry’s expansion, as well as a phase-out of remaining fossil fuel financing in line with a 1.5 ºC global warming limit. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong, mandatory obligations – rather than guidance – for banks to assess, disclose, and mitigate climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment addresses Comptroller Hsu and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regarding banks' role in climate change. It criticizes banks for financing fossil fuel companies, contributing to climate change, which disproportionately affects marginalized communities.

Key recommendations include incorporating climate risk at all business levels, planning for long-term climate impacts, defining climate risk exposures, and ensuring internal strategies align with public climate commitments.

kzn-d5xe-vtpm,"February 14, 2022 Michael Hsu, Acting Comptroller Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 Via Email: Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu, The California Reinvestment Coalition writes to thank you for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. This is a critically important area that has large implications not only for the safety and soundness of our financial institutions, but also for the health of our communities, especially low-income communities and communities of color. The California Reinvestment Coalition builds an inclusive and fair economy that meets the needs of communities of color and low-income communities by ensuring that banks and other corporations invest and conduct business in our communities in a just and equitable manner. We envision a future in which people of color and low-income people live and participate fully and equally in financially healthy and stable communities without fear of displacement and have the tools necessary to build household and community wealth. Our strategic plan challenges us to ensure that Black Indigenous People of Color communities will be the primary beneficiaries of a green economy and to work to reduce the impacts of climate change on hardest-hit communities. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels.1 Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change–a crisis that puts people of color and low-income communities, our financial system, and our planet at risk. Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities. We support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:  incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;  plan for climate change over a long-time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;  develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; and  make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments. 1 See, https://www.ran.org/wp‐content/uploads/2021/03/Banking‐on‐Climate‐Chaos‐2021.pdf 1
We further urge the OCC to:  Apply any guidance, rules or other supervisory measures to all institutions regulated by the OCC, and work with the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC to address this issue on an interagency basis. The climate is degraded no less by harm financed by a smaller institution, or an FDIC or Fed regulated bank, than a large national bank. The impact on communities is the same regardless of the source of the financing. The OCC should acknowledge that community banks are particularly vulnerable to climate risk, and that the best way to reduce this risk is through reduced emissions.  Incorporate climate considerations into CRA implementation currently, and into any new CRA rules that the regulators may propose. Financial institutions cannot be said to be serving the credit needs of communities if they are financing climate change and greenhouse gases, or false “green” initiatives like the PACE program, which lead to displacement and housing and economic instability for low- and moderate-income families and communities. This is certainly true if financial institutions will restrict branch or credit access in communities based on climate related risk assessments that result from conditions exacerbated by bank financing. In this context, banks should receive positive CRA credit for engaging in green initiatives and climate change mitigation measures, but they should see CRA ratings downgrades for financing of fossil fuels and other activities that contribute to climate change.  Consider these issues when conducting fair housing and fair lending examinations and analysis of covered financial institutions. It is clear that communities of color and other protected groups are disproportionately impacted by climate change. Bank financing of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas that contributes to disparate harm on communities, and any disparate restriction of branch or credit access on communities due to climate risk, raise fair lending concerns that should be addressed today. We thank the OCC for acknowledging the fair lending concern and risk here.  Encourage or require financial institutions to report on the impacts on climate of their policies, products, and practices publicly, transparently, and uniformly. Consumers are interested in this information, and many want to do business with a financial institution that shares their values. We agree that the OCC should ensure that bank proclamations relating to climate are followed, and we urge the OCC to prevent banks from providing false or misleading information about their records. Transparency and uniform data reporting will allow consumers and investors to understand if and when banks are supporting certain positive efforts or offsets on the one hand but undermining climate resilience on the other through destructive finance. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.

kzn-d7t3-gxgd,"FEB 14 2022 Grovetta N. Gardineer Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy Office of the Comptroller of the Currency RE: Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 (Questions 1, 3, 9, and 10) Dear Ms. Gardineer, Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.1 For context, CarbonPlan is a research non-profit focused on the transparency and scientific integrity of climate solutions. Our team has expertise in climate science, climate change policy, and financial regulation. Large banks must comprehensively and proactively take steps to manage climate-related financial risk because climate change is already impacting the financial system. These impacts will only increase in the years ahead. We commend the OCC draft principles for integrating climate-risk considerations across bank strategy, governance, and risk management activities. The proposed approach appropriately reflects the organizational effort required to assess and address climate-related risks, which are emergent, complex, and likely to amplify other systemic risks. We believe the draft principles take important steps toward building a safer and more resilient financial system. As described below, however, it will also be necessary to anticipate and resolve additional challenges during implementation. One particular concern that requires ongoing attention is how integrating climate-risk in lending and access to credit might affect social and economic equity. Physical climate risks are likely to be correlated with specific geographies and communities, which raises the potential for objective risk management activities to result in potentially disparate social impacts. 1 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,RiskManagement: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback(Dec. 16,2021).
FEB 14 2021 COMMENT LETTER The correlation between climate risks and geographic location surfaces a core tension in climate-related financial risk regulation. As risk is priced — whether spurred by market forces or regulation — it may become more expensive for firms to do business in certain places. These costs will ultimately be borne by consumers and communities through reduced financial services, higher prices for loans, or eventual cycles of disinvestment. Achieving socially equitable outcomes may therefore demand policy strategies designed to facilitate more comprehensive adaptation. We do not attempt to resolve this tension in our letter, but instead identify how this concern may emerge throughout the draft principles. To further ground these points in the questions the OCC is considering, below we respond to questions 1, 3, 9, and 10. Question 1: Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? The initial focus on banks with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets avoids placing an undue burden on smaller firms that might have less capacity to manage climate-related financial risks, at least for now. Big banks are also already regulated based on the threat that their size may pose to financial stability, so it is appropriate to develop a process that furthers firms’ and regulators’ understanding of how risk could build up in larger banks that includes, but is not limited to, systemically important financial institutions. Although a focus on very large banks makes sense as a starting point, any regulatory effort that focuses exclusively on the biggest institutions could unintentionally push excess risk onto smaller, more regional entities. This is concerning because climate-related financial risks — particularly physical risks from floods, wildfires, and hurricanes — are highly dependent on the geographic location of assets and firms.2 NGO research on climate risk in the banking sector has also identified that, due to their tendency towards geographic concentration, community banks are potentially more exposed to physical risk.3 After the large banks subject to the OCC’s initial efforts begin to implement climate-related risk management practices, they could begin to shift capital away from or otherwise raise prices within regions they deem to be at relatively high risk of physical climate impacts. Any resulting capital flight or reduction in financial services by large banks included in the OCC’s efforts could further increase risks among community lenders. Academic research indicates that 2 Parker Bolstad et al.,Flying blind: What do investorsreally know about climate change risks in the U.S. equity and municipal debt markets?, HutchinsCenter on Fiscal and Monetary Policy Working Paper #67, Brookings Institution (Sept. 2020). 3 Ceres,Financing a Net Zero Economy: The Consequencesof Physical Climate Risk for Banks (Sept. 2021). (2/6)
FEB 14 2021 COMMENT LETTER banks with local knowledge may already be offloading climate-risk onto public entities — pointing to risk transfers that are already taking place.4 Given the possibility that OCC guidance could have the unintentional effect of increasing climate risks among banks that fall below the $100 billion asset threshold, we suggest that the guidance developed in this initial exploration facilitate a broader engagement with additional actors. This should include community and regional banks, who would not automatically be included in the OCC’s proposed framework. Early engagement of community and regional banks can also help identify patterns in geographic climate impacts and potential financial divestment. In certain cases, the magnitude of physical risks expected by highly geographically exposed banks may be large enough to require more direct policy interventions than the OCC can provide, but early engagement can, at minimum, help anticipate these challenges. Question 3: What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? The OCC’s focus on comprehensive integration of climate risk across bank activities is necessary and welcome. However, incorporating these principles into existing risk management systems — particularly governance and strategy — will need to be responsive to today’s bank leadership context. Today’s bank boards and management teams tend to not reflect the climate expertise required to develop robust, science-based climate-risk management processes. We appreciate that climate-related financial risk is a novel area that does not enjoy decades of traditional management research and practice. Nevertheless, given the dearth of management expertise, any forthcoming guidance that identifies specific roles and responsibilities across bank leadership will need to enable strategic decision-making using climate science and climate data. To facilitate better outcomes, we suggest the OCC partner with climate science experts to develop frameworks for using climate risk information in corporate governance. Question 9: How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? 4 Amine Ouazad and Matthew E Kahn,Mortgage Finance and Climate Change: Securitization Dynamics in the Aftermath of Natural Disasters,TheReview of Financial Studies(2021). (3/6)
FEB 14 2021 COMMENT LETTER Many banks are currently using climate modeling analysis to assess their physical risks. This requires identifying what assets are exposed to hazards like wildfires and floods, analyzing projected impacts under various scenarios, and translating projected impacts into expected loss or financial damages.5 As discussed in our answer to Question 1, banks might determine that risk mitigation requires raising prices on exposed assets — for example, making certain home mortgages or commercial loans more expensive. They might also decide to write off some regions of the country altogether. We are concerned that climate risk pricing or other loss-protecting mitigation strategies could unintentionally result in adverse social and economic outcomes for consumers and communities. For instance, communities in wildfire-exposed areas of California are already experiencing dropped policies, high premiums, and an increased reliance on less robust state programs as non-bank financial service providers (e.g. insurance companies) currently try to mitigate climate risk.6 There is no reason to believe such crises will remain contained to the insurance sector. Indeed, economic research and business reporting is already warning of “blue-lining” — a process where climate-risk assessments lead to reduced credit access in exposed communities.7 Often this prospect threatens communities that already experience a legacy of lending discrimination that has contributed to existing social inequities. Further climate-related risk designations could have the knock-on effect of limiting financing for investments that reduce residential climate risks, such as improving resilience through building upgrades — and could therefore contribute, ironically, to increasing climate risks in already-exposed geographies. Analogous cycles of disinvestment have also been described by analysts in the municipal bond market, a key source of community infrastructure financing.8 Addressing the fact that financial risk mitigation strategies could adversely impact LMI households and communities will be challenging, and might counsel policy frameworks that shift or impose new costs to better address both climate-related financial risk mitigation and social equity goals. It is also important to note, however, that proactive guidance from the OCC 5 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,Climate-related financial risks - measurement methodologies, Bank for International Settlements(Apr. 2021). 6 Dan Walters,California wildfires ignite an insurancecrisis, CalMatters(Sept. 12, 2021). 7 Lindsey Jacobson,Banks consider climate riskfor home loans, a process called ‘underwaterwriting’ or ‘blue-lining’,CNBC(Sept. 20, 2021); Michael D.

(4/6)
FEB 14 2021 COMMENT LETTER could help reduce litigation over fair lending rules — a concern noted in the draft principles’ discussion of legal risks. Question 10: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? As mentioned in our response to Question 3, bank boards and management teams often lack practical expertise in climate science or climate-related financial risk. As banks seek to quickly build capacity in this area they must rely on outside experts, including consultants and proprietary data providers for climate services.9 Banks urgently need to make decisions using climate data, but as of today, there are no transparent standards for climate data and model use, and no way to be sure that the guidance being received by banks is robust, accurate, or impartial. We appreciate that some critical information, like asset-level exposure data, likely represents sensitive business intelligence that banks and counterparties do not want to make public. On the other hand, there is no reason why the climate science scenarios and impact data or models that service providers use should remain private. The status quo leads to two related problems that the OCC should consider as it develops further guidance. First, one potential consequence of a purely private climate-services market is that it might lead to less rigorous or biased analysis. Because private firms providing climate-service consulting use methods that are generally proprietary, it is not possible to understand whether they accurately describe physical and social scientific uncertainty, or whether their services might lead to unintentional false precision or bias in clients’ resulting risk-management practices. Fundamentally, a lack of transparency about what is happening “under the hood” makes it very difficult to verify the information being received by banks as they make business-altering strategic decisions. Second, because there are no standards for the use of climate models in economic or financial risk assessment, there is no mechanism by which to incorporate new inputs from the scientific community. Various existing review processes — including those run by official government agencies — make available new data and modeling approaches that are drawn from the broader scientific literature. Because private firms' analysis operates outside of these 9 Tanya Fiedler et al.,Business risk and the emergenceof climateanalytics,Nature Climate Change11: 87-94(2021). (5/6)
FEB 14 2021 COMMENT LETTER processes, it is often unclear to the public which versions of models and datasets are being used. Furthermore, building private models on top of this public research — which is rapidly iterating — does not allow for the validation of climate-specific inputs. Without a formal oversight process, it is left up to the discretion of private firms to incorporate mechanisms for scientific feedback and reproducibility. In the absence of standards or oversight procedures, there is also no way for banks today to quickly confirm whether a provider is following industry best practices. To address these issues, the OCC could partner with climate scientists to provide public resources — for instance, non-proprietary infrastructure and supply chain data, or frameworks and heuristics for decision-making under climate-induced uncertainty. Luckily, there are already public datasets available, such as from the Network for Greening the Financial System.10 More work should be done to identify how to improve public tools so that they are transparent, relevant, and accessible to banks and regulators. The OCC should also consider partnerships with climate experts in other environmental and financial regulatory agencies in order to coordinate and standardize forthcoming guidance. Finally, because regulators across the federal government are focused on climate-related financial risk, broader cross-agency processes may be the most efficient way to share knowledge and identify best practices. Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the draft principals. We commend the OCC for its work on climate-related financial risk and look forward to continued engagement on this topic.

CFA advocates for legislative and administrative action to address the severe threats of climate change and the resulting serious economic, environmental, and public health consequences. Climate change presents substantial risks to banks, our financial system, and our economy, and many banks will benefit from clear, holistic guidance on assessing those risks. We support this important step toward addressing climate-related financial risks in the banking system and urge the OCC to meaningfully address all stakeholder concerns and questions, strengthen this draft, and develop principles that adequately address the existential and severe threat that climate change poses to our financial system. CFA is an association of non-profit consumer organizations that was established in 1968 to advance the consumer interest through research, advocacy, and education. Over 250 of these groups participate in the federation and govern it through their representatives on the organization’s Board of Directors. Our comments are based on CFA’s many years of experience advocating for consumer protections in the financial marketplace, protective financial and bank regulation, and affordable and fair access to financial services. 1. Climate Change is an Existential Threat to Our Financial System That the OCC and Other Federal Regulators Must Address The OCC is an independent bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks and thrift institutions, as well as federally licensed branches and agencies in the United States. The bureau’s work is extremely vital to the United 1
States and the banking sector, and it works closely with a variety of regulatory agencies. The OCC plays an important role in identifying and reducing financial risks. As the Federal Reserve,1 the Financial Stability Oversight Council,2 and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have written,3 climate change poses significant risks and challenges to our economy, financial system, and financial stability. It is critically important for the bureau, and other federal financial regulators, to assume a leading role. Climate change is already affecting the United States with more extreme weather and natural disasters,4 increasing surface temperature,5 and rising sea level,6 and these sweeping changes show no sign of easing.7 For example, analysis of satellite images dating back to 1979 shows that climate change is making hurricanes more intense and destructive. Now they are more likely to develop into a Category 3 storm or higher, with winds of at least 110 miles per hour.8 Additionally the U.S. Forest Service estimates that the fire season is two and a half months longer than in the 1970s, and wildfires are burning more acres than ever before.9 In 2021, over 40% of Americans lived in counties affected by climate disasters, which included flooding, mudslides, power outages, wildfires, drought, and heat waves.10 These natural disasters cause not only loss of life and property, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association reports the 1 “Climate Change Is a Source of Financial Risk.” By Glenn D.

U.S. has witnessed 310 weather and climate disasters since 1980 with damage or costs of $1 billion or more.11 Further, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) recently identified climate change as an emerging and increasing threat to financial stability. The Council stated that by collecting and publicly disclosing data, incorporating analysis of climate-related risks into supervisory and regulatory functions, and promoting disclosures of climate related risk, “financial regulators can both promote the resilience of the financial system and help it support an orderly, economy-wide transition toward the goal of net-zero emissions.”12 The risks to our financial system require further action beyond market forces and competition. Strong regulations are needed to ensure that banks adequately assess climate-related financial risks and are properly prepared for climate-related impacts, and that consumers are sufficiently informed of how climate change will affect their financial well-being. Although these principles are an important first step, the OCC also must encourage smaller banks to consider these risks and prepare for them, since smaller banks are more likely to feel the brunt of climate change’s effects. The OCC must also encourage the other financial regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), National Credit Union Association (NCUA), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), to address climate related financial risks through their regulatory and supervisory actions as well. 2. Climate Change Will Disproportionately Hurt Low- and Moderate-Income Consumers and Communities of Color Low- and moderate- income (LMI) consumers, communities of color, and other financially vulnerable Americans are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change and climate- related financial risks. These consumers already feel the brunt of predatory financial practices, discriminatory policies, and systems that perpetuate existing disparities. In addition, these consumers have less access to safe and affordable credit or traditional financial services and therefore, are more likely to be unbanked and make use of nonbank financial services such as money orders, check-cashing services, and payday loans.13 11 “U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters.” NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. 2022.

Among banked consumers, Black and Latino consumers are more likely than white consumers to have incurred overdraft fees14 and are already harmed by lack of oversight and predatory practices. Although 18% of consumers reported overdrafting an account in December 2021, these rates are higher for underbanked consumers and those experiencing income volatility.15 High interest, short-term lenders specifically target and exploit Black communities– Black adults are more likely than white adults to live near payday lenders and pawn shops.16 Although credit cards can be a more affordable form of credit, Black consumers find it more difficult to obtain them.17 Additionally, Black and Hispanic households find it more difficult to gain approval for conventional mortgages, and when they are approved they tend to pay higher interest rates.18 This is partly due to the use of credit reports and scores, which both reflect and perpetuate large racial disparities and have a very real impact on consumers’ abilities to pay their bills.19 Finally, these systems and practices exacerbate the racial wealth gap– in 2019, the typical white family has five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family and eight times the wealth of a typical Black family. These consumers are also particularly vulnerable to the greatest impacts of climate change and will be the least able to prepare for and recover from the effects of climate change, including health, labor, and financial costs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently reported consumers of color and low-income consumers face disproportionate and unequal risks of the impacts of climate change, including the impacts that air quality and extreme temperature will have on health and labor hours; property damage and loss, and traffic delays due to island and coastal flooding.20 Consumers of color are most likely to live in areas with the highest projected impacts of climate changes.21 In addition, those consumers with low-income or no high school 14 “Amid Resurgence of Interest in Overdraft, New Data Reveal How Inequitable It Can Be.” Financial Health Network.

degree are more likely to currently live in areas with the highest projected losses of labor hours.22 Consumers of color and low-income consumers are disproportionately at risk to the highest health, labor, and property impacts of climate change. Further, these consumers also bear the brunt of financial instability and crises. As we learned from the 2008 financial crisis, the effects of financial crises are disproportionately felt by low23 and moderate-income consumers24 and communities of color.25 The result is a K-shaped recovery– following a recession, different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes– resulting in exacerbation of the existing wealth, homeownership, wage, and employment gaps. Climate change and the associated financial risks will disproportionately harm consumers of color and low-income consumers. Banks are not idle spectators to the anticipated effects climate change will have on our financial system and the consumers they serve. The OCC must be aggressive and proactive to address the ways in which bank activity might be fueling climate change and ensure that banks are adequately prepared for and addressing climate- related financial risks. Further, the OCC should pay particular attention to the ways in which vulnerable consumers will be disproportionately affected by climate-related risks; and through supervision of regulated entities, monitor how safety and soundness issues affect consumers of color low-income consumers, and other financially vulnerable consumers; ensure that physical banking access is expanded and not consolidated; and make certain that their activities are driving the financial stability of all consumers they serve. In addition, CFA shares the concerns raised by other consumer advocacy groups about the need for the OCC to consider the interaction between its climate supervision policies and fair lending. 3. CFA Recommends the Following: In order for banks to prepare for climate change and the associated risks, they must adopt good governance strategies, apply transparency, accountability, responsibility, and fairness in their business activities, and the OCC must facilitate these changes through mandatory requirements. 22 Id. 23 “Weathering the Recession: The Financial Crisis and Family Wealth Changes in Low-Income Neighborhoods.” By Leah Hendey, Signe-Mary McKernan, and Beadsie Woo.

Below are several recommendations that the OCC and banks should take regarding climate- related financial risks. The OCC Should Enact Mandatory Requirements for Considering Climate-Related Financial Risk and Cooperate with Other Agencies The OCC’s principles for climate-related risk financial managements provide an excellent framework for reducing risks and preparing for worst-case scenarios. But the principles are dependent upon the banks recognizing their significance and fully embracing them; if financial institutions are reluctant to implement the principles, they are of limited use. The OCC should therefore institute mandatory requirements to ensure large banks are adequately addressing climate related financial risk and incorporating the costs of carbon emissions into their financial strategies. For example, the OCC should require greater capital requirements to counter climate- related financial risk26 and in order to do that, climate change needs to be included in economic and financial forecasts and assessments of systemic risk.27 The OCC Should Work with Other Federal Agencies to Comprehensively Address Climate Related Financial Risk Interagency cooperation is essential to reducing climate-related financial risk and ensuring that banks are prepared for its adverse, multifaceted impacts. The OCC should work with the following organizations on various projects: ● The OCC should cooperate with the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to create a national effort to develop and implement mitigation and resilience standards and strategies to reduce exposure to climate change-driven risk.28 The effort should include how banks and insurance companies will contribute to such mitigation as part of their overall work. FIO and the OCC should also develop workstreams on insurance industry underwriting practices with climate impacts, how available and affordable insurance is and the likely impacts of climate change on that affordability, and develop federal and regional strategies to meet expanding capital needs for reinsuring major catastrophes and natural disasters. 26 “Addressing Climate-Related Financial Risk Through Bank Capital Requirements.” Center for American Progress.

● The OCC should coordinate with the deposit institution regulators, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), and state banking regulators, as well as the market regulators, Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), Office of Financial Research, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has established a climate working group.29 Together with these other regulators, the OCC can require that all financial institutions publicly disclose any assets that contribute to climate change, mitigate climate risks to their portfolios, and provide credit, physical banking access, and necessary financial services to communities facing the worst impacts of climate change. ● The OCC should further cooperate with other agencies, including but not limited to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to holistically address the impact of climate change on consumer financial well-being and security. In 2021, the CFPB established a climate working group to better assess the impact of climate change on consumer financial well-being and on the markets for consumer financial products and services. The working group will also examine the adverse impacts of climate change of historically underserved and disadvantaged communities and households–an obvious area of possible cooperation with the OCC.30 Banks Should Take a Holistic View of Climate Risk and Stakeholder Exposure The principles proposed by the OCC advance critical considerations for regulated banks. As such, they should be adopted and built upon with a broader view of climate-related financial risk management. Due to the size, organizational complexity, and economic footprint of large national banks, many of which are also public companies, these banks are unique among industry sectors in the context of climate change. Large banks are exposed to the climate-related risks of their own financial entanglements, and by extension their own stakeholders are exposed to the same. Because the physical and socioeconomic footprint of large national banks is so expansive,31 regulation of them should be tailored to capture the unique risks that they present, and this reality should be reflected in the OCC’s principles for climate-related risk management and subsequent regulations. On an institutional level, the complexities of large banks’ climate exposure risk should also be reflected in risk management governance, policies and procedures, and public disclosures. 29 “Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” FSOC, 2021, at 38. 30 Id. 31 “Are Banks Prepared for Climate Change?” Boston Common Asset Management., (2015). Available at https://bostoncommonasset.com/Membership/Apps/ICCMSViewReport_Input_App.ashx?IX_OB=None&IX_mId= 18&IX_RD=Y&ObjectId=731308, (“Banks are tied to every market sector through their lending practices, making them uniquely vulnerable to climate-related risk.”). 7
As the OCC develops principles and subsequent regulations for large banks, the view must be that a bank’s stakeholders include more than just physical assets, balance sheets, and shareholders. For these banks, and as discussed throughout this comment letter, the impacts of both good climate risk management and less-than-good climate risk management will have significant downstream impacts, and this will be especially true for those communities that are already the most vulnerable, both to the physical impacts of climate change and the financial impacts of instability in the financial system. As the OCC’s proposed principles state, “The board and management should also consider climate-related financial risk impacts on stakeholders’ expectations, the bank’s reputation, and LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products and services.” This statement should be a forethought for oversight, rather than an afterthought. The OCC’s RFI asks, “How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?” This question may or may not seek to impart the same meaning of the word “material” as does the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws,32 but hopefully not. To do so would unfortunately lead to a view that may dangerously narrow the climate-related considerations of banks’ risk management strategies and those which the OCC should incorporate into its oversight. Importantly, it is difficult to identify an industry sector that has more vulnerabilities or touch points to climate change as do large national banks,33 and to limit consideration and/or management of these unique vulnerabilities by way of a narrowed materiality analysis would be dangerous for banks, stakeholders, and the financial system writ large. The climate risks of one bank are likely to also spell climate risks for many others as well, and a narrowed view of material climate risks may therefore undermine the systemic view required of the OCC.34 Appropriately, the RFI asks, ""How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?” Here again, the RFI seems to appreciate the complex, multifaceted impacts that climate change poses for banks. As such, the OCC should certainly consider information that is financially material to regulated entities’ shareholders, that is “material” in the SEC/shareholder context, but only as one piece of the larger constellation of climate change risks that should be actively managed by banks, should 32 “Comment Letter Re: Public Input on Climate Change Disclosures.” Consumer Federation of America.

be incorporated both into bank’s risk governance and strategic planning, and also codified in the OCC’s safety and soundness oversight and regulation. Banks Should Gather Expertise and Authority for Climate Scientists Banking institutions should possess substantial expertise on climate change and its impacts, both physical and financial. Knowledge about climate change is essential for making informed decisions and yet, too many banks are ignorant of this subject. Banks should be required to have climate scientists as members of their corporations and for these scientists to be given resources and authority so they can evaluate the impacts of rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather disasters, and other consequences of a warming plant. These positions should be substantive and possess the power to make real reforms, as opposed to surface level “greenwashing”— conveying a false impression or providing misleading information about how a company's products are more environmentally sound. Bank boards and management must also understand climate-related financial exposures and the vulnerability of their institutions. A few banks, including the European Central Bank and Lombard Odier, are competing to hire experts in order to gain knowledge and decarbonize their portfolios and loan books.35 Mounting evidence shows that climate change poses a serious threat to price stability and financial systems, and some institutions feel they require greater expertise. Although CFA appreciates Acting Comptroller Hsu’s identification of the following questions that bank boards should be able to adequately address, banks should impart their answers and work plans to address these concerns with the OCC: ● What is our long-term exposure to climate change, and how manageable is this exposure? ● Which counterparties, sectors, or locales need our heightened attention and focus? ● How vulnerable are our data centers and other critical services to extreme weather? ● What can we do to position ourselves to seize opportunities from climate change?36 Banks Should Divest from Climate Change Exacerbating Projects The OCC must ensure that public facing promises made by banks to divest from climate change exacerbating projects are met, and that through investment, banks are not further contributing to many of the industries that worsen climate change. For example, many banks finance activities 35 “Climate Scientists Swap Fieldwork for Finance.” By Simon Jessop, Carolyn Cohn, and Iain Withers. Reuters. April 15, 2021.

that further fuel climate change and are more likely to harm vulnerable consumers such as natural gas extraction, coal mines, and coal-fired power plants, and oil extraction and pipelines. From 2016 to 2020 the world’s 60 largest commercial and investment banks invested $3.8 trillion into fossil fuels.37 Banks must stop funding fossil fuel projects such as oil pipelines, natural gas-fired power plants, and coal-fired power plants, which emit greenhouse gas emissions and increase climate change. These projects lead to stronger hurricanes and wildfires, drought and heat waves, more frequent and extensive flooding, unusually hot or cold weather patterns, and rising sea levels, which lead to massive financial and human costs, as well as destruction of both personal property and public infrastructure. Therefore, the result is a self-fulfilling cycle of banks financing climate change, which contributes to financial instability while raising costs and creating greater exposure for the most vulnerable consumers. Despite making public facing promises to invest in clean, sustainable financing, some banks have been resistant to divest from fossil fuels.38 These actions are necessary in order to reduce climate change and transition to a lower-carbon economy. Banks must stop financing new fossil fuel projects and expanding existing projects. Further, they should start phasing out existing insurance and funding for them unless there are exceptional circumstances. Banks Should Prioritize Long Term Thinking and Analysis Traditionally banks and other financial institutions have prioritized shorter time horizons, profits, and immediate risks. While they examine past records and behavior, they make decisions based on immediate and near-future consequences. But investors, market participants, banks, and regulators all must consider the effects of climate change and its impact on risks over the long term. In comparison, insurance companies aim to distribute risk so that individuals and individual companies do not have to bear the full brunt of losses, by selling a diverse set of policies across a variety of markets. However large natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires can destroy or impact large areas and overwhelm insurers, possibly creating compounding losses. Climate change is making these cases more frequent, yet many insurers are underestimating the risks involved.39 Banks and other financial institutions must prioritize long term planning and legacies 37 “60 Largest Banks in the World Have Invested $3.8 Trillion in Fossil Fuels Since the Paris Agreement.” By Catherine Clifford.

over short term profits. They should consider circumstances and climate over the next twenty, thirty, or even fifty years, and make the necessary preparations. 4. Conclusion The OCC’s draft principles are an excellent beginning to addressing climate related financial risk. CFA urges that they be strengthened and adopted as quickly as possible. The banking industry, its regulators, and all consumers have a lot at stake, yet the burden of climate change and the financial risks will be disproportionately carried by consumers of color, LMI, and other vulnerable consumers. Climate change will impact every area of the financial sector and create dramatic risks, raising costs for everyone unless sweeping measures are adopted. We look forward to participating in this conversation going forward and offering feedback on OCC’s requirements for financial institutions. Please contact Rachel Gittleman (rgittleman@consumerfed.org) with any questions. 11","The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) submitted comments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) regarding climate-related financial risk management for large banks.

kzn-di9e-ah1o,"February 14, 2022 Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, DC 20219 Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023, OCC Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu, On behalf of the78undersigned organizations andour millions of members and supporters, we welcome the opportunity to comment on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC’s) Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We support this important step toward advancing banks’ efforts to assess and address climate-related risk, and we urge the OCC to strengthen and finalize the draft as soon as possible. Climate change poses significant risks to the safety and soundness of banks, the financial system, and communities. We support the OCC’s recommendations for big banks to take a whole-of-business approach to mitigating climate risk, to consider longer time horizons for assessing and addressing climate risk, and to develop climate-related data and scenario analysis modeling. Two elements of particular importance include directing banks to align their internal strategies with their public climate commitments, and recognizing fair lending implications and the adverse effect that risk-management measures could have on low-income and other disadvantaged households and communities. Ensuring transparency and alignment of climate commitments and strategies We welcome the provision directing banks to ensure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public climate commitments. Public statements, like recent commitments made by banks to create and execute “net-zero” transition plans, are a reflection of management’s strategic vision for the company and an important part of climate risk management. To be consistent with its public commitments, a bank’s corresponding actions and internal strategies must be grounded in climate science and technological realities. Recently, nine US banks have made commitments to “net-zero” emissions by 2050, consistent with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5°C, as members of the bank-led Net-Zero
Banking Alliance (NZBA) initiative under the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). However, these banks are falling short of establishing strategies to meet these commitments and are still engaging in actions inconsistent with them. Many continue to finance new fossil fuel and other high-emitting projects or companies expanding their high-emitting activities. These activities are not compatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 or limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. This conduct raises questions about whether bank managers desire to follow through on these commitments–and are failing to do so–or are merely seeking public relations wins. The OCC should clarify banks’ understanding of how the agency will consider the relationship between transition plans and internal strategies. Among the most significant parameters to expand on are (1) aligning financing for activities, projects, and companies that drive greenhouse gas pollution with the bank’s own commitments; (2) providing measurable near term targets based firmly in climate science and technological realities; (3) and accurately accounting for the challenges posed by offsets. Robust transition plans are important not only to ensure that banks’ internal strategies are consistent with public statements, but also because planning for a transition away from greenhouse gas emissions is important for the safety and soundness of all banks, large and small, and for fair access of marginalized communities to financial services. While some banks, such as Amalgamated Bank, have aligned their climate commitments to science and understand the need to reduce risks for both it and the financial system, other banks need additional guidance from the OCC. Linking Emissions Reductions Targets and Financing Activity Fossil fuel expansion is not compatible with any science-based limit on global temperature rise or with meeting public commitments for net-zero financed emissions by 2050. Key tenets of the International Energy Agency’sroadmap for achievingnet-zero emissions by 2050include “no investmentin new fossil fuel supply projects”and“no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants.”Yet U.S. banks, includingJPMorgan Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, are the most significant financiers of fossil fuels globally and have continued to increase their funding despite voicing their support for the Paris Agreement and committing to net zero by 2050.Citirecently committed to a29% reduction in absolute emissions from its energy sector financing by 2030, yet the bank failed to provide a plan to stop funding fossil fuel expansion to align with its net-zero pledge. More troublingly, major banks such asJPMorgan Chase,Morgan Stanley, andGoldman Sachshave setinterim targets based on convoluted financed emissions intensity metrics that are difficult to compare and do not conform with the
reduction in absolute emissions that is necessary to achieve net zero by 2050. These contradictions raise serious questions about the sincerity of banks’ climate commitments or, alternatively, the soundness of their management processes and controls. To meaningfully align their business with their commitments, banks need to follow a science based approach to meeting absolute emissions reduction targets. Measurable Targets The OCC should make clear that banks committing to net zero by 2050 must have in place, and must implement, credible internal strategies that meet the imperatives of climate science, technological realities, and safety and soundness. A credible plan in line with public commitments includes short- and medium-term targets and metrics. Such milestones are critical not just to meeting the commitments, but also to avoiding a fire sale from banks trying to meet their commitments at the last minute. A credible plan should include milestones such as a 50% reduction in absolute financed emissions by 2030. Offsets Some banks may seek to rely heavily on purported “offsets” of carbon emissions from forests, wetlands, and carbon removal technologies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. But offsets have deep limitations such that they cannot be relied on to play more than a trivial role in any credible net-zero plan. The limitations include difficultiesquantifyingorverifyingavoided or reduced emissions,questionsabout theeffectivenessandpermanenceofnatural sinksthat may bethreatenedby human or natural impacts, concernsabout the reliability andlegal normcomplianceof promised reductions due toviolationsofIndigenous rights and treaties, the lack of technologies that arecredibleanddependable,and thepotential for fraud. For these reasons,standard settersare increasingly treatingoffsets only as a last resort to negate residual emissions that remain after financial institutions have directly reduced financed emissions as near to zero as is possible. Ensuring fair access to financial services We welcome the OCC’s recognition of potential fair lending concerns as banks mitigate climate related risks. The OCC should address two key ways climate risk threatens fair access to financial services. The first is through impacts to the safety and soundness of local banks. Eighty percent of institutions supervised by the OCC are smaller banks, particularly regional,
community, and agricultural banks. Some are more vulnerable to climate risk than larger banks due to the financial needs they meet, and they are also critically important for rural communities and marginalized communities. One in five counties depends on community banks for access to a physical bank branch. The second threat is through measures taken by large banks to reduce their own exposures to credit and other financial risks. Such bank measures are likely to include closing branches in “hot-spot” areas impacted by climate-related extreme weather events, increasing costs related to financing in these areas, and pursuing other measures that could reduce access to services. The guidance’s attention to disproportionate impacts is welcome. Banks may find that it pushes them in multiple directions. While the guidance directs banks to reduce their exposures, it also notes that some responses may be unacceptable due to disproportionate impacts to marginalized communities. The OCC should move quickly to issue additional guidance on how banks can improve on equitably providing credit to vulnerable communities while acting in a safe and sound manner. As part of this guidance, it should require that banks identify, measure, monitor, and address potential and occurring disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities, such as communities of color and low-moderate-income communities. Banks should have a system for tracking their actions to avoid or address disproportionate impacts and documenting their progress on addressing those impacts. It should also recognize that orderly reductions in financed emissions would most meaningfully reduce safety and soundness risks for all banks, large and small, as well as the risk of impaired access to financial services for all communities. Conclusion These draft principles are a historic step in the right direction. They are also a starting point that should be followed by additional guidance. The U.S. lags behind much of the world on mitigating climate-related risk. We encourage the OCC to follow the lead of global peers atthe European Central Bank (ECB),Canada’s Office of theSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, and other regulators who are actively exploring the need for additional supervisory measures to respond to climate risk, including the need for increasedattention to capital and liquidity requirementsat the largest, most complex institutions. We look forward to continuing to engage with you on these issues. For questions, please contact Anne Perrault ataperrault@citizen.organd Yevgeny Shrago at yshrago@citizen.org.

EDF, Policy Integrity, and ICRRL support the Draft Principles as an important step in the OCC’s efforts to guide banks to update their risk management practices as needed in light of climate- related financial risks, thereby promoting safety and soundness. We recommend that the OCC continue building upon these Draft Principles with more detailed guidance, as it has indicated it plans to do, moving expeditiously and in coordination with other regulators working to address climate-related financial risk. We offer the following recommendations to help inform that process:4 I. The OCC should consider offering more detailed guidance regarding the physical and transition risks that affect the management of various risk areas. (Draft Principles, Page 4–5) II. The OCC should consider guiding banks on the use of relevant, accurate, and timely climate-related data for risk management and reporting. (Draft Principles, Page 3) III. The OCC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into regulatory reports and can leverage other entities’ work on climate-related disclosures. (Draft Principles, Question #11) IV. In designing and executing scenario analyses, OCC should consider defining orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot-house scenarios, setting at least a thirty-year analysis period, and accounting for the correlated nature of risks. (Draft Principles, Question #13) V. The OCC should consider how to mitigate potential harm to disadvantaged communities from banks’ climate risk management strategies. (Draft Principles, Page 1) I. The OCC should consider offering more detailed guidance regarding the physical and transition risks that affect the management of various risk areas. (Draft Principles, Page 4–5) Although the Draft Principles provide an outline of how banks should approach managing climate risk within their portfolios, they could be buttressed with additional insight into what types of risks may manifest themselves.5 The OCC notes that it “will elaborate on these risk assessment principles in subsequent guidance.”6 We support the OCC’s intent to issue additional guidance (including the specified elements), recommend that the OCC make this further guidance publicly available, and provide a non-exhaustive list of additional considerations it should include. In addition, we encourage the OCC to more clearly highlight climate-related market risk, discuss the interconnectedness of these risk areas, and include private governance initiatives as an area of non-financial risk. 4 In parentheses beside each heading, we note the question(s) from or pages of the Draft Principles to which the section is most relevant. 5 Draft Principles, supra note 2, at 4–5. 6 Id. at 4. Specifically, the OCC intends to put forth subsequent guidance regarding these principles that will “distinguish roles and responsibilities of boards of directors (boards) and management, incorporate the feedback received on the principles, and consider lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions.” Id. at 2. 2
Climate-related financial risk is generally divided into two broad categories: physical risks and transition risks.7 Physical risks include the damages wrought by wildfires, flooding, extreme heat, and other direct results of climate change.8 Transition risks are the costs associated with societal shifts in response to climate change, such as those from technological and policy changes, changing consumer sentiment, and liability for climate damages.9 Typical bank portfolios exhibit both physical and transition risks. The OCC identifies the following risk management areas in its Draft Principles: credit risk, liquidity risk, other financial risk (including price and interest rate risks), operational risk, legal/compliance risk, and other non-financial risk (including reputational, liability, and litigation risks).10 Additional guidance explicitly outlining the types of climate-related risks relevant to each risk management area would set clearer expectations for the scope of banks’ risk assessments and make it more likely that banks acquire the tools necessary to assess the climate risks in their portfolios.11 While climate risks are similar to other types of financial risks, it is also the case that “the nature of climate risks is less familiar to financial institutions.”12 Financial institutions are still building the expertise needed to identify potential climate risks and providing more tailored guidance will ensure that banks are on the right track. A. The OCC should consider clarifying how climate-related credit risk implicates both an obligor’s ability to pay a loan, as well as risk to the underlying collateral. The OCC should consider providing examples of the types of credit risk that banks should review in risk assessments. In particular, the OCC could demonstrate ways climate change could either reduce an obligor’s ability to pay or cause damage to the underlying collateral, increasing a bank’s losses in the case of default. Currently, the Draft Principles focus most closely on the risks associated with credit concentration within a particular market or region.13 While these risks are important and bear discussion, other portfolio risks could also be made clear. The OCC’s Large Bank Supervision Handbook defines credit risk as, “the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract with the bank or otherwise perform as agreed.”14 The magnitude of this risk is 7 See, e.g., Madison Condon et al., Mandating Disclosure of Climate-Related Financial Risk, 23 N.Y.U.

POL’Y (forthcoming 2022) (manuscript at 3), https://perma.cc/G3Z3-8GKY. 8 Id. at 3–6. 9 Id. at 6–9. 10 Draft Principles, supra note 2, at 4–5. 11 For a careful analysis of how climate-related financial risks intersect with each risk management category, please also refer to Amer.

defined both by the likelihood that the obligor will pay their debt and the value the bank can recover if the obligor fails to do so. In other words, credit risk responds both to the creditworthiness of the obligor and to changes in the value of the underlying collateral. Climate risk is present in both considerations. There are myriad reasons why climate-related risks could decrease the probability of debt repayment. For example, as the world transitions to a low- or zero-carbon economy, a fossil- fuel company may abandon certain projects—a transition risk. Similarly, new environmental regulations—such as the regulation of methane emissions—could make fossil fuels less profitable. Physical risks could mean that a company dependent on physical outdoor labor could have diminished productivity with increasing incidences of extreme heat. An agricultural company might face reduced crop yields. Banks should weigh these risks when assessing the creditworthiness of a debtor. Additionally, a failure to contemplate physical and transition risks may mean that the collateral underlying a loan is overvalued. Consider, for example, a home in California in a wildfire-prone area. If the home burns down—a physical risk—the value of the collateral is severely reduced. Even absent a fire, the looming specter of this risk could cause a home to lose value if, for example, insurers are no longer willing to cover the risk of wildfires or if consumers have concerns about living in wildfire-prone areas.15 In assessing a bank’s safety and soundness, the OCC already considers a bank’s underwriting practices with regards to the sufficiency of collateral and creditworthiness of obligors.16 The climate’s impact on credit risk is an aspect of these traditional concerns. By providing illustrative examples of credit risks, the OCC can ensure these risks receive sufficient due diligence. B. The OCC should consider providing more detail on the types of climate-related liquidity risks a bank may face. While the OCC properly includes liquidity risk as a category to be considered in risk assessments, additional detail would be useful. The OCC should consider clearly laying out examples of climate-related liquidity risks and also describe how liquidity risks may 15 See Jay Feinman, What Is a Protection Gap?

L.J. 82, 95–96 (2020) (describing how insurers are moving away from wildfire coverage, creating challenges for homeowners in wildfire-prone areas); Martha C.

exacerbate—or be exacerbated by—operational and market risk.17 Liquidity risks may materialize when there is reduced buyer interest in particular assets. For example, societal movement away from fossil fuels could result in stranded assets, posing liquidity issues for banks invested in these assets.18 C. The OCC should consider providing additional detail on market risk and suggesting acceptable measurement methods for such risk. The Draft Principles section on “Other Financial Risk” discusses interest and price risk— components of market risk.19 The OCC notes that there are challenges with existing methodologies to estimate these risks and therefore advises banks to “use the best measurement methodologies reasonably available to them.”20 The OCC should consider treating market risk more explicitly within the Draft Principles and suggesting an array of acceptable measurement methodologies. Market risk—the risk that an institution’s investments lose value—is a significant avenue for climate-related financial risk. Physical risks, for example, can threaten commodities, such as agricultural products, which could affect future values.21 Transition risks can also affect investment value. For example, policy or technology changes that align the U.S. energy system with a carbon-zero future could lead to declines in the oil market;22 given the global nature of the oil market, policy or technology changes in other parts of the world could lower demand for oil as well.23 These risks could be explicitly noted. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) anticipated regulations on climate-related disclosures should assist banks in considering climate impacts as they make certain types of investments.24 In turn, this should make it easier to conduct thorough risk assessments regarding market risk. However, many tradeable assets may not be subject to the SEC’s 17 Nahiomy Alvarez et al., A New Framework for Assessing Climate Change Risk in Financial Markets, 448 CHICAGO FED. LETTER (Nov. 2020), https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2020/448 (noting that “typically, climate change risk is unlikely to make an asset less liquid without making the asset lose value, making a borrower insolvent, or disrupting financial infrastructure”). 18 See Drew Riedl, Why Market Actors Fuel the Carbon Bubble: The Agency, Governance, and Incentive Problems that Distort Corporate Climate Risk Management, J.

regulation. Municipal bonds, for example, are not subject to SEC reporting requirements.25 The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has requested that the Municipal Securities Regulation Board (“MSRB”) examine how best to estimate climate-related risk; the OCC should remain abreast of this work.26 These market considerations are within the ambit of risks that banks should already be considering. Bank supervisors already assess a bank’s “price sensitivity to various market factors (e.g. . . . commodity prices) [and] . . . sensitivity of assets, derivatives, and mortgage servicing rights to valuation inputs (interest rates, prepayments, and volatilities).”27 The Draft Principles nevertheless serve as a critical reminder that the climate crisis will likely affect these prices in a tangible way and that these climate risks must be contemplated. Adding more detail could help ensure these risks are properly considered. D. The OCC should consider describing third-party operational risk in more detail. The Draft Principles provide some detail on how climate change could exacerbate operational risks. Additional concrete examples, demonstrating the range of risks, could be helpful, particularly regarding third-party risk. Even if a bank’s operation centers do not themselves face climate risk, if they depend on at-risk infrastructure—such as sanitation and power grids—the risk inherent in that infrastructure propagates to the business operations. While Hurricane Sandy caused evacuation orders that directly shuttered many Wall Street banks, in February 2021, it was failures in the Texas electricity grid that forced banks to close branches.28 In our interdependent world, it is not sufficient to consider only the risk associated with a particular parcel of land; banks must also consider how third-party risk enters the system. While the Draft Principles mention “third-party operations” as a source of risk,29 making these connections more explicit will encourage banks to create more robust plans. E. The OCC should consider more explicitly describing how legal and compliance risk interplay with other forms of risk. While the Draft Principles currently discuss legal and compliance risk, the OCC should consider expanding the discussion to describe the interconnectedness between legal risk and other 25 FSOC Climate Report, supra note 12, at 87; see also Parker Bolstad et al., Flying Blind: What Do Investors Really Know About Climate Change Risks in the U.S. Equity and Municipal Debt Markets? 4–5 (Hutchins Ctr.

types of risk. For example, the OCC flags “changes to legal requirements for . . . flood or disaster-related insurance” as an area of potential legal or compliance risk.30 While changes to these legal requirements would pose a compliance risk for a bank, it is also the case that changes in insurance requirements could pose a credit risk, particularly given that property and casualty insurance terms are often only a few years long—shorter than many loan terms.31 F. The OCC should consider including private governance initiatives as a sub-category when discussing other non-financial risk. The OCC notes that banks should consider other non-financial risks, such as reputational damage, liability, and litigation. In addition to these risks, OCC should also consider explicitly mentioning the potential for private governance initiatives,32 including investor pressure. Member banks of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance have committed to align their assets and liabilities with a pathway to a net-zero carbon emission earth by 2050.33 It is possible that banks that have not made such commitments will face investor pressure to do so and, on the other hand, that banks that have committed will be held to those commitments by shareholders. In either case, banks should be aware of their position within the net-zero commitment landscape. II. The OCC should consider guiding banks on the use of relevant, accurate, and timely climate-related data for risk management and reporting. (Draft Principles, Page 3) As the OCC recognizes in its Draft Principles, “[s]ound climate risk management depends on the availability of relevant, accurate, and timely data.”34 The OCC should consider guiding banks on best practices regarding sources and analytical methods for climate risk data. Banks should use data both from counterparties and from public sources to develop a comprehensive picture of their climate-related risk exposure. With transactional counterparties, banks should solicit information regarding risks to the particular assets or activities involved in the transaction, as well as risks to the counterparty’s creditworthiness generally.35 The OCC could also guide banks on reliable sources and proper uses of various 30 Id. 31 See Antonio Grimaldi et al., Climate Change and P&C Insurance: The Threat and the Opportunity, MCKINSEY & CO.

types of publicly available data, such as climate-related disclosures, climate projections, and climate-related financial risks. Data should be incorporated as relevant into identification, measurement, management, and disclosure of climate risks. To efficiently develop rigorous and consistent climate data practices, the OCC should consider ways to coordinate with other regulators working to address climate risks, as well as other experts and stakeholders. The OCC’s membership in FSOC, which has commenced work on climate risk issues including data,36 as well as in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), provide important opportunities for coordination among U.S. financial regulators generally and banking regulators specifically. Given the global nature of both the financial system and climate risks, continued participation by the OCC in the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”)37 and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”)38 will also be important. Finally, the OCC can benefit from communication with other agencies with expertise in climate-related data, like the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, including through structures like interagency working groups. III. The OCC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into regulatory reports and can leverage other entities’ work on climate-related disclosures. (Draft Principles, Question #11) The OCC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into the disclosures made in their quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (“call reports”) and any other regulatory reports where such information is relevant. Requiring public disclosures by regulated entities of climate-related financial risks can spur better risk identification and management practices by those entities, as well as provide benefits for regulators, investors, the market, and the general public. In designing these requirements, the OCC can leverage existing and forthcoming work by other regulators, entities, and experts on disclosure of climate-related financial risk. Call reports are a core source of data for safety and soundness supervision, and the OCC should consider how these reports can be updated to reflect climate-related financial risks to banks. As the OCC states in the Regulatory Reporting section of its Comptroller’s Handbook, “[t]he call report data provide detailed financial information on the bank’s assets, liabilities, capital, 36 FSOC Climate Report, supra note 12, at 47–66. 37 See NGFS Publications, NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FIN.

income, and expenses, as of the report date and for the period covered.”39 The FFIEC provides instructions on preparation of call reports.40 Updating these instructions with details on where and how to incorporate climate risk into a call report will benefit both the reporting entities and the users of reported information.41 Standardizing disclosures helps to ensure that they are comparable, specific, and decision-useful.42 Disclosing climate risk information publicly, such as through call reports,43 benefits multiple stakeholders.44 As explained by FSOC, “[r]egulatory reports assist the federal banking agencies in fulfilling their supervisory mandates, and assist the public, state banking authorities, researchers, and bank rating agencies in understanding the condition of the banking sector.”45 Mandating disclosures would benefit banks by compelling them “to engage in careful and systematic analyses of their exposures to climate risk, preventing them from ignoring worst- case scenarios or unfavorable information,” while also addressing the collective action problems and mismatched incentives that dissuade voluntary disclosures.46 Access to improved climate risk information benefits investors, who can better align their investment decisions with their objectives, which in turn helps the market avoid the destabilizing effects of a burst “climate bubble.”47 Given the role climate-related disclosures can play in preventing economic crises and internalizing externalities, the greater public also benefits.48 Many other entities, including other regulators, NGOs, and IGOs, have undertaken efforts on developing climate-related disclosures that the OCC can leverage to the extent that they are relevant in this context.

climate risk disclosure resources developed by FSOC, NGFS,49 and BCBS.50 The BCBS climate risk principles include guidelines specifically for examiners as well as for banks, an approach that OCC should consider for its subsequent guidance.51 Among U.S. federal regulators, the SEC has made the most progress to date, with a proposed rule mandating climate-related disclosures expected in early 2022. In addition to looking to the SEC’s ultimate approach, the OCC can analyze the voluminous materials on climate disclosures that various experts submitted in response to the SEC’s March 2021 request for public input.52 Many of those submissions highlighted the work of voluntary disclosure regimes like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures53 and the industry-specific Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards (including for financial institutions),54 which could likewise be a useful resource for the OCC. Banking regulators in other jurisdictions both internationally, like the European Central Bank (“ECB”),55 and sub-nationally in the United States, like the New York Department of Financial Services,56 have also taken substantial steps on disclosure of climate risk by regulated entities. The OCC may also consider consulting with other types of state regulators that administer reporting or disclosure requirements relevant to certain climate-related physical or transition risks, including greenhouse gas emissions. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, for example, could provide valuable information on methane disclosure from the oil and gas sector.

IV. In designing and executing scenario analyses, OCC should consider defining orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot-house scenarios, setting at least a thirty-year analysis period, and accounting for the correlated nature of risks. (Draft Principles, Question #13) A number of other jurisdictions have begun conducting either scenario analyses or stress tests over the past few years. These jurisdictions include the ECB,59 the Bank of England,60 the Bank of Canada, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,61 among many others.62 The OCC should take notice of the scenarios used by these jurisdictions and their comparative advantages, as well as the sample scenarios prepared by NGFS.63 Here, we flag three best practices of particular interest: in designing and executing scenario analyses, the OCC should consider defining scenarios that include an orderly and disorderly transition, as well as a hot-house scenario, setting at least a thirty-year analysis window, and accounting for the correlated nature of risks. A. The OCC should consider designing orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot- house scenarios in order to ensure that banks are exercising safe and sound practices with regards to each of these possible these outcomes. The OCC should consider designing scenarios reflecting an orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot-house world, in order to ensure that banks are meeting safety and soundness assessments under each of these possible future scenarios. Much is still uncertain about the extent to which the world will rise to the challenge of climate change. The scientific community, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “has collectively chosen four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs),” reflecting a range of possible trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting climate impacts, “to help [standardize] and improve comparability of climate change analysis.”64 Financial sector experts 59 Spyros Alogoskoufis et al., ECB Economy-Wide Climate Stress Test, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (Working Paper No. 281, Sept. 2021), https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op281~05a7735b1c.en.pdf. 60 GUIDANCE FOR PARTICIPANTS OF THE 2021 BIENNIAL EXPLORATORY SCENARIO: FINANCIAL RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE, BANK OF ENGLAND (2021), https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/stress-testing/2021/the-2021-biennial- exploratory-scenario-on-the-financial-risks-from-climate-change.pdf. 61 HONG KONG MONETARY AUTHORITY, PILOT BANKING SECTOR CLIMATE RISK STRESS TEST (2021), https://www.hkma.gov.hk /media/eng/doc/key-functions/banking-stability/Pilot_banking_sector_ climate_risk_stress_test.pdf. 62 See NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FIN.

then analyze the economic implications of these different emissions pathways, taking into account the accompanying societal action. The best-case scenario is an “orderly transition,” meaning stakeholders reduce emissions at a consistent rate, stemming warming around 1.5 to 2°C, as compared to pre-industrial levels.65 This approach would blunt the worst of physical risks, while imposing some transition costs. On the other hand, it is possible that no climate action—beyond current policies—is taken. In this case, warming peaks at a much higher level leading to a “hot-house” scenario.66 Under a hot-house scenario, early transition costs are limited because the economy does not decarbonize; however, physical risks are much more severe than under an orderly transition.67 A third possibility is between the two: a “disorderly transition.”68 In this scenario, emissions continue at the level of current policy commitments for another decade or so, at which point severe physical harms spur action to limit warming to 1.5 to 2°C, leading to increased transition costs as the world strives to reduce emissions on a shortened timeline. This third scenario, therefore, carries both high initial physical costs and high and abrupt transition costs, though ultimately lower physical risks than the hot-house scenario. Depending on which scenario occurs, the nature, timing, and scale of physical and transition costs vary. In order to understand whether banks will continue to meet safety and soundness requirements, it is necessary to understand how banks’ portfolios would be affected under these different possible pathways. Among other jurisdictions that have conducted scenario analysis, the three scenarios described above are a consistent fixture, with the primary variation being whether the orderly and disorderly transition cap warming at 1.5 or 2.0°C.69 B. The OCC should consider at least a thirty year time horizon and would likely benefit from also considering longer horizons. In determining the time horizon of the scenario analysis, the OCC should consider at least a thirty year time horizon and would likely benefit from considering longer time periods as well, capacity permitting. NGFS notes the tradeoffs in setting a time window for scenario analysis. While a shorter scenario window period reduces uncertainty in the estimate and may be more immediately actionable, a longer window gives more thorough insight into climate-related risks that are likely to affect the financial institution’s balance sheet, long-term, particularly as assets can be long-lived.70 65 Id. at 18. 66 Id.

Other jurisdictions have taking varying approaches, with some setting windows in 2050, 2080, and 2100, while others consider a timescale of five years or less.71 If possible, sampling a short, medium, and long-term window would allow the OCC to gain the most thorough understanding of a bank’s risk. It may be particularly important to include a window that is at least thirty years in length, in order to account for the traditional thirty year mortgage cycle and other long-term loans. The mortgages that banks make today, for example, could be on their balance sheets until 2052, at which point the collateral will have faced highly escalated physical risks from climate change. C. In executing scenario analyses, the OCC should be mindful of correlated risks. In executing scenario analyses, the OCC should be mindful of the interplay among correlated risks. Sudden, large shocks to a bank’s portfolio could be more damaging than risks accruing over time in a more manageable fashion. Regional banks, for example, could be at particular risk from geographically correlated risks, such as wildfires or hurricanes. Although non-regional banks benefit from geographical diversity, they are not immune to correlated risks. Climate change may cause shifting environmental conditions and extreme weather events that affect large portions of the world at the same time.72 Furthermore, transition risks are also correlated. Under a scenario that includes decarbonization due to policy or technology changes, for example, there may be mass devaluation of oil and gas assets.73 This could lead to large portions of a bank’s portfolio losing value simultaneously. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently published research investigating the risk to banks from various stranded asset scenarios that may be useful in informing the OCC’s thinking.74 V. The OCC should consider how to mitigate potential harm to disadvantaged communities from banks’ climate risk management strategies. (Draft Principles, Page 1) The OCC recognized in its Draft Principles that banks’ climate risk management strategies have the potential to harm “disadvantaged households and communities”75 that also face disproportionately high physical climate impacts. Recognizing this risk, the OCC should examine how it can take proactive steps to mitigate it, including by offering additional guidance, working with other agencies, and incorporating the input of affected communities. 71 Id. 72 See Condon, supra note 47, at 82–83 (“Recent studies, for example, have highlighted the increasing, yet still largely unanticipated, chance for simultaneous temperature- and weather-induced crop failures in key breadbaskets around the world.”); Jitendra Singh et al., Enhanced Risk of Concurrent Regional Droughts with Increased ENSO Variability and Warming, 12 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 163 (2022), https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01276-3.pdf. 73 See, e.g., Jean-Francois Mercure et al., Macroeconomic Impact of Stranded Fossil Fuel Assets, 8 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 588 (2018), https://perma.cc/7YWU-9ZG3. 74 Hyeyoon Jung et al., Climate Stress Testing, 977 FED.

Due to historical and ongoing injustices, low-income communities and communities of color face heightened climate risks such as flooding, wildfires, and heat stress.76 Some of these inequities can be traced back to redlining, a set of racist housing policies that pushed communities of color into less desirable areas, with disparities in environmental hazards that persist to this day.77 Differential spending on infrastructure, such as sewer systems, and disaster assistance has reinforced this divide in risk.78 Today, a home located in a historically redlined neighborhood is 20% more likely to suffer high flood risk than a home in a greenlined neighborhood.79 Historically redlined neighborhoods also face higher heat stress.80 As a result, if banks decided to reduce lending in areas exposed to higher physical climate risks as a risk management strategy, low-income communities and communities of color could be disproportionately affected.81 The OCC recognizes this concern in its Draft Principles, urging banks to consider “climate-related financial risk impacts on . . . [low- to moderate-income] and other disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products and services.”82 The OCC also advises banks to consider “possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity.”83 The OCC should contemplate whether and how it could revise the Draft Principles to mitigate the risk of inequitably reduced credit access and also how it might work with other agencies to address these challenges more comprehensively, informed by the input of affected communities. For example, in subsequent guidance, the OCC could consider more specifically outlining intersections between climate risk and banks’ obligations under the Fair Housing Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Community Reinvestment Act.84 This could include offering 76 See ANNA CASH ET AL., CLIMATE CHANGE DISPLACEMENT IN THE U.S. – A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE (2020), https://perma.cc/S923-2YNL; Brad Plumer & Nadja Popovich, How Decades of Racist Housing Policy Left Neighborhood Sweltering, N.Y.

recommendations for banks on strategies for reducing climate risk exposure that would preserve lending in low-income communities and communities of color, such as advising banks on how to weigh resilience measures in risk assessments. With other agencies, the OCC could consider supporting the formation of a coordinating structure, such as an interagency working group, focused on the issue of continued credit and insurance access in low-income areas at heightened risk from climate change.85 A non- exhaustive list of potential agency members could include the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates disaster relief funding and is working to update its practices to advance equity and bolster climate resilience;86 the Federal Insurance Office, which is researching climate change-driven insurance coverage gaps;87 the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is working on issues of climate risk and equity in mortgage lending;88 the Treasury Department’s Community Development Finance Institutions Fund and Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration, which facilitate access to funding for low-income communities;89 and other financial regulatory entities. Additionally, the expertise and priorities of affected communities should inform the creation and operation of any such interagency group. * * * LENDING, COMPTROLLER’S HANDBOOK (2010), https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and- resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/fair-lending/pub-ch-fair-lending.pdf. 85 The White House Climate Policy Office has formed similar interagency working groups, including one on flood resilience, in response to Executive Order 14,030 on Climate-Related Financial Risk.

kzn-fxxo-a6h3,"February 14, 2022 Chief Counsel's Office Attention: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th Street, NW Washington, DC 20219 RE: PRINCIPLES FOR CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR LARGE BANKS DOCKET ID OCC-2021-0023 Ladies and Gentlemen: The Independent Community Bankers of America (“ICBA”)1 appreciates the opportunity to provide comments in response to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (“OCC” or “the agency”) request for information regarding its Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (“the draft principles”). ICBA applauds the OCC for recognizing its draft principles should be appropriately tailored to bank size, complexity, risk profile and operations. Unlike community banks, large banks have vast resources to explore climate change methodologies that are only in the nascent phases of development. Rarely, if ever, is a “one size fits all” approach to bank regulation appropriate, and climate-related financial risk management is no exception. Nevertheless, ICBA is deeply concerned the OCC published its draft principles without first conducting any studies or gathering empirical data that shows the extent to which climate-related financial risks may, or may not, threaten bank safety and soundness or the stability of the financial system. ICBA is particularly concerned the lack of empirical data to support the publication of the draft principles coupled with the expansive scope of the proposed framework suggests the true aim of this proposal is to effectuate “Operation Chokepoint” by choking off legal but disfavored businesses and industries from the financial system. Additionally, ICBA is concerned examiners will, over time, develop a supervisory expectation that the draft principles should also apply to community banks. As is too often the case, examiners may develop supervisory expectations that large bank guidance serves as a 1 The Independent Community Bankers of America® creates and promotes an environment where community banks flourish. With nearly 50,000 locations nationwide, community banks constitute roughly 99 percent of all banks, employ nearly 700,000 Americans and are the only physical banking presence in one in three U.S. counties. Holding nearly $5.9 trillion in assets, over $4.9 trillion in deposits, and more than $3.5 trillion in loans to consumers, small businesses and the agricultural community, community banks channel local deposits into the Main Streets and neighborhoods they serve, spurring job creation, fostering innovation and fueling their customers’ dreams in communities throughout America.
model for small bank “best practices” notwithstanding the fundamental differences between large and small banks. If the OCC applied its draft principles to community banks either expressly through rules or guidance, or implicitly through “best practices,” or if the OCC implemented the misguided mission of “Operation Chokepoint,” then hundreds of community banks would suffer unnecessary and costly regulatory burden, and the consumers, farmers, and small businesses that rely on community banks could be choked off from the financial system if their local industries and economies were targeted. In light of these concerns, ICBA appreciates this opportunity to share our views on why the proposed framework should not apply to community banks and offer our recommendations for how the draft principles or future guidance can be improved. I. The OCC Has Not Published Empirical Data to Support Its Conclusion that Climate-related Financial Risk Is a Threat to Bank Safety and Soundness The OCC's statutory mission is to “assur[e] the safety and soundness of, and compliance with laws and regulations, fair access to financial services, and fair treatment of customers by, the institutions and other persons subject to its jurisdiction.”1 Critically, the National Bank Act not only authorizes the OCC to carry out its mission, but it also restricts the agency from taking actions which exceed its Congressionally authorized mission. On May 20, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Treasury, as the Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), to “engage with FSOC members” to assess climate-related financial risk.2 In response to the Executive Order, the FSOC subsequently published a report on climate related financial risks, which directed FSOC members to “address climate-related financial risks consistent with their mandates, focusing on the safety and soundness of regulated institutions.”3 Only two months later, on December 16, 2021, the OCC published its draft principles and articulated a sweeping conclusion that “weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could adversely affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system.”4 While both the President and the FSOC asked the federal financial regulators to explore climate-related financial risks consistent with their mandates, neither concluded climate-related financials risk constitutes a safety and soundness risk to individual banks. Yet, the draft principles cite only the FSOC 1 12 U.S.C. 1. 2 Exec. Order No. 14,030, 87 Fed. Reg. 27967 (May 20, 2021). 3 Financial Stability Oversight Council Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021) available at: https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf. 4 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021) available at: https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021- 138a.pdf. See also Office of the Comptroller of the Currency News Release 2021-138, OCC Seeks Feedback on Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, wherein Acting Comptroller Hsu stated, “Today’s release takes an important, concrete step towards ensuring the safety and soundness of large banks in the face of increasing risks from climate change.” 2
Report as support for the OCC’s conclusions that climate-related financial risks may threaten bank safety and soundness. ICBA is deeply troubled the OCC has not offered any additional evidentiary, statistical, meteorological, or empirical support for its position, or cited even a single instance of bank failure related to an extreme weather event or due to a bank’s failure to manage climate-related financial risk. Additionally, the agency has not acknowledged that other federal financial regulators have concluded “the average FEMA disaster is not detrimental to bank stability.”5 Without more data to support its conclusions, any final rules or guidance the OCC issues on climate- related financial risk could arbitrarily and capriciously expand its mission beyond the agency’s statutory mandate. To mitigate these concerns, we encourage the OCC to gather empirical data, conduct studies, and coordinate with the members of FSOC, as well as other government stakeholders including the SBA, FEMA, and USDA, prior to engaging in rulemaking or issuing additional guidance related to climate- related financial risk. II. The OCC Should Explain Its Approach to Climate-related Financial Risk Is Not Intended to Facilitate “Operation Chokepoint” ICBA is concerned the draft principles, however well-intentioned the framework may be, will politicize the agency, jeopardize the independence of the agency, and discourage banks from doing business with legal but climate disfavored industries such as carbon-intensive industries. Because the draft principles broadly apply to every facet of risk management, and do not provide guidance to banks or examiners to differentiate material climate-related risk exposures from all conceivable climate-related risk exposures, there is a troubling possibility the OCC could cite deficiencies in climate-related risk management at every bank in every examination. As such, ICBA is concerned the OCC could use the draft principles to implement “Operation Chokepoint” and pressure banks to terminate business relationships with clients engaged in lawful activity by “de-risking” their portfolios and declining basic banking services, such as deposit accounts and loans, to entire categories of industries the OCC believes may present climate- related financial risk. The OCC broadly defines “transition risks” as “stresses to certain banks or sectors arising from the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change.”6 Although the OCC does not further define transition risks, provide examples of transition risks, or specify which industries or occurrences might pose the most material transition risks, the draft principles require large banks to analyze transition risk considerations within every aspect of risk management, including governance, policies, procedures and limits, strategic planning, risk management, data risk measurement and reporting, and scenario analysis. The draft principles also require large banks to analyze transition risks within every facet of risk assessments including credit risk, liquidity risk, other financial risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and other nonfinancial risk. 5 Staff Reports, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, How Bad are Weather Disasters for Banks?, No. 990 (Nov. 2021) at page 9 (emphasis added) available at: https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr990. 6 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021) available at: https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021- 138a.pdf. 3
Both the breadth and lack of specificity in this proposal leave open the possibility that any number of lawful industries could be choked off from the financial system for posing climate risk, including industries that are carbon-intensive, or consume large amounts of water, energy and other natural resources, or produce, supply, or consume fertilizer and chemicals, or generate waste, and list goes on. In a recent speech, Acting Comptroller Hsu stated banks should monitor their exposure to a potential carbon tax, and prepare for resulting “transition risks” that come from a shift to a low-carbon economy.7 Yet, the Acting Comptroller did not explain how banks could measure and prepare for the impact of a hypothetical carbon tax. Given the degree of speculation involved in this analysis, and the lack of specificity from the OCC, it is plausible an examiner could interpret the draft principles such that the only way to prepare for a speculative risk would be to take the extreme measure of eliminating the risk entirely. Banks should not be forced by their regulator to de-risk entire categories of business customers based on speculation that that transition risks, no matter how remote, could arise related to the “changes necessary to limit climate change.” Further, while community banks typically are not the primary source of financing for large energy producing companies, they do provide the majority of small business credit in those communities where energy production, refinement, transportation and other ancillary businesses exist. Policies that would reduce access to credit to those businesses because they are connected to the fossil fuel industry would have devastating impacts on the local economies served by community banks. The Department of Justice has concluded that Operation Chokepoint was a “misguided initiative” and that “law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular administration might disfavor.”8 If the OCC has no intention of forcing banks to de-risk their portfolios or choke off lawful but climate disfavored industries from the financial system, the agency should make this abundantly clear in any finalized guidance and/or rules and state there will not be a supervisory expectation that banks de-risk entire geographies or industries from their lending portfolios. III. Current Risk Management Practices Adequately Protect Community Banks from Climate- related Financial Risks As stewards of their local communities, community bankers have every incentive to ensure their lending practices support the long-term prosperity of their local economies. A community bank cannot flourish without the success of the local community because its customers and loan portfolios are geographically concentrated within the local markets the community bank serves. The risks of economic shocks, customer displacement and damaged collateral (risks the OCC characterizes in the context of climate change as “transition risks” and “physical risks”) are not novel risks for community banks to manage, and each of these risks, if not properly managed, undoubtedly has the potential to impact a community bank. But history has shown that because community banks are experts in managing their risk, community banks do not fail simply because climate-related financial risks exist. This fact is evidenced by the OCC’s failure to publish any empirical data related to its draft principles to explain the agency’s conclusion that climate-related financial risks are correlated with systemic risk and bank safety and 7 Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu, Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should Ask (Nov. 8, 2021). 8 Letter from Stephen E.

soundness. While FDIC data shows 4,104 U.S. banks have failed since 1934, the draft principles do not refer to a single instance of bank failure due to a bank’s improper management of “physical risks” and “transition risks” related to climate change.9 While the OCC believes “banks are likely to be affected by both the physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change,” these “affects” are not necessarily negative, and do not ipso facto constitute threats to bank safety and soundness. In fact, in a recent New York Federal Reserve staff report titled, ”How Bad are Weather Disasters for Banks?” (“the Staff Report”), the financial regulator evaluated all FEMA disasters and found “generally insignificant or small effects on bank performance and stability. In particular, loan losses and default risk at local banks [did] not increase significantly . . . [m]oreover, not all effects are bad; income of multi-county banks increase significantly with disaster exposure.” According to the Staff Report, “local banks” (i.e. community banks) have “superior geographic knowledge” that “helps them avoid areas where disaster risks are more frequent than expected based on common knowledge.”10 Community banks have superior geographic knowledge as compared to their large-bank counterparts because “banks located closer to their borrowers have been found to harbor knowledge of both borrowers and local risk that more distant lenders may lack.”11 For example, “local banks reallocated mortgage lending from census tracts where flood risks seem understated relative to the FEMA maps (given recent flooding experience).”12 By contrast, the Staff Report’s authors did not observe similar behavior at multi-county banks.13 The detailed findings from the New York Federal Reserve are strong evidence community banks do not need additional regulation to manage climate-related financial risks. Since the late 19th century, community banks have successfully implemented risk management practices, and in so doing, have weathered and survived every type of natural disaster, including catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wind events, droughts, freezes, snowstorms, wildfires, landslides, volcanoes, and flooding. As detailed below, community banks’ current, validated, and long-standing risk management practices are not only adequate for community banks to evaluate climate-related financial risks, but they are also effective in ensuring community banks are operationally resilient and protected from failure in the aftermath of economic shocks and natural disasters. a. Disaster Preparedness and Response Community banks are well-equipped to prepare for and respond to natural disasters and property losses. Community banks maintain detailed business continuity plans which outline the processes the 9 See FDIC BankFind Suite: Bank Failures and Assistance Data available at: https://banks.data.fdic.gov/explore/ failures?aggReport=detail&displayFields=NAME%2CCERT%2CFIN%2CCITYST%2CFAILDATE%2CSAVR%2CRESTYPE%2 CCOST%2CRESTYPE1%2CCHCLASS1%2CQBFDEP%2CQBFASSET&endFailYear=2022&sortField=FAILDATE&sortOrder =desc&startFailYear=1934. 10 Staff Reports, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, How Bad are Weather Disasters for Banks?, No. 990 (Nov. 2021) at page 9 (emphasis added) available at: https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr990. 11 Id. 12 Id. 13 Id. 5
bank will follow before, during, and after a natural disaster to safeguard employees, customers, products and services, and remain operational with limited business disruption.14 These disaster plans are not obscure documents buried in dusty file drawers but are instead meticulously prepared, diligently tested, and carefully guarded reference guides that bank employees are ready to follow at any moment’s notice. Business continuity plans not only contemplate the physical destruction of bank collateral, including the bank headquarters, ATMS, and branches, but also detail how the bank will respond to the needs of its customers and the community-at-large, and, in particular cash needs, in the aftermath of a disaster’s destruction. As part of these plans, community banks proactively ensure they have enough cash on hand to meet customer needs and that redundant systems are in place so customers can continue to use debit cards and banks can readily access digitally stored bank records. Community banks also contemplate how bank employees can continue to utilize operationally critical systems and communicate with bank personnel, emergency responders, regulators, customers, and vendors in the event there is a loss of power, loss of physical bank records, inaccessible roadways, and displaced bank employees and customers. b. Concentration Risk Management Community banks are also adept in managing other types of risks, such as concentration risk, under the OCC’s existing risk management framework.15 Every community bank portfolio is concentrated geographically, thus all community banks are exposed to some degree of credit concentration risk. Yet, exposure to concentration risk, even significant concentration risk, is not indicative that a bank will fail or that the bank should be subject to heightened supervisory scrutiny. Instead, the relevant inquiry is whether the concentration risk is material and whether the bank has properly managed its risk exposures. To measure the materiality of concentration risk, community banks and their regulators evaluate the quantity of risk exposures, the quality of a bank’s risk management framework, the strength of bank governance, the adequacy of internal controls, and perform stress tests. As demonstrated during thousands of examinations, community banks are adept in mitigating risk due to seasonal weather changes and natural disasters, and credit concentration and should not be subject to additional burdensome, costly, duplicative, and unnecessary climate-related risk management practices. c. Underwriting Practices and Estimating Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (“ALLL”) Existing due diligence and underwriting practices enable community bankers to carefully assess the level of risk posed by every customer relationship and ensure effective controls are in place to monitor these relationships on an ongoing basis. If necessary, community banks will shorten the maturity of their loans to protect the bank not only from interest rate risk but also from many different types of underwriting risks including climate risks. Additionally, under the current supervisory framework for estimating credit losses, banks are expressly required to consider “qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses 14 See OCC Bulletin 2019-57 FFIEC Information Technology Examination Handbook: Revised Business Continuity Management Booklet (November 14, 2019) available at: https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/ 2019/bulletin-2019-57.html. 15 See generally Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Comptroller’s Handbook, Safety and Soundness, Concentrations of Credit, Version 2.0 (Oct. 2020) available at: https://www.occ.gov/publications-and- resources/publications/comptrollers-handbook/files/concentrations-of-credit/index-concentrations-of-credit.html. 6
associated with the institution’s existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience.”16 The OCC and other prudential regulators expect allowance estimates for ALLL to be “based on a comprehensive, well-documented, and consistently applied analysis of the loan portfolio, and should take into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as industry, geographical, economic, and political factors.”17 Plainly stated, the qualitative and environmental factors community banks currently use to analyze the adequacy of ALLL already estimate and quantify climate-related financial risk. For example, if a bank is located in a market that is in severe drought, the bank will increase qualitative and environmental factors to account for this increased risk to the loan portfolio, which in turn results in an increase in the bank’s allowance estimate. Since community banks already consider qualitative and environmental factors as part of their “comprehensive, well-documented, and consistently applied ALLL analysis,” and since most community banks will be subject to CECL by 2023 and be required to be forward looking with their estimates of loan losses, a separate risk management framework for climate risk is unnecessary. d. Securing Insurance Policies to Offset Risk With respect to their lending and investment activities, community banks are keenly aware of the importance of risk mitigation particularly during times of economic stress or extreme weather events. To mitigate climate, disaster, and concentration risks, community banks ensure their property loans have adequate flood insurance and their agricultural loans have adequate crop insurance. Crop insurance allows agricultural producers to recover from severe weather disasters and repay their farm loans. Additionally, community banks diversify their agricultural loan portfolios by utilizing the safety nets, insurance, and market protections for farmers and agricultural lenders authorized by the farm bill, including the Farm Service Agency’s Guaranteed Farm Loan Programs. The farm bill, adopted by Congress approximately every five years, provides an income safety net for commodity prices to bolster income for farmers and ranchers. The farm bill also offers farmers and ranchers several guaranteed farm loan programs. The guaranteed farm loan programs protect up to 90 – 95 percent of the loan principal, thus ensuring the repayment of most of the loan principal should farmers and ranchers become unable to repay their loans. These programs also help protect community banks against loan losses by providing tools to manage their concentration risks, which is particularly important to banks that specialize in agricultural lending. 16 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of Thrift Supervision, Interagency Policy Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, available at: https://www.occ.gov/news- issuances/bulletins/2006/bulletin-2006-47a.pdf. 17 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, OCC Bulletin 2001-37, Policy Statement on Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Methodologies and Documentation for Banks and Savings Institutions: ALLL Methodologies and Documentation (July 20, 2001) available at: https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2001/bulletin-2001- 37.html. 7
IV. Mandatory Scenario Analysis Is Not Appropriate for Community Banks Scenario analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise that should not be mandatory for community banks. To perform mandatory scenario analysis, community banks would likely need to hire specialized third-party consultants and experts to perform the work. Our members report that even conservative estimates for an independent audit can exceed $100,000. Because there are few individuals and firms qualified to perform climate change scenario analysis, the demand for this service, if mandatory for community banks, would only push the costs of these audits and exercises even higher. Community banks cannot afford to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to third parties to perform climate change scenario analyses, particularly if these analyses are evaluating immaterial or remote climate-related financial risks or are unlikely to result in any measurable changes to business operations. Since most community banks will be subject to CECL beginning in 2023, many of them will find it necessary to stress test their loan portfolios to make accurate estimates of future losses under the new accounting standard. Further, community banks can test and validate their business continuity plans by participating in FEMA’s National Exercise Program and the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program. Given that community bank portfolios are generally not as complex as large bank portfolios, and because community banks already perform numerous stress testing exercises, community banks simply do not need to perform yet another duplicative scenario analysis. ICBA is also concerned mandatory scenario analysis could force community banks to engage in an impossibly difficult exercise of forecasting for remote risks that may occur decades in the future, or which may never transpire. The longer the timeframes that are selected in scenario analysis for default and loss projections, the more speculative and expensive the analysis becomes, while the utility of the exercise, and the likelihood of any measurable changes to the business, are greatly reduced. V. Any Approach to Climate-related Financial Risk Management Must be Guided by Materiality One of the biggest challenges community banks would face in incorporating the draft principles into their risk management systems is anticipating, measuring, forecasting, and analyzing unknown and unquantifiable risks. As proposed, the draft principles are incredibly broad and lack specificity to help banks and examiners identify material climate-related financial risks that could warrant heightened scrutiny. The draft principles do not contain any guardrails to ensure examiners cannot get carried away in criticizing financially healthy banks on the basis of remote, or highly speculative, or immaterial climate-related risks. The draft principles also do not contain defining terms, detailed hypothetical or explanatory examples, time periods for forecasting, or even specify a common data set banks should use to analyze climate related financial risks. ICBA is concerned that without any of these limits, the draft principles can broadly apply to every type of physical risk or transition risk imaginable, no matter how immaterial or remote, and banks could therefore be subject to undue regulatory scrutiny for minor deficiencies in their risk management programs that are only tenuously related to climate-risk. The resources and costs that would be necessary to comply with the draft principles could quickly overwhelm a community banks’ limited staff or force a community bank to de-risk entire industries or loan portfolios even if the bank had no other safety and soundness weaknesses. 8
VI. ICBA Recommendations  To the greatest extent possible, the OCC should coordinate with other agencies and develop a harmonized approach to climate change with the members of the FSOC, as well as the SBA, FEMA, and USDA. These agencies should adopt a flexible approach that acknowledges evolving bank and supervisory practices as well as varying degrees of material climate-related financial risks.  The OCC should conduct outreach meetings with community banks to better understand why climate risk principles that may be appropriate for large institutions are not appropriate for community banks.  The OCC should not apply its draft principles or any climate-related financial risk framework to community banks with fewer than $100 billion in assets.  Before finalizing the draft principles or any additional guidance, the OCC should conduct studies jointly with the members of FSOC, as well as the SBA, FEMA, and USDA to understand whether empirical data supports the conclusion that climate risks are a significant threat to the safety and soundness of the financial system, and to determine whether a separate climate-related financial risk management framework is necessary.  The OCC should host voluntary climate risk exercises, similar to tech sprints, to facilitate an open dialogue among government stakeholders, banks, insurers, vendors, and other third parties and to identify whether a separate climate-related financial risk management framework is necessary.  If the OCC’s climate-related financial risk management framework not intended to “choke-off” specific industries from the financial system, any future guidance should expressly inform examiners there is no supervisory expectation that banks de-risk legal but climate disfavored industries.  ICBA is supportive of some incentive-based solutions to address climate change. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) recently issued an industry letter which describes the circumstances in which banking institutions subject to the New York Community Reinvestment Act (“NY CRA”) may receive credit in connection with financing projects addressing climate change, including credit for financing activities that reduce or prevent the emission of greenhouse gases that cause climate change, and adapt to life in a changing climate. The NYDFS has stated banks may qualify for credit under the NY CRA for community development lending or qualified investments that stabilize community development such as investments in renewable energy and water conservation equipment to reduce utility payments for low and moderate income (“LMI”) tenants, community solar projects, microgrid or battery storage projects in LMI areas with high flood and/or wind risk, projects addressing flooding or sewer issues or reducing storm runoffs, flood resilience activities for 9

ICBA supports tailoring these principles to bank size and complexity, noting that large banks have more resources to address climate risks. ICBA criticizes the OCC for not providing empirical data to justify the draft principles and expresses concern that the principles could lead to ""Operation Chokepoint,"" potentially excluding legal but disfavored industries from the financial system. ICBA fears that examiners might apply these principles to community banks, imposing unnecessary burdens. They argue that community banks already manage risks effectively through existing practices and that mandatory scenario analysis would be costly and unnecessary. ICBA recommends the OCC coordinate with other agencies, conduct studies, and clarify that the principles are not intended to exclude specific industries. They also suggest incentive-based solutions, like those by the NYDFS, to address climate change. ICBA urges the OCC not to apply the draft principles to community banks with assets under $100 billion and to engage with community banks to understand their unique challenges."
kzn-faiv-8qrb,"February 14, 2022 Chief Counsel’s Office Attention: Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 Submitted via https://www.regulations.gov Re: Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, Docket ID OCC-2021-0023, OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021) Dear Sir/Madam: On behalf of the undersigned, we respectfully submit the following comments in response to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”)’s request for feedback regarding Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (“Proposed Principles”).1 We request that the OCC not adopt the Proposed Principles. First, the OCC’s Proposed Principles single out climate-related risk alone for special treatment, despite more serious threats that include economic downturns, foreign wars, and public health crises. We disagree that climate-related financial risk is the single gravest threat to the U.S. banking system and that it needs special treatment. Under the OCC proposal, banks will be required to monitor and respond to climate-related risk even when immaterial, to undertake costly scenario analyses that are not required even for other material risks, and to labor under a series of requirements that have no role where other risks are concerned. This special concern for and attention to climate-related risks is irrational. There is no evidence that such risks stand above other dangers to the banking system or that banks need prompting to consider such risks. Climate risk does not need special treatment. With the Proposed Principles, the OCC ignores a more realistic and holistic approach to risk management in favor or political and social concerns. 1 OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021), Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback (Docket Number OCC-2021-0023), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html.
Second, the proposed special treatment of climate-related risk will come with great costs that the OCC cannot ignore. Under the Proposed Principles, banks will incur needless additional operating costs which they will pass on to consumers. Businesses that produce essential goods like electricity and other energy will find it more difficult to obtain credit. Americans who work for these businesses will suffer lost jobs. States that produce energy will also be adversely affected as OCC “principles” are used by lenders against energy producers. Critical consumer goods will become more expensive. Home loans in regions allegedly exposed to climate risk may become harder to obtain. Banks will be encouraged to exclude areas of the economy. The potential adverse effects of these Proposed Principles on states, businesses, and consumers cannot be overstated. The OCC does not and cannot show that the Proposed Principles justify these likely immense costs or that they benefit more than a few activists and politicians. Third, the Proposed Principles will force banks to monitor and account for speculative and immaterial risks. Banks will be required to spend more on professionals and compliance, trying to comply with these amorphous principles. Activists daily assert new, speculative harms from climate change. Under the Proposed Principles, banks may be forced to take each of these asserted harms seriously, constricting credit and other services to avoid entirely speculative risk. Fourth, the Proposed Principles are not guidance at all. These will become (and are likely intended to be) de facto legislative rules and administrative regulations. The Proposed Principles expand far beyond the scope of current law, bind the OCC staff, and given the extraordinary power the staff hold over regulated banks, it binds banks as well. The OCC should instead engage in rulemaking and provide the full set of analyses and procedures that must accompany such proceedings. Finally, the Proposed Principles also violate the OCC’s own regulations, in which the agency committed just a year ago that it would not attempt to issue binding regulations through guidance. The OCC’s casual disregard of its own regulations is one more reason the Proposed Principles, if finalized, would be arbitrary and capricious. The OCC should not adopt the Proposed Principles because they will not assist banks to assess and prepare for all material risks. Instead, the Proposed Principles will adversely affect states, businesses, and consumers and cause banks to incur more costs. The Proposed Principles may even weaken federally chartered banks and the national and state banking systems. BACKGROUND On December 16, 2021, the OCC issued OCC Bulletin 2021-62 entitled Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback.2 The bulletin regards the OCC’s “draft principles designed to support the 2 OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021), Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback (Docket Number OCC-2021-0023), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html. 2
identification and management of climate-related financial risks by banks with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets.”3 The bulletin links to a document entitled “ Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Bank (“Proposed Principles”).”4 OCC requests feedback on the Proposed Principles through February 14, 2022.5 The OCC starts the Introduction section of the Proposed Principles by stating that it “has identified the effects of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy as presenting emerging risks to banks and the financial system.”6 The OCC then differentiates between climate-related physical risks (e.g., hurricanes, floods, wildfires) and transition risks (e.g., “stresses to certain banks or sectors”), both of which are referred to in the Proposed Principles “as climate-related financial risks.”7 The Proposed Principles lists five general climate-related financial risk principles, as follows: (1) Governance; (2) Policies, Procedures, and Limits; (3) Strategic Planning; (4) Risk Management; and (5) Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting.8 The OCC states that “[m]anagement should develop and implement climate-related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile.”9 The Proposed Principles also list climate-related risk assessment principles, which are as follows: Credit Risk; Liquidity Risk; Other Financial Risk; Operational Risk; Legal/Compliance Risk; and Other Nonfinancial Risk.10 The OCC requested feedback on the Proposed Principles, including thirteen specific questions.11 DISCUSSION Proposed Principles Irrationally Single Out Climate-Related Risk for Special Treatment The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would irrationally single out climate-related risk for special treatment. Under existing law and regulations, banks are already obligated to achieve safety and soundness through monitoring and responding to risk from lending, operations, changes in law and policy, etc.12 The OCC’s staff, some of whom are on-site every day at the large banks to which the proposal applies, are obliged to ensure that banks monitor and respond to this risk appropriately.13 The OCC has previously stated that “[p]rudently managing climate 3 See id. 4 See id. 5 OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021), Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback (Docket Number OCC-2021-0023), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html. 6 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf. 7 See id. at p. 1. 8 See id. at pp. 1-3. 9 See id. at p. 4. 10 See id. at pp. 4-5. 11 See id. at pp. 5-7. 12 See, e.g., 12 C.F.R. pt. 30. 13 See 12 U.S.C. § 1 3
change risk is a safety and a soundness issue.”14 And many banks already take climate-related risk into account.15 The Proposed Principles go a big step further: they single out climate-related risk for unnecessary special treatment. Regulated banks no longer may simply treat climate-related risk as any other risk. Instead, banks must specifically focus on climate-related risk in a variety of ways. For instance: o The proposal directs that banks must communicate about climate-related risks in particular and must specially assign responsibilities for them “throughout the organization.”16 o Climate-related risk is singled out as the subject of mandatory reporting by bank management to the board.17 o Climate-related risk is singled out for assessment with regard to “stakeholders’ expectations, the bank’s reputation, and … disadvantaged households and communities.”18 o Banks must “incorporate climate-related risks into their internal control frameworks, including internal audit,”19 regardless of whether those risks would qualify for control or audit coverage under the procedures that the banks have reasonably adopted for other sorts of risk. o Bank management must “develop and implement … scenario analysis frameworks” for climate-related risks but not for other risks.20 o Banks are to “consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios.”21 Singling-out climate-related risk is unjustifiable. Climate-related eventualities do not pose greater risk than, for example, technological disruption, economic downturns, domestic 14 OCC, “OCC Announces Climate Change Risk Officer, Membership in the NGFS” (July 27, 2021), https://occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-78.html. 15 See, e.g., Bank of America, “Task force on climate-related financial disclosures report,” https://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact/task-force-on-climate-related-financial-disclosures-report (“As one of the world’s largest financial institutions, we are committed to ensuring that climate-related risks and opportunities are properly managed within our business.”). 16 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 2. 17 See id. at p. 2. 18 See id. at p. 3. 19 See id. at p. 3. 20 See id. at p. 4. 21 See id. at p. 4. 4
political changes, foreign conflicts, civic unrest, changing consumer tastes, non-climatic natural disasters, and public health crises such as the one ravaging the globe today. Even if climate- related risk were among the most important for some banks, there is no reason to believe that is true for all or most banks. Yet the proposal singles out only climate-related risk, and for all large banks. The Proposed Principles’ defenders may argue that the proposal only requires banks to monitor and respond to material climate-related risk, which they ought to do anyway under current law. This contention must be rejected for three reasons. First, the proposal does not limit its commands to material climate-related risk. For instance, management is directed to “regularly report[]” to the board on climate-related financial risks—without regard to whether such risks are regularly material.22 Similarly, banks are directed to “consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios”—without regard to whether those risks are material for particular portfolios.23 The result of the Proposed Principles would require banks to give climate-related risks a special place in their consideration without first determining that those risks are material. Second, the proposal irrationally singles out climate-related risk for special procedures that are not required even for other material risks. For instance, the proposal demands scenario analysis for climate-related risks.24 But banks are not required to conduct scenario analysis for other eventualities that pose material, and even greater, risk. Third, if the proposal’s only point is that banks should take material climate-related risk into account on the same terms and in the same ways as other risk, it should just say so, in the form of a simple reminder that the same requirements of assessing material risk with a view to safety and soundness apply to all kinds of risk. The largest banks, to which the Proposed Principles are directed, do not need more prompting to pay attention to climate-related risk as compared to other sorts of risk. Just the opposite is true. Such a reminder would in fact be unnecessary because the largest banks have shown a pronounced propensity to engage on issues surrounding climate-related risk.25 Because no guidance is needed to remind banks and examiners of existing legal requirements, there is no need for the Proposed Principles, and their issuance would therefore be arbitrary and capricious. 22 See id. at p. 2. 23 See id. at p. 4. 24 See id. at p. 4. 25 See, e.g., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Sustainability, https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/ sustainability/es- commitments; Citigroup, Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Report 2021, https://www.citigroup.com/citi/sustainability/data/taskforce-on-climate-related-financial-disclosures-report- 2021.pdf?linkId=148731631; Wells Fargo, Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-responsibility/climate-disclosure.pdf. 5
If the OCC is determined to act in this space, it should prepare guidance for every type of eventuality that poses a level of risk similar to that assertedly presented by climate change and should present a reasoned basis for singling out these types of eventualities as presenting higher degrees of risk than other types. The OCC’s failure even to ask whether singling out climate- related risk is needed, let alone to answer that question in the affirmative, is the essence of arbitrary decision-making. The proposal’s irrationality is exacerbated by the fact that, as we establish below, its directives are mandatory, although the proposal would be irrational even if optional. At the very least, the OCC should add to the proposal text making clear that banks are not required to treat climate-related risk differently than any other sort of risk. OCC Must Consider the Negative Effects The Proposed Principles will have considerable negative effects. OCC must consider these before adopting the Proposed Principles. A regulation that fails to weigh its benefits against its costs is irrational.26 Yet the proposal fails even to identify its costs, let alone assess whether the benefits it purports to achieve justify them. The Proposed Principles would impose serious real-world costs on banks, on the businesses to whom they lend, and on American citizens who depend on those businesses for their livelihoods and for goods and services and on the banks. By singling out climate-related risk for special treatment the Proposed Principles would force banks to implement procedures that are not justified by the prevention of financial harm— as indicated by the fact that the OCC does not require those procedures for comparable risk of other types. This may also empower litigation by activists and others seeking to influence or claim against the banks. This would pointlessly increase operating costs for banks, which will pass on these costs to customers. All these costs would be most heavily borne by small businesses, who will more often lack the resources to absorb an increase in the cost of credit or to modify their operations to cater to the demands of banks to avoid activities that generate climate-related risk. By requiring banks to treat climate-related risk more sensitively than risks of other types, the proposal would drive banks to assemble portfolios that are inefficient. Indeed, by driving banks to assemble portfolios weighted toward businesses that putatively represent low climate risk, the proposal would make portfolios less diverse and hence will increase risk in the banking system. Moreover, while the Proposed Principles purport to only target large banks they will inevitably affect community banks and credit unions. Banks would be encouraged to exclude areas of the economy. By singling out climate- related risk for special caution in the provision of credit, the Proposed Principles would prompt banks to deny credit, or offer credit on worse terms, to businesses that might be alleged to pose climate-related risk. This includes businesses such as mining and electric power companies, as well as others that may be alleged to be at risk from possible changes in law or public opinion regarding climate change. Because the proposal directs banks to consider climate-related risks to 26 Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743 (2015). 6
“the bank’s reputation,”27 banks would be forced to consider whether loan applicants are in favor with green activists or are green enough. Banks may (in good faith or otherwise) interpret the proposal to require that they lend only to businesses that make certain green commitments (net zero emissions by 2050, etc.). Businesses that are accused of or perceived as harming the climate may find it hard to obtain credit and/or reasonable loan terms. Banks may even believe they must refuse standard transactional services, such as banking accounts, to businesses that are in disfavor with green activists. Businesses that operate in regions that may be alleged to be exposed to climate risk, such as coastal or forested areas, would also find it harder and more expensive to obtain credit. Indeed, the proposal suggests that banks should “determine … lending limits” by reference to geographic location.28 This harm would extend to states whose economies rely on energy generation. The Proposed Principles will also hurt American citizens. As credit for businesses posing “climate risk” dries up, the Americans who work for those businesses or for other businesses who depend on them for goods or services would find their livelihoods in peril. Americans would find it harder to start small businesses alleged to pose such risks. Further, under the Proposed Principles, Americans who happen to live in areas that the banks may believe are at higher climate risk would find it harder to get home and business loans. And Americans would face higher charges for essential goods like electricity as the cost of credit for such goods increases. Americans would also suffer as towns—especially in rural America—lose businesses on which they depend for jobs that sustain a viable community life. Americans would further suffer from the broader societal risks inherent in the green policies that the proposal is meant to further. These policies risk creating economic downturns, undermining grid reliability, and impeding American trade competitiveness, to name just a few. But the Proposed Principles do not even acknowledge, let alone attempt to fathom, these risks, or to offset them against the asserted risks it addresses. The Proposed Principles fail to assess not just costs, but also benefits. It claims that its approach will enhance bank safety and soundness, but it does not establish a baseline of current bank practices with respect to climate-related risk or show how the approach taken in the proposal differs from that approach. Without such information, it is impossible to know whether the proposal marks any advance over current levels of safety and soundness and hence whether it is necessary. A regulation aiming at a problem is “highly capricious if that problem does not exist.”29 27 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at pp. 3, 5. 28 See id. at p. 4. 29 Alltel Corp. v. FCC, 838 F.2d 551, 561 (D.C. Cir. 1988). 7
Any rational approach to risk management, including climate-related risk, requires a robust cost-benefit analysis relying on rigorous economic, industrial, and consumer studies. But among its many questions, the Proposed Principles fail to ask about the costs and benefits of its mandates. If the OCC mistakenly elects to continue with this rulemaking, it should before finalization issue a request for information seeking the data it needs to assess and compare costs and benefits, then give careful heed to that data in any eventual finalization. Proposed Principles Force Banks to Account for Immaterial and Speculative Risk The Proposed Principles force banks to monitor and account even for speculative and immaterial risks. Despite having a stated purpose of helping banks manage risk arising from climate change, the Proposed Principles do not explain the nature and scope of that risk, leaving banks to feel their way blindly on this decisive question, or to guess what will best keep them out of regulatory audits and litigation. Predictions about the physical risks of climate change vary wildly, ranging from increasing numbers of hurricanes and wildfires to destruction from climate-driven great-power conflict or even more speculative claims.30 And predictive climate science is in its infancy.31 For these reasons the obstacles to understanding the risk of various climate eventualities, especially decades into the future, are immense. Yet the proposal fails to offer principles by which banks can determine which asserted physical risks are realistic in the OCC’s view and therefore should be considered. Further, the proposal demands that banks monitor and account for risk arising from climate-driven changes to the legal framework. But regulatory and (especially) legislative action is notoriously difficult to predict, and the Proposed Principles do not offer any means by which banks may weed out probable from speculative future regulatory and legislative developments or any safe harbors on which banks may rely in making judgments about such future government action. Faced with the proposal’s demand that banks monitor and respond to climate-related risk and the OCC’s refusal to explain which sorts of alleged risk are of concern, banks will have no choice but to err on the side of caution. Rather than run afoul of the OCC, they will take an unwarrantably and unpredictably expansive view of the risks of climate change, exacerbating the harms to the banking system, small businesses, and Americans discussed in the preceding section. Indeed, the proposal sanctions this approach: it urges banks to adopt “measures of conservatism” in the face of uncertainty.32 For this reason, too, the OCC should not finalize this proposal. If it does choose to finalize, then it should make clear that banks may form their own judgments about the likelihood 30 See Elizabeth Kolbert, “Three Scenarios for the Future of Climate Change,” New Yorker (Oct. 5, 2020). 31 The proposal itself admits that climate “[d]ata, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at a rapid pace.” P. 3. 32 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 5. 8
and magnitude of various asserted climate-driven eventualities and that the OCC will not second- guess those judgments. This is Rulemaking, Not Guidance The Proposed Principles are legislative rules masquerading as guidance. The OCC must treat it as a legislative rule. The “hallmark of legislative rules” is “[e]xpanding the footprint of a regulation by imposing new requirements, rather than simply interpreting the legal norms Congress or the agency itself has previously created.”33 The Proposed Principles expand the regulatory footprint in two ways. First, it decides once and for all that climate-related financial risk poses a graver risk to bank safety and soundness than other sorts of risk and therefore warrants special treatment. Regulated banks are no longer free to make their own prudential assessment in this area, as they do in others; they must act as though climate-related risk is of especially great concern. Second, the proposal establishes several concrete new requirements for regulated banks. See supra. Neither of the above represents a mere interpretation of existing legal duties.34 Indeed, the proposal does not cite a statute or regulation. It appears to deduce the new requirements from the general duty of safety and soundness,35 but that general standard neither singles out climate- related risk for special treatment nor creates the particular duties the proposal demands. The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would have binding force. The proposal binds banks to single out climate-related risk as of special concern. Banks under the OCC’s jurisdiction must remain safe and sound.36 The Proposed Principles declare the OCC’s position that climate- related financial risk implicates safety and soundness in an especially serious way.37 Banks are no longer free to reach their own conclusions on this issue. This determination from the OCC’s headquarters controls the actions of its supervisory staff. The OCC has a statutory duty to preserve safety and soundness.38 Its staff therefore cannot allow supervised banks to engage in behavior that the agency has determined would imperil safety and soundness.39 The proposal leaves OCC supervisory staff no opportunity for reaching different conclusions about climate- related risk; indeed, the proposal makes clear that the staff’s “supervisory expectations” will be 33 Iowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 873 (8th Cir. 2013); see also Gen. Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, 742 F.3d 1561, 1565 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (rule is legislative when it “create[s] … new rights or duties”). 34 See, e.g., Iowa League of Cities, 711 F.3d at 875 (legislative rule exists where no “preexisting … legislative rule … supplies the basis for the prohibition” in guidance). 35 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 2. 36 12 U.S.C. § 1(a). 37 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 1. 38 12 U.S.C. § 1. 39 OCC, Comptroller’s Handbook: Large Bank Supervision 11 (2019) (“If examiners determine that a risk is … not effectively managed … they must communicate to bank management and the board the need to mitigate or eliminate the unwarranted risk.”) (emphasis added). 9
shaped by the framework offered in the proposal.40 The OCC staff who closely supervise large banks must therefore require the banks they supervise to treat climate-related risk as the proposal demands. Because regulated banks know this, they must accept the proposal’s determination about climate-related risk if they do not wish for adverse action by their examiners. This is why the proposal simply assumes that banks will “incorporate[e] these principles [of the proposal] into their risk management systems.”41 It does not even consider whether banks might decline to accept this purported “guidance.” The Proposed Principles therefore resemble the EPA guidance found binding in Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015 (D.C. Cir. 2000), and Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311 (D.C. Cir. 2011), both of which committed agency staff—and therefore by extension the public regulated by those staff—to the positions taken by guidance. Indeed, the proposal presents the concerns in these cases in an aggravated form, for the OCC’s supervisory power is among the broadest and most powerful known to law. Regulated banks, as chartered entities, owe their very existence to the OCC. Moreover, examiners are on-site at large regulated banks at all times, with authority to “require action by bank management to address deficiencies before [they] compromise the bank’s safety and soundness.”42 The Proposed Principles also bind banks to implement its particular demands. The proposal states that an “effective risk governance framework is essential to a bank’s safe and sound operation,”43 and that such governance “includes” certain specific climate-related measures such as “assigning climate-related financial risk responsibilities throughout the organization.” Per the proposal, regulated banks that treat climate-related risk like other risks, rather than singling it out for, e.g., “assign[ment] … throughout the organization,” will fail at an “essential” element of safety and soundness. Similarly, the proposal often asserts that banks “should” comply with its demands. While this word can sometimes merely recommend, here the Proposed Principles make clear that banks “should” undertake the demanded measures if they want to remain safe and sound—and they are required by law to remain safe and sound. The guidance does not disclaim that it is binding or anywhere inform banks or the public that it does not bind. 40 P. 2; see also Community Nutrition Inst. v. Young, 818 F.2d 943, 946 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (explaining that the fact that a document constrains an agency’s discretion tends to show it is a legislative rule). 41 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 6. 42 Comptroller’s Handbook at 14. 43 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-138a.pdf, at p. 2 (emphasis added). 1 0
The OCC should therefore admit that the proposal, if finalized, would constitute a legislative rule subject to the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The OCC should withdraw the proposal and (if it mistakenly chooses to proceed with the rulemaking) should reissue it with the full set of findings and analyses that ordinarily accompany a rulemaking. Further, the OCC should explain why a binding rulemaking, rather than optional guidance, is appropriate in these circumstances. Nothing in the proposal addresses this question, but a rulemaking that fails to engage whether a rulemaking (rather than guidance) is necessary at all is arbitrary and capricious. As Guidance, the Proposed Principles Violate OCC Regulations The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would violate the OCC’s own regulations because they would create a binding rule through purported guidance. Just a year ago, the OCC issued a regulation providing that “supervisory guidance does not have the force and effect of law.”44 In the preamble to that regulation, the OCC explained that “examples … included in supervisory guidance (including guidance that goes through public comment) are not binding on institutions,” but are “intended to be illustrative.”45 Yet, as explained above, the proposal if finalized would create a binding rule, and the examples it gives of practices banks must undertake to protect against climate-related risk are mandatory rather than illustrative. Moreover, the proposal if finalized would be arbitrary and capricious because the creation of a binding rule through guidance would constitute an unexplained departure from the agency’s own past practice, as codified in the agency’s own regulation on guidance.46 That the proposal passed through a comment period changes nothing because the OCC’s rule on guidance commits the agency not to issue binding guidance even through notice and comment. CONCLUSION The OCC should not adopt the Proposed Principles. Climate-related financial risk is not the gravest threat to our banking system and should not be elevated to that status over economic downturns, foreign wars, or public health crises. The direct costs of compliance and indirect cost to businesses and consumers may be devastating, increasing already high inflation but curtailing credit to the energy sector and further burdening low-income Americans. The Proposed Principles favor and elevate social and political issues to the detriment of states, businesses, consumers, and our banking system. Moreover, the Proposed Principles are labeled guidance, but will be treated and enforced as rules. The OCC should withdraw the Proposed Principles and proceed with rulemaking. 44 86 Fed.

The authors argue that the proposal unjustifiably singles out climate-related risks for special treatment, despite other significant threats like economic downturns and public health crises. They claim the proposal will impose unnecessary costs on banks, which will be passed on to consumers, and could harm businesses, particularly in the energy sector, by making credit harder to obtain. The comment also criticizes the proposal for potentially forcing banks to account for speculative risks and for being a de facto legislative rule rather than mere guidance, violating OCC's own regulations. The authors urge the OCC to withdraw the proposal and engage in proper rulemaking instead, arguing that the principles prioritize political and social concerns over practical risk management."
kzn-k295-ojqm,"February 14, 2022 VIA ELECTRONIC FILING Chief Counsel’s Office, Comment Processing Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW, Suite 3E-218 Washington, DC 20219 RE: OCC Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Attention: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023-0001 To whom it may concern, Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund (AFREF) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC’s) Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We support this important step toward addressing climate-related risk in the banking system, and encourage OCC to strengthen and finalize the rule as soon as possible. In addition to this submission, AFREF has joined two other comments submitted to the OCC that focus on aligning banks’ climate commitments with internal strategies and governance, and fair lending, racial justice, and community development implications of the guidance. In this comment, we expand on the views of AFREF with respect to other topics and questions posed by the request for comment. In response to Question 1: Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? OCC Bulletin 2021-62 notes that “All banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks.” We agree, and encourage OCC, in collaboration with other banking regulators, to extend and tailor their supervisory guidance to banks of all sizes, including smaller institutions which may be more vulnerable to climate risk than larger banks due to the financial needs they meet and their more limited geographic range and product offerings. It is also critical that supervisory expectations encourage enhanced operational resilience to climate risks–especially for smaller institutions that provide vital banking services to underserved communities during and following disasters and other times of acute need–and that risk mitigation strategies broadly remedy rather than exacerbate economic burdens on lower income communities and communities of color.
In response to Question 3: What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? In recent years, many of the largest U.S. banks have developed net zero emissions commitments1 in recognition of the growing physical and transition risk that financed greenhouse gas emissions pose to their businesses, including through the traditional channels of credit risk, market risk, litigation risk, and reputational risk.2 The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)–now in use by 216 financial institutions worldwide–offers a credible accounting framework for banks and other financial institutions to calculate and disclose their financed emissions. Where data gaps exist, banks may still need more comprehensive, standardized information from operational firms to fully assess financed emissions and other climate risks on their balance sheets. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s upcoming climate disclosure rulemaking is a step in the right direction to make climate risk information more standardized, credible, decision-useful, and freely available to banks, investors, and other market participants. OCC should work with banks to integrate this new information into their risk management processes and strategies. Further, the OCC should make clear that having a transition plan is a crucial part of a bank’s risk management system, and work with banks to develop credible climate strategies and ensure that their public climate commitments are fully aligned with their internal risk management, strategy, and governance. In response to Question 7: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Market Risk Advisory Committee recommended in 2020 that “CFTC should coordinate with other regulators to support the development of a robust ecosystem of climate-related risk management products.”3 Products such as catastrophe bonds, weather derivatives, carbon offsets, and water futures may well be effective for risk transfer and hedging for individual financial institutions, but we are concerned that they may contribute to, rather than ameliorate, systemic climate risk that harms the financial system, consumers, and the broader economy.4 1“Big Banks Are Making Big Climate Promises. 3 Ways to Tell Who Will Deliver,” Forbes, 20 Jan 2022, https://www.forbes.com/sites/edfenergyexchange/2022/01/20/3-climate-actions-banks-must-take-to-fast-tr ack-net-zero-in-2022/?sh=5b1977595ff8 2NGO Letter to US Banking Regulators, “Bank Supervision and Climate Risk,” Sept 2021. https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Supervision-and-Climate-Risk-Documents.pdf 3CFTC, “Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System,” Sept 2020. https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8234-20 4See E.g., “Wall Street’s Favorite Climate Solution is Mired in Disagreements,” Bloomberg, June 2021. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-02/carbon-offsets-new-100-billion-market-faces-dispu tes-over-trading-rules?sref=f7rH2jWS
In dealing with climate risk–which poses a broad and deep emerging threat to financial stability and the financial health of communities and households across the country–risk transfer cannot be a substitute for true systemic risk mitigation.5 Insurers regularly use catastrophe bonds and reinsurance contracts to transfer physical climate risk to investors or other institutions, all the while investing and insuring the fossil fuel expansion projects that create carbon emissions, worsen climate impacts, and raise the chances of payouts due to climate-driven disasters.6 In 2020, a water futures market emerged on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange based on the availability of water rights in California, where droughts have become common and are expected to worsen as climate change unfolds.7 A December 2021 petition called for the suspension of the market, led by Food & Water Watch, a nonprofit, and signed by an additional 138 other organizations including AFREF.8 The water futures market may have negative effects on the real economy, discouraging water efficiency activities, and driving up prices for water–an essential natural resource and public need. Water is an unacceptable target for financial speculation. Carbon offsets, credits, and derivative products are commonly invoked within net zero transition plans, but credibility problems persist, and reliance on these products may delay emissions reduction investments and progress that is critically needed for systemic risk mitigation. A recent report from the New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch analyzed corporate net zero transition plans for 25 companies and found that “Companies’ plans to offset or ‘neutralise’ their emissions are especially contentious.”9 5Financial Stability Oversight Council, “Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” 2021. https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf 6Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, Letter to the Federal Insurance Office on the Insurance Sector and Climate-Related Financial Risks RFI, Nov 2021. https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.15.21-AFREF-comment-to-Treasury-FIO-o n-Insurers-and-Climate-Risk.pdf 7Yale Environment 360, “Wall Street Begins Trading Water Futures as a Commodity,” Dec 2020. https://e360.yale.edu/digest/wall-street-begins-trading-water-futures-as-a-commodity 8Food and Water Watch, “More than 100 Groups Call on CFTC To Shut Down Dangerous ‘Water Futures’ Market,” Dec 2021. https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2021/12/20/more-than-100-groups-call-on-cftc-to-shut-down-dangero us-water-futures-market/ 9New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch,CorporateClimate Responsibility Monitor 2022, https://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CMW_CCRM2022_v08_FinalStretch2.pdf “19 of the 25 companies assessed already know that they will rely on offsetting for their future pledges, and only one company plans explicitly without offsets (see Figure S3). At least two-thirds of these companies rely on carbon dioxide removals from forestry and other biological-related carbon sequestration (nature-based solutions) to claim that their emissions in the future are offset, i.e. that the impact to the climate is the same as if the emissions were never released in the first place. But these approaches are unsuitable for individual offsetting claims, because biological carbon storage can be reversed (e.g. when forests are cut and burned) and because there is a global requirement to reduce emissions and increase carbon storage, not one or the other. Claims of carbon neutrality today are often misleading; we identified significant credibility problems with all of the carbon neutrality claims form the companies assessed in this report, due to a combination of limited emissions coverage, inconsistent messaging, or procurement of low-quality carbon credits.”
Further, derivatives may help individual institutions hedge climate change risks in the near-term, but climate change is not a short-term challenge. Risks related to climate change will only increase over the coming decades, therefore banks should be encouraged to adopt long-term risk mitigation strategies that don’t depend on the availability of complex financial products and markets. The OCC should research the use and impacts across all of these hedging products in collaboration with the CFTC, the other banking regulators, and the FSOC to better understand the potential microprudential and macroprudential implications. The OCC should provide guidance to ensure that bank risk mitigation strategies do not contribute to untenable systemic risk or worsening of the climate crisis and the resultant exacerbated safety and soundness concerns. In response to Question 9: How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? The OCC must carefully consider the potential impacts of climate supervisory guidance on racial, economic, environmental, and climate justice, and how these expectations will interact with fair lending principles and regulation and consumer financial protections. Prudential climate financial regulation is vital, and it must not result in additional burdens on vulnerable communities and households, the very consumers who are most at risk from climate impacts. To this end, it is critical that the OCC expand its climate risk guidance to all banks in a way that recognizes the important role credit and banking services should play in helping vulnerable communities in building resilience to climate disasters. Such guidance should include how banks can and should maintain the operational resilience of the critical services they provide. It should also encourage both large and small banks to support community investment in adaptation instead of withdrawing credit, to finance green investment, and to protect consumers from unsafe “green” financial products that lack adequate consumer protections and/or do not deliver purported climate benefits. AFREF’s full views on the fair lending, racial justice, and community development implications of these supervisory guidance principles can be found in the coalition comment submitted on February 14, 2022 with 21 undersigned organizations. In response to Question 10: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? The OCC guidance should encourage banks to obtain additional information from their borrowers and other counterparties: ● Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions data,
● Information on planned capital expenditures on sustainable products and initiatives, and their likely impact on company emissions, energy and natural resource use, as well as transition plans, ● Geolocational information of all critical borrower infrastructure, ● Borrower climate disclosures prepared using the TCFD framework (banks should encourage borrowers to disclose this information using the TCFD framework to ensure that climate-relevant data is comparable across industries and geographies), ● Information about corporate impacts on environmental inequality, land use, natural resources, public health, and local economies. In response to Question 11: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? We recommend that reporting requirements should be expanded to include a series of line items to each applicable schedule about loans for fossil fuel exploration, production and fossil electricity generation, as well as securities backed by these assets and derivatives referencing them. As with real estate lending on the current call reports, these loans should be broken out by duration, with detailed information about allowances for losses on loans with terms of three or more years, which are particularly exposed to transition risk. The call reports should also add additional information about exposure of existing loan types to physical risks, such as separate line items for loans and asset-backed securities secured by real estate in flood zones or high wildfire risk areas. In response to Questions 12 and 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? It’s critical that the OCC develop climate scenarios–in coordination with the other banking regulators and the Financial Stability Oversight Council–and conduct system-wide scenario analysis exercises to assess the breadth and depth of climate risk within the banking system, identify areas of risk concentration, and inform risk management strategies for individual financial institutions and for microprudential and macroprudential regulatory interventions. These scenarios should build off of the work and best practices developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System and the International Energy Agency; they should include orderly and disorderly transitions coinciding with a broad range of extreme but plausible outcomes with respect to global emissions, climate sensitivity, tipping points, and speed of the energy transition. The OCC should also publish standard climate scenarios and work with supervised banks to run their own scenario analysis exercises and stress tests to identify risks and mitigate them in a safe and orderly manner, before physical impacts and transition shocks become unmanageable.
In developing climate scenarios and guidelines for scenario analysis exercises and stress testing, OCC should keep the following principles in mind. 1) Banks cannot rely on historical data to measure forward looking physical risk from climate change. Over the past four decades, the intensity, frequency and economic impacts of many types of climate disasters have increased nonlinearly,10 and these effects are expected to continue.11 Using historical data–even looking at the most severe events of the past–does not capture the severity of future storms, which will likely be far more severe and costly. 2) Physical and transition losses will likely be correlated and scenario analysis needs to incorporate shocks in series and in parallel, not as discrete events. Acute physical damages from climate disasters, chronic losses of productivity due to physical changes, transition shocks, and chronic transition losses and gradual write-offs of stranded assets will occur in parallel, in series, and interdependently. The increased frequency of climate disasters will likely deteriorate the financial resilience of banks and the communities they serve, and whether households and businesses will be able to continually absorb consistently increasing climate-related losses and remain solvent must be carefully investigated. 3) Scenario analysis must explore network effects within the financial sector. The financial sector’s response to climate disasters or transition shocks may include contagion, bank runs, rapid asset repricing, credit deterioration, and other network effects that lead to further financial instability. Modeling that doesn’t include network effects will likely underestimate the threat of climate change to financial stability. We thank the OCC for moving forward with supervisory guidance to better understand and mitigate climate risk within the banking system, and we encourage you to finalize these principles and begin incorporating them into the examinations process promptly.

kzn-me1s-xgus,"Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, DC 20219 February 14, 2022 Re: OCC Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu, We thank the Office of the Comptroller of Currency for recognising the serious threat that climate-related financial risks pose to the safety and soundness of banks and our financial system overall. As the first federal regulator to outline expectations for how banks should incorporate climate-related risks into their governance, planning and risk management, the OCC is setting a precedent for other financial regulators. The continued financing of fossil fuels is driving the climate crisis, placing our financial system and planet at risk — and the impacts of both the climate crisis and financial crises are borne disproportionately by low-income and communities of color. It is therefore imperative that regulators like the OCC act to ensure that financial institutions take the necessary steps to manage and mitigate climate-related financial risks, in order to protect the stability of our financial system, our communities and our planet. We urge the OCC to issue a strong final guidance We support the recommendations outlined in this guidance and propose some further measures: Accounting for Fair Lending Concerns The OCC directs banks to consider fair lending concerns when managing climate-related risks, “if the bank’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity”. This is crucial as low-income and communities of color may see their access to credit and other services halted as banks attempt to manage climate-related risk. We recommend that OCC acknowledge the risk to community banks under its supervision as these banks serve particular local communities and are especially susceptible to climate risk. Reducing financed emissions is the best way to manage risk for these banks and ensure continued service to local communities. Holding Banks Accountable to their Public Climate Commitments Many large banks have announced public net-zero commitments, and touted joining efforts like The Net Zero Banking Alliance. However, on closer examination, many of these public pledges amount to nothing more than greenwashing as these banks continue to invest billions in fossil fuels. JP Morgan Chase has given $317 billion and Wells Fargo has given $223 billion to fossil fuels since the Paris accords we signed in 2015. This guidance will hold banks accountable to their climate commitments by requiring that bank boards and management develop robust internal strategies to meet their public commitments. We further recommend that the OCC set clear and measurable targets for ending financed emissions in the near term, to ensure that banks’ internal strategies and transition plans are aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. It is imperative that the OCC recognises that many major banks, like Wells Fargo and JP Morgan Chase, require strong external guidance and regulation in order to reduce risk.
Climate Risk Planning Over a Longer Time Horizon The OCC recognises that climate risk is different from other kinds of risk, and that banks need to manage such risks accordingly. The guidance tells banks to plan for climate risks on a longer time horizon, highlighting the importance of “forward-looking” scenario analysis. This is essential as many of the impacts from climate change will become more apparent on a longer time horizon than the traditional 3-5 year strategic planning horizon banks use. Moreover, the risks associated with climate change are complex and unpredictable, which means that accurate quantification of climate risk may not be possible. The way in which climate and ecological breakdown proceeds is characterized by non-linearity, tipping points, and feedback loops in a profoundly complex, interconnected and ever-changing biosphere. Given these challenges and the potentially catastrophic and irreversible impacts of climate change, we recommend that the OCC adopt a precautionary approach, whereby tougher regulation is imposed on banks that are driving systemic climate risk by financing harmful activities, like deforestation and fossil fuels. As part of this approach, a measure the OCC should consider is increasing capital requirements for exposures that are particularly risky, such as new fossil fuel projects. The International Energy Agency’s 2021 report, Net Zero by 2050: a Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, makes clear that there can be no new investments in fossil fuel projects and that a net zero pathway “requires the immediate and massive deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies.” As such, the OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate. Sincerely, Positive Money US","The comment, addressed to Michael J. Hsu, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, supports the OCC's initiative to manage climate-related financial risks in large banks. It emphasizes the importance of incorporating climate risks into governance and risk management, highlighting the disproportionate impact on low-income and communities of color. The comment urges the OCC to issue strong guidance and suggests additional measures, such as considering fair lending concerns and holding banks accountable to their climate commitments. It criticizes banks for ""greenwashing"" and calls for clear targets to reduce financed emissions. The comment also advocates for a precautionary approach, recommending increased capital requirements for risky exposures like fossil fuels, and stresses the need for long-term climate risk planning. It concludes by urging the OCC to use its authority to enforce strong guidance and protect against unsafe banking practices."
kzn-meke-v5yp,"William Michael Cunningham Economist and Impact Investing Researcher Monday February 14, 2022 Mr. Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency 100 F Street, NE Washington, D.C. 20549-1090 Dear Mr. Hsu, We understand that “The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has identified the effects of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy as presenting emerging risks to banks and the financial system.” The OCC is inviting public feedback on a set of “draft principles..for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks..” Given the fact that incompetence, anti-Black discrimination and exclusionary practices based on race are currently operational in investment and finance, including at the OCC and other regulatory bodies, we decline to directly address the questions raised, having done so over the past 30 years. Additional specific input would be futile. We note, however, Mr. Cunningham (WMC) has long been concerned with the failure of bank and financial institution regulatory agencies to protect the public interest. We base this on the following: • We stated, on February 5, 2015, in testimony to the Norwegian Ministry of Finance (http://www.creativeinvest.com/NorwayTestimonyFeb52015.pdf ) and on April 22, 2015 in testimony to the Government of the United Kingdom: “As the market value of environmental, social and governance factors continues to grow, companies and investment managers will engage in fraudulent practices related to these factors. These practices will range from simple falsification of environmental, social and governance records to more sophisticated, but no less fraudulent methods related to environmental, social and governance ratings.” On September 22, 2015 automaker Volkswagen admitted that “’defeat devices’ used to cheat emissions testing were installed in 11 million vehicles worldwide.” • WMC designed the first mortgage security backed by Targeted Energy Efficient Mortgages in June 2006. https://www.creativeinvest.com/EnergyEfficientMortgageMBSJune2006.pdf info@creativeinvest.com www.creativeinvest.com 1
William Michael Cunningham Economist and Impact Investing Researcher • On July 3, 1993, WMC wrote to SEC Commissioner Mary Schapiro to notify the Commission about a certain, specific investing ""scam."" A timely warning was not issued to the investing public and members of the public were damaged. See: https://www.creativeinvest.com/SECNigerianLetter.pdf • WMC designed the first mortgage security backed by home mortgage loans to low- and moderate-income persons and originated by minority-owned institutions. (See: Security Backed Exclusively by Minority Loans, at https://www.creativeinvest.com/mbsarticle.html ) • In October, 1995, the Washington Gas Light (WGL) Company retained WMC to create mortgage-backed securities (MBS) consisting of one to four family residential home loans originated by minority-owned financial institutions serving areas of high social need. Mr. Cunningham developed a completely original approach that involved geocoding and mapping, for the first time, the location of every loan in an MBS pool and tying that location to social data. A sample map WMC created in 1997 for this process is attached as Appendix A. • On April 30, 1997, in Case 97-1256 at the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, Mr. Cunningham opposed the merger of Citigroup and Travelers and the elimination of the Glass–Steagall Act. • In November, 1997 and, again in December, 2003, WMC wrote to the Division of Market Regulation at the Securities and Exchange Commission, on behalf of WMC and Creative Investment Research to request that CIR be considered a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (""NRSRO""). WMC requested this status only with respect to rating securities issued by financial institutions owned by women and minorities. WMC never received a reply from the Commission. We have attached a copy of a letter sent to Ms. Nazareth, Director, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, as Appendix B. • In October 1998, in a petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in opposition to the Citigroup/Travelers merger, we cited evidence that growing financial market malfeasance greatly exacerbated risks in financial markets, reducing the safety and soundness of large financial institutions. We went on to note that: info@creativeinvest.com www.creativeinvest.com 2
William Michael Cunningham Economist and Impact Investing Researcher “The nature of financial market activities is such that significant dislocations can and do occur quickly, with great force. These dislocations strike across institutional lines. That is, they affect both banks and securities firms. The financial institution regulatory structure is not in place to effectively evaluate these risks, however. Given this, the public is at risk.” On July 25, 2012, the New York Times reported that Sanford I Weill, former chairman and chief executive of defendant Citigroup “called for a wall between a bank’s deposit-taking operations and its risky trading businesses. In other words, he would like to resurrect the regulation (Glass-Stegall) that he once fought.” • On June 15, 2000, we testified before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE’s) of the US Congress. We suggested that the GSE’s (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) be subject to a thorough “Social Audit.” A Social Audit is an examination of the performance of an enterprise relative to certain social objectives. It also includes a review of ethical practices at the firm. Had they been subject to this audit, certain flaws in their operation which led to their failure, including ethical shortcomings, may have been revealed earlier.

See: Property Flipping Remediation Yields Investment- grade Security at: http://www.creativeinvest.com/remediation.pdf and https://www.creativeinvest.com/PropertyFlipping.pdf • On December 22, 2003, statistical models we created using the Fully Adjusted Return® Methodology predicted the financial crisis of 2008. See page 6: http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s71903/wmccir122203.pdf • On Monday, April 11, 2005, we testified before Judge William H. Pauley III in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of investors at a fairness hearing regarding the $1.4 billion-dollar Global Research Analyst Settlement. • In 2005, we served as an expert witness for homeowners in a case against PMI Group, Credit Suisse First Boston, Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, Fairbanks Capital Corporation, Select Portfolio Servicing, US Bank National Association, as info@creativeinvest.com www.creativeinvest.com 3

Pauley III in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of the public at a fairness hearing regarding the $1.4 billion-dollar Global Research Analyst Settlement. See: https://creativeinvest.com/fairness.html • On December 22, 2005, Mr. Cunningham met with Ms. Elaine M. Hartmann of the Division of Market Regulation at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. At that meeting, he issued a strongly worded warning that system-wide economic and market failure was a growing possibility. • On February 6, 2006, statistical models created by WMC using the Fully Adjusted Return ® Methodology signaled the probability of system-wide economic and market failure. (See page 2: http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s71005/wcunningham5867.pdf ) • On June 18, 2009, WMC testified before the House Ways and Means Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee at a joint hearing with the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology of the Financial Services Committee concerning ways to improve the New Markets Tax Credit Program.

William Michael Cunningham Economist and Impact Investing Researcher Our economic models clearly predict the outcome of this and related regulatory efforts. Detailing and describing these outcomes would serve no purpose other than to enrich a set of non-African American individuals and entities while simultaneously damaging the public. While we decline to do so, note the following: As Mr. Cunningham has demonstrated, inadequate consideration of the public interest damaged the public and investors.1 Current regulatory practices protect the monetary interest of a small set of non-African American persons, fail to protect the general public, and damage the Country’s long term economic prospects. 1 For example, see: Fed Unveils Stricter Trading Rules Amid Fallout From Ethics Scandal.

kzn-moj7-j8qm,"Docket ID OCC-2021-0023 Comments of Jupiter Intelligence on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks February 14, 2022 Jupiter Intelligence (Jupiter) appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments in response to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) Request for Feedback on its draft “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.”1 Jupiter is a company that predicts risks from weather and climate change. Jupiter’s data analytics and services help public and private sector entities assess and manage the physical risks of extreme weather events, often referred to as perils, including floods, wildfires, or hurricanes. Jupiter’s world-class ClimateScore™ risk platform provides extremely accurate predictions – at exceptionally high spatial resolutions – of extreme weather events from the asset to the portfolio level, and in time horizons ranging from a few hours to several decades from now. Jupiter’s products combine weather prediction, climate and engineering models, and cutting-edge machine learning (ML), cloud computing, satellite data, and more. As of this submission, one-half of the U.S.’s largest banks and government sponsored enterprises subscribe to Jupiter’s climate analytics services, including what apparently is the most advanced and sophisticated bank implementation to date. Additionally, Jupiter’s tools are already used by several federal, state, and city agencies, as well as by a broad range of private sector entities across critical infrastructure sectors, including the financial, insurance, energy, and housing sectors.2 While Jupiter is not the only company or entity with this type of tool, the company is widely regarded as one of the leaders in market adoption, science, and technology. When decision makers have access to such weather and climate risk prediction capabilities, they are better able to make informed planning and operational decisions that drive superior risk management, risk disclosure, and investment in resilient infrastructure in both short- and long- term time horizons that will help improve the resilience of infrastructure assets. In fact, WIRED Magazine wrote: “[i]if you run a business, or maintain a city, or plan power plants or highways or bridges, you’d like to know how bad things are, and how bad they’re going 1 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), “Risk Management: “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback,” OCC Bulletin 2021-62, December 16, 2021, Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback | OCC (treas.gov). 2 Jupiter supports the risk assessments and resiliency investments of some of our country’s largest corporations in energy, asset management, banking, insurance, and a host of other sectors, as well as the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and public sector customers in Florida and New York.
to get,”3 then this type of tool that incorporates climate change into its catastrophic risk modeling and disseminates easily-digestible data to public decision makers and those in the critical infrastructure sectors is essential. Jupiter is responding to some, but not all, of the questions posed in the Request for Feedback. Introduction and Overarching Comments At the outset, Jupiter would like to strongly recommend that these issues be viewed in the context that the most unlikely events can have the biggest economic impacts. This occurred in the global financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, neither of which were appropriately factored into risk management practices globally, and, both of which drove enormous tax-payer expenses to stabilize a battered economy. Often, the worst impacts of any event can be the result of a combination of several unlikely, uncorrelated drivers. Jupiter has consistently recommended that the Federal government require consideration of future conditions for any financial or physical asset it owns, subsidizes, regulates, or otherwise supports. In particular, there is a duration mismatch problem between the economic life of assets and portfolios, and the risk management practices of both the Federal government and the private sector. Current year risk is simply not a suitable proxy for future risk in a large number of economically-sensitive sectors and locations. According to the CFTC’s 2020 report “Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System,” and many other similar reports in the U.S. and globally, climate change already is threatening “the stability of the U.S. financial system” and nearly every critical infrastructure sector.4 Jupiter was founded in 2017, three years prior to the CFTC report, because it was already clear that weather-related physical risks were not well understood or acted upon, and that the impacts of extreme weather events were, and are, increasing in frequency and severity over time. Jupiter’s findings on flooding and other perils show “a significant underestimation of risk by insurers and financial institutions that pose a potential economic calamity.”5 The fiduciary responsibility of lending institutions requires action on climate-related financial risks. As the OCC finalizes these “Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks,” Jupiter encourages the OCC to consider the following recommendations: • Do not allow buyers of models to “model shop,” because doing so has led to an underestimating of risk, as occurred prior to the global financial crisis and is widely viewed as a contributing factor to it. Catastrophic problems caused by “model shopping” 3 Rogers, Adam, “Companies Can Predict Climate Catastrophes for You – as a Service,” WIRED Magazine, April 29, 2019. 4 Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, “Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System,” September 2020. 5 Jupiter Intelligence, “Banking & Insurance Special Report: A Deluge of Risk...and a Looming Crisis,” prepared for Miami-Dade County, Florida, January 2020. 2
are described in a Brookings Institution report, Origins of the Financial Crisis, as follows: “rating agencies essentially acted as proxies for regulators; indeed, an office as high as the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, depended on rating agencies to assess CDO quality. . . . Since the agencies were receiving substantial payments for this service, it created a clear conflict of interest.”6 • Establish a common set of scenarios, time horizons, approaches to probabilistic distributions, and metrics. Doing so would enable companies to better assess and manage changes in risk over o time. Such commonality also would facilitate and accelerate more consistent and useful comparisons among companies within a given industry or sector. Because economic impacts differ across industry sectors, comparisons within sectors will be much easier than across sectors. For example, understanding material risks from mortgage defaults, losses from property and casualty or business interruption insurance, and service interruptions in power, health care, and even national security require different metrics. As deemed prudent, the OCC’s Principles can begin as recommendations and can o phase in over time to become increasingly robust or stringent. Consider beginning with the largest 10-20 systemically-important financial o institutions, and expanding the number of institutions over time, and increasing the rigor of the Principles over time. Also, clearly communicate the anticipated evolution in scope and substance to facilitate planning among the affected organizations. Recognize that both the science and the policy assumptions are evolving. o • Harmonize domestic and global standards to the greatest extent practicable, so that affected U.S.-based multinational companies do not have to comply with multiple, differing standards at home versus in other parts of the world. • Encourage public sector entities to use risk management modeling comparable to the high-quality data analytics that already are being adopted by industry. • Assess physical and transition risks in an integrated manner, with standardized, common climate input data sources, to more effectively account for, correlate, and address the combined effects of these risks on financial stability. Require regulated entities to align assumptions for physical and transition risk, for example, assuming low transition risk, i.e., few policy changes and business as usual will more likely result in high physical risk (i.e., experiencing more extreme events and the impacts thereof). • Use current and future-looking, rather than only historic, data. Jupiter encourages the OCC principles to facilitate the use of current and future-looking, rather than historic, data and modeling approaches for climate-related risk management. More specifically, encourage the rapid transition from existing, backward-looking model systems – that are often decades old in their assumptions and data sources – to the latest generation of modeling approaches that employ new data types, and inexpensive, cloud- based, high-performance computing that are readily available and established throughout the private sector. 6 Baily, Martin Neil, et. al., Origins of the Financial Crisis, Brookings Institution’s Initiative on Business and Public Policy, November 2008, page 32, https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2016/06/11_origins_crisis_baily_litan.pdf. 3
• Recognize that uncertainty is an inherent part of planning and risk management processes; understanding and managing uncertainty is a core capability of sophisticated organizations’ established risk management processes. Climate-related data and derived metrics need to be clear, transparent, and easy to measure, monitor, assess, verify, and report. The following elements are critical to establishing sound data and quality metrics and models: • A consistent and global methodology to derive granular climate metrics. A patchwork of information based on different models, regional models, and differing o methods creates ambiguity and obscures uncertainty. • Methods for quantifying and accounting for some of the aforementioned uncertainty as well as for systematic errors (i.e., bias). Down-scaled data, so that the spatial resolution is appropriately suited to the peril or o hazard being considered. • Current and future-looking data modeled in such a way as to account for changes in the timing and severity of extreme events (e.g., what was a 1-in-100 year storm that now occurs once every 10 or 20 years). Recognize that the most damaging and extreme weather events can affect the tails of statistical distributions. Given the rapid pace and nature of change in the severity of extreme weather events, historic-looking data or models are inadequate. Consider that often the worst impacts are the result of a combination of several o unlikely, uncorrelated drivers, and that on a risk weighted basis, the most unlikely events can have the biggest economic impacts, similar to what occurred in the global financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, neither of which was appropriately factored into risk management practices globally, and both of which drove enormous taxpayer expenses to stabilize a battered economy. Data should be drawn from the most recent and well-populated climate projections o and based on the best verified science. While traditional catastrophe models (cat models) have formed the backbone of well- o managed underwriting for insurance and re-insurance of natural disaster risks for nearly 30 years, these models are not designed and are inadequate for climate risk management.7 Decision makers and industry sector representatives increasingly recognize the importance of using current and forward-looking data in climate-related risk analyses. • Assumptions in, and limitations of, metrics that are based on established global climate models (GCMs) should be clear and transparent. Such assumptions, inputs, and outputs, must be transparent and well-documented to help decision-makers explain consequent analyses and conclusions, even if confidentially disclosed to regulators and industry. Climate models have performed quite accurately for well over a decade and have o generally improved over time. However, like other models, climate models are not always 100 percent accurate. They can contain imperfections in their underlying assumptions and their ability to forecast, just like all other models, including those that use common macroeconomic assumptions to predict GDP growth and interest rates. 7 As an example, see: https://medium.com/jupiterintel/cat-models-f0fc7e890bef. 4
• Climate scenarios (e.g., Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) will evolve over time – and can influence policy development and risk management planning processes – as scientific knowledge evolves. Imperfections in underlying assumptions and the constantly-evolving state of o scientific understanding will continue to occur. At times, this can result in the creation of extremes in climate projections that predict warming beyond realistic physical reality, as happened in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models and was, in practice, rejected by the scientific community. Some models previously underestimated the amount of anticipated warming and associated physical impacts. For example, while the Paris Agreement set an increase in temperature of 2 degrees C as the agreed-upon global target, it, and subsequent scientific reports (i.e., IPCC), acknowledged a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees C would be preferable. As a result, the assumption that 1.5 degrees C warming was the likely scenario became the prevailing view for several subsequent years. However, an increase of 2 degrees C is now considered the best-case (i.e., not the likely) scenario. Banking regulators in other countries assume a best case of temperatures rising by 2 degrees C (i.e., 1.5 degrees C is no longer a plausible scenario). And, more recent scientific updates have led to worst-case scenarios that the world will warm by at least 4.5 degrees C by 2100.8 Complying with these criteria would help banks improve their management of climate-related financial risks. As noted in a May 2021 Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk, “the failure of financial institutions to appropriately and adequately account for and measure these physical and transition risks threatens the competitiveness of U.S. companies and markets, the life savings and pensions of U.S. workers and families, and the ability of U.S. financial institutions to serve communities.”9 8 Holtz, Robert Lee, “Climate Scientists Encounter Limits of Computer Models, Bedeviling Policy,” Wall Street Journal (WSJ), February 6, 2022, https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-change-global-warming-computer-model- 11642191155?mod=djm_dailydiscvrtst; Sorkin, Rich, CEO of Jupiter Intelligence, LinkedIn commentary on WSJ article, Febru ary 7, 2022, Rich Sorkin on LinkedIn: Climate Scientists Encounter Limits of Computer Models, Bedeviling. 9 The White House, “Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” May 2021, https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related- financial-risk/. 5
OCC Questions for Consideration Applicability 1. Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? As noted earlier, Jupiter recommends beginning with the largest 10-20 systemically-important financial institutions, then expanding the number of institutions and the rigor of the principles over time, clearly communicating the planned evolution to facilitate planning among the impacted organizations. Jupiter encourages the OCC’s principles to account for correlated risk, including supply chain risk, affecting a large portion of any bank’s overall portfolio. Tailoring 2. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? Given that climate change poses major risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system and its institutions, future OCC guidance could help banks better manage and adapt to climate-related financial risks. The OCC’s focus on large banks in these proposed Principles is appropriate, given that larger institutions have more human and technical resources as well as larger budgets to enhance their financial climate-related risk management procedures or practices. Jupiter commends the OCC for adopting this approach of addressing large banks first. Such guidance could help a bank develop its climate-related risk management practices in a manner that is commensurate with its risk profile. To maximize the effectiveness of these anticipated Principles, Jupiter encourages the OCC to provide a roadmap to banks, with clear expectations of how the Principles and any associated standards will evolve over time, as banks work to meet such emerging standards The OCC should also consider ensuring sufficient rigor and commonality to facilitate uniform, consistent evaluations and comparisons of climate-related data, models and analytics, scenarios, and time horizons. In addition, such standards, of course, should be based on sound, peer-reviewed climate science. Please see the Introduction to this document for more detailed recommendations that Jupiter encourages the OCC to consider, as it proceeds to develop guidance pertaining to climate-related data models, and analytics, that will be used by large banks. 6
General 3. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? Climate-related financial risks are an emerging threat to financial stability that only recently are being incorporated into corporate governance and risk management practices. The expertise needed to evaluate climate-related data differs from that applied to traditional financial risk management and the evaluation of financial risks. Few banks currently employ climate scientists or other technical experts with sufficient background to effectively and efficiently evaluate relevant data or any downstream models into which such data might be incorporated. Moreover, in some cases, the currently-available data is insufficient to model the extreme perils that are or will be material. Among the most sophisticated and forward-looking banks, capacity building to address these challenges with skilled labor is already far along, and the OCC should encourage banks that might not yet be as far along to build capacity to incorporate these principles into their risk management systems. The OCC can help by ensuring that any guidance or principles it issues contain clear, easily- understood standards for banks to use in evaluating climate-related data, analytics, and data products and in comparing climate-related financial risk among banks. Jupiter offers some suggestions for such standards, at least for potential initial consideration, in the Introduction above. With transparently and easily understood standards in place, large banks will feel increasingly comfortable in evaluating climate-related data products. Such standards and processes also will expedite the adaptation and resilience of our financial system to climate-related risks and will enhance banks’ management thereof. Current Risk Management Practices 4. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? As of this submission, one-half of the U.S.’s largest banks and government-sponsored enterprises subscribe to Jupiter’s climate analytics services, including what is apparently the most advanced and sophisticated implementation to date, with over 60 million locations assessed. The majority of banks and lenders are just beginning their processes for determining ways to achieve sound and effective climate-related financial risk management. As noted in the Introduction and throughout this document, when banks are able to select a standardized set of scenarios, time horizons, and probabilistic determinations, as part of incorporating climate- related financial risks into their risk management frameworks, their success in managing climate- related financial risk and overall risk improves. 7
In addition, banks sometimes use “first-pass” attempts to assess risk management. They are building on this approach, by incorporating climate-conditioned input data into existing legacy model systems. For example, the projection of the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio for home mortgages can be adjusted to reflect climate risks and then incorporated into existing mortgage probability of default (PD) models. This approach is both better than the prior approach and deeply flawed, and is usually the result of required haste in adjusting risk management practices. The OCC should strongly consider encouraging banks, lenders, and supervisors to rapidly transition to the latest generation of services using ground-up modeling approaches that account for the changing nature and inter-relationship of physical and transition risks into the future. Just as today’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress testing regimes bear little resemblance to those initially deployed over a decade ago, Jupiter expects climate risk management to evolve in complexity, and in the understanding thereof, over time. OCC’s guidance should be consistent with this anticipated evolution. 5. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? No response to this question. 6. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? Generally speaking, banks approach this in one of two ways: a prudent internal risk management approach provides banks with quality information regarding what time horizons are relevant for specific business units, use cases, and asset types to avoid material duration mismatch problems. More commonly, banks are waiting for clear regulatory guidance on what areas are subject to scrutiny and the relevant time horizons. Absent guidance on time horizons, some banks will make a simple assumption using the shortest time horizon they can justify, and underestimate risk during the duration of the portfolio. While location-specific geography and other factors can be case-specific, standards for enabling choice of time horizon(s), risk tolerance, and climate scenarios are extremely important to ensure consistency of information across and within regulated entities – within a given sector. It is important to emphasize that these timeframes should not be limited by excessive discounts that subject future generations to undue costs, due to present inadequate risk management. Climate risk is unique among financial risks in terms of the ongoing, repeated, and growing, nature of climate impacts from extreme weather events. The life of a particular asset (e.g., a 30-year mortgage) cannot be the only criterion used when assessing the relevant time horizons and discount rate needed for climate-related financial risk management. 8
7. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? The use of any products, practices, or strategies to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risk is extremely limited and embryonic, especially when compared to the use of reinsurance to transfer credit risk, as pioneered by the GSEs, AON and others. 8. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account–do banks offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? No response to this question. 9. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? To a very large extent, without other off-setting policies, LMI and other populations are and will be disproportionately impacted by climate change, because they tend to live in areas vulnerable to extreme weather events and climate change. If banks perceive increased physical risk in these areas, they could cease to lend money there, as reportedly has occurred in some instances. As banks reduce their risk, the risks to households and communities increases, because they could suffer the double impact of being trapped in increasingly vulnerable areas, while suffering negative economic consequences, including potentially the loss or degradation of their homes, and/or the collateral risk of depreciated property, unless they obtain federal, state, or local public financial assistance. This is an important issue on which Jupiter is already working with some large lenders to ameliorate, through its “Jupiter Promise” program for under-served communities. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting 10. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? Presumably, banks need a uniform and consistent set of data, metrics, tools, and models to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks. As the OCC advances these Principles, the recommended standardized approach herein would facilitate these consistencies and enhanced capabilities, including the ability to make comparisons across banks. 9
Location-Specific Data is Key to Effective Management of Physical Climate Risks Physical climate risk is inherently a placed-based risk. The effective management of physical climate risk requires detailed knowledge of the location of all physical assets. Such information has always been required for mortgage lending. Yet, for counter-party lending, the same focus on physical assets has not been a traditional part of effective risk management. Jupiter encourages OCC guidance to recommend the availability of granular, rooftop-level information for all relevant physical assets and that banks then incorporate this information into their modeled risk assessments. Similarly, the supply chain of any counter-party borrower should be assessed for risk, based on the exposure of its capital infrastructure to climate risks. Eventually, it might be necessary to disclose and track the latitude and longitude of all placed-based assets affecting a company’s operations. While such information might be hard to acquire today, the location of physical assets will be vital to understanding an entity's physical risk exposure. 11. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? Jupiter encourages the OCC, as it proceeds with these Principles, to consider ways to make them consistent with other relevant requirements, such as anticipated Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) climate risk disclosure requirements, to the extent practicable – recognizing the latter are not within the OCC’s jurisdiction.10 In addition, while providing flexibility to banks, uniformity of data, scenarios, time horizons, and so forth will facilitate more consistent information and comparisons across banks. Harmonization of standards globally will also help and is important for these reasons. In turn, such an approach would better capture banks’ exposure and resulting reporting requirements. Scenario Analysis 12. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? As of this submission, one-half of the U.S.’s largest banks and government sponsored enterprises subscribe to Jupiter’s climate analytics services, including what apparently is the most advanced and sophisticated implementation to date, with over 60 million locations assessed. 10 Jupiter has been encouraging the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to require climate-related risk disclosure, beginning with large companies and, ultimately, considering a phased approach to expanding such requirements. 10
The most sophisticated banks already have sophisticated in-house staff to incorporate these types of analytics into their existing risk and model risk management practices and are underway, with the biggest challenges being implementation and refinement at scale. Other banks are still building capacity to even properly evaluate their alternatives, while some simply resist the need for this type of risk management as an enterprise solution. 13. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? As the OCC proceeds with these Principles, Jupiter encourages it to consider the following criteria (as also reflected in the Introduction above). • Establish a common set of scenarios, time horizons, approach to probabilistic distributions, acceptable risk levels, and metrics. • Harmonize U.S. principles with global standards, to the greatest extent practicable. Jupiter encourages the OCC to issue guidance that adopts a rigorous approach to o climate data validation that is better tailored to a consistent and global approach than those currently advocated by the Bank of England. • As the OCC issues principles, consider facilitating an integrated framework for physical and transition risk management including by: Incorporate physical and transition risk feedback loops into scenario-based analyses; o and, Align analyses with the Task Force and Climate Related Financial Disclosures o (TCFD) pillars.11 • Use current and future-looking, rather than only historic, data. • Avoid a one-size-fits-all approach to assessing risk across industry sectors or use cases. • Ensure analyses are sector- as well as location-specific. When assessing material climate-related financial risk exposure, having data that is as granular as possible is vital. Regional climate peril indices that aggregate information can be useful for a quick visualization and assessment of risks, and for decision making, when materiality is low, but can mask important variations that significantly impact more material risks. Jupiter encourages the OCC in its forthcoming guidance to consider including a recommendation that banks use caution, when solely using aggregate regional or visual analyses to manage climate-related risks. One reason such a caution is important is that climate-related physical risks, like floods and extreme heat, vary tremendously over land surfaces and geographies. Averaging such risk(s) over large regions can lead to 11 University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL)’s ClimateWise, “Climate Tango: Principles for integrating physical and transition climate-risk assessment with sectoral examples,” January 13, 2022, https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/resources/publications/climate-tango-principles-integrating-physical-and-transition- climate-risk. 11
attenuation biases in the results12 and, consequently, to erroneous conclusions about the nature and materiality of climate-related physical risks. • Make risk management modeling available to public sector entities using high-quality data analytics that are comparable to those already being used by industry; The OCC should ensure high-quality input data sources are available globally (e.g., Global Climate Models, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) data/models). Regional Climate Models (RCMs), while useful in certain instances, may not apply globally. While using global input data is important, it also is important to produce and use more granular data and data analytics outputs. For (more) material risks, granular (e.g., asset- level) data is especially important. Implementing both of these approaches will facilitate enhanced consistency in terms of methodology and ability to make comparisons among banks. Jupiter encourages the OCC to consider recommending that banks provide documentation regarding the assumptions and limitations about the selected input climate data and their impact on downstream models and data products. Conclusion Over the last five years, awareness of the importance of climate-related financial risk management has grown dramatically. The availability of data, derived metrics, and services to facilitate climate-related risk management has matured during the same period, while costs have declined significantly, as well. The OCC’s Principles will further help large banks undertake more robust climate risk management. Other considerations beyond Return on Investment (ROI), including shareholder expectations and regulatory compliance, also merit consideration. As the OCC advances these Principles, it should consider ensuring flexibility to banks, yet should also consider enhancing the ability to better manage climate-related financial risk and make better comparisons across banks, by facilitating standardized, uniform, consistent choices of climate scenarios (e.g., best, worst, or most likely), time horizons, and approach to probabilistic distributions. Modeling climate risk management necessitates the use of consistent, high-quality data and analytics, and this includes yielding location-specific, granular data. Global harmonization among domestic and international standards would reduce compliance burdens, including costs, complexity, and more. That said, across industrial sectors, a one-size-fits-all approach is not ideal and, therefore, is recommended to be avoided. 12 Hsiang, Solomon, Climate Econometrics, Annual Review of Resource Economics (2016), 8:1, 43-75. 12
The current state of the science behind physical risk prediction is more than sufficient to support an integrated assessment of both physical and transition risks. Jupiter encourages the OCC to signal to banks that the banks should anticipate that OCC will be recommending an integrated approach to modeling physical and transition risks. Lastly, Jupiter strongly emphasizes that during the last fifteen years, the U.S. economy has been battered twice by problems that were not adequately modeled or planned for, in both cases – the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic – at enormous costs to U.S. taxpayers. Within this context, “bad actors” abused the public trust, with billions of dollars in fines paid by S&P and Moody’s for having sold biased model results. Similarly, entities whose economics are driven by Assets Under Management have already engaged in practices designed to convince investors that they were responsible stewards of the economy, while essentially engaging in business as usual. It is critical that the OCC consider the economic motivations and past history of suppliers in the market, when choosing whose data may be reliable for internal and external purposes. Jupiter again appreciates the opportunity to provide this feedback and stands ready to serve as a resource to the OCC, including by offering technical assistance. Sincerely, Rich Sorkin CEO Jupiter Intelligence 13","Jupiter Intelligence, a leader in climate risk prediction, comments on the OCC's draft principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. They emphasize the importance of using advanced climate analytics to manage risks from extreme weather events. Jupiter recommends that the OCC establish common scenarios, time horizons, and metrics to improve risk management and facilitate comparisons across banks. They caution against ""model shopping"" and stress the need for harmonized domestic and global standards. Jupiter highlights the importance of using current and future-looking data rather than historical data and suggests that banks should incorporate granular, location-specific data into their risk assessments. They also advocate for integrating physical and transition risks in scenario analyses. Jupiter warns of the economic impacts of not adequately modeling risks, drawing parallels to the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location, business model) to which these principles should apply? Banks with a business model, operating environment, or risk profile, regardless of size, which are concentrated in a market, industry, sector, or geographic area that is exposed to material physical and transition risks. Consideration should also be given to the size of the bank within the OCC Large Bank Supervision segment. II. How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? 1. Provide clear guidance on the required or recommended reporting and disclosure frameworks (e.g. TCFD). 2. Provide guidance on approach to climate risk. Is it trying to measure impact of natural disaster on safety and soundness of Banks, or is it trying to regulate Banks’ and Clients’ carbon footprint, or both? 3. Provide guidance for meaningful stress test scenarios based on operational geography. 4. Provide guidance on analyzing internal data, and climate-related portfolio analysis techniques. 5. Provide guidance on mitigating impacts to households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities, resulting from climate-related financial risks. 6.

OCC: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks III. What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the OCC further engage with banks to understand those challenges? 1. Challenges with getting proper, labeled data both internal and external datasets. 2. Challenges with raising awareness of the importance for managing financial climate risk. 3. Horizontal practices (peer review data), data aggregated by bank asset size, including within the Large Bank segment. 4. Determining which clients of the Bank are large enough and/or in a position to effectively manage and report on climate related risks. IV. What specific tools or strategies have banks used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? None currently. The bank continues to evaluate specific tools and strategies for incorporating climate-related financial risks into risk policies and frameworks. V. How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management? Under development. The bank continues to evaluate factors that will determine climate-related risk materiality. VI. What time horizon do banks consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate- related financial risks? Some risks are considered in the short to medium term (1-3 years), such as reputation risk, extreme weather events, and public policy decisions. Other risks are considered over a longer time horizon (3+ years), such as sector and geographic concentrations, demographic changes, operational resiliency, and geopolitical trends. Climate-related credit risks are considered on a time horizon commensurate with the tenor and collateral of the underwriting. VII. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do banks use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? CNB does not currently use specific products to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks outside of standard insurance (e.g. flood insurance for mortgage and CRE). VIII. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account– do banks offer to clients and customers?4 What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? 1. CNB does not currently offer green-products. 2. These products contain risks related to accurately pricing future climate impacts from both physical and transition perspectives. IX. How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? The bank continues to evaluate how to best consider and mitigate the impacts on LMI and disadvantaged communities resulting from climate-related financial risks.
OCC: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks X. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? 1. Banks need internal and external historical datasets, especially for private companies who are not subject to public reporting and do not have this information readily available, whether for themselves or for their clients. 2. Banks can currently obtain this information through third party data providers (ClimateWise, Moody’s ESG Solutions, Blackrock’s Aladdin), peer data aggregators (Moody’s), and internal data lakes. 3. These datasets are generally incomplete and often rely on black-box models for generating output. XI. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture banks’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? 1. Incorporate a light set of requirements within OCC Heightened Standards to ensure raised awareness, and to begin the process of building a Climate Risk Management program. 2.

How do banks use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? 1. The bank uses scenario analysis in its capital planning activities. 2. Challenges faced during climate risk scenario analysis include: a. Lack of clarity of expectations b. Data challenges c. Choosing appropriate scenarios and methodology d. Technical challenges in assessing impact (e.g. timescales, level of granularity, etc.) e. Limited local expertise f. Identifying opportunities, not just risks g. Usefulness for informing business strategy h. Resourcing and expertise XIII. What factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? 1. Size and complexity of the bank, and whether or not it is subject to CCAR 2. Availability of data. 3. Client willingness and ability to provide (i.e. small businesses) 4. Climate risk data vendor best practices 5. Analytics, scenario, and methodology best practices 6. Data strategy and governance 7.

kzp-ov4c-r43y,"February 14, 2022 Michael J. Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, DC 20219 Re: Docket ID OCC-2021-0023, OCC Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu, On behalf of the82undersigned organizations andour millions of members and supporters, we welcome the opportunity to comment on the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC’s) Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks. We support this important step toward advancing banks’ efforts to assess and address climate-related risk, and we urge the OCC to strengthen and finalize the draft as soon as possible. Climate change poses significant risks to the safety and soundness of banks, the financial system, and communities. We support the OCC’s recommendations for big banks to take a whole-of-business approach to mitigating climate risk, to consider longer time horizons for assessing and addressing climate risk, and to develop climate-related data and scenario analysis modeling. Two elements of particular importance include directing banks to align their internal strategies with their public climate commitments, and recognizing fair lending implications and the adverse effect that risk-management measures could have on low-income and other disadvantaged households and communities. Ensuring transparency and alignment of climate commitments and strategies We welcome the provision directing banks to ensure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public climate commitments. Public statements, like recent commitments made by banks to create and execute “net-zero” transition plans, are a reflection of management’s strategic vision for the company and an important part of climate risk management. To be consistent with its public commitments, a bank’s corresponding actions and internal strategies must be grounded in climate science and technological realities. Recently, nine US banks have made commitments to “net-zero” emissions by 2050, consistent with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5°C, as members of the bank-led Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) initiative under the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).
However, these banks are falling short of establishing strategies to meet these commitments and are still engaging in actions inconsistent with them. Many continue to finance new fossil fuel and other high-emitting projects or companies expanding their high-emitting activities. These activities are not compatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 or limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. This conduct raises questions about whether bank managers desire to follow through on these commitments–and are failing to do so–or are merely seeking public relations wins. The OCC should clarify banks’ understanding of how the agency will consider the relationship between transition plans and internal strategies. Among the most significant parameters to expand on are (1) aligning financing for activities, projects, and companies that drive greenhouse gas pollution with the bank’s own commitments; (2) providing measurable near term targets based firmly in climate science and technological realities; (3) and accurately accounting for the challenges posed by offsets. Robust transition plans are important not only to ensure that banks’ internal strategies are consistent with public statements, but also because planning for a transition away from greenhouse gas emissions is important for the safety and soundness of all banks, large and small, and for fair access of marginalized communities to financial services. While some banks, such as Amalgamated Bank, have aligned their climate commitments to science and understand the need to reduce risks for both it and the financial system, other banks need additional guidance from the OCC. Linking Emissions Reductions Targets and Financing Activity Fossil fuel expansion is not compatible with any science-based limit on global temperature rise or with meeting public commitments for net-zero financed emissions by 2050. Key tenets of the International Energy Agency’sroadmap for achievingnet-zero emissions by 2050include “no investmentin new fossil fuel supply projects”and“no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants.”Yet U.S. banks, includingJPMorgan Chase, Citi, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America, are the most significant financiers of fossil fuels globally and have continued to increase their funding despite voicing their support for the Paris Agreement and committing to net zero by 2050.Citirecently committed to a29% reduction in absolute emissions from its energy sector financing by 2030, yet the bank failed to provide a plan to stop funding fossil fuel expansion to align with its net-zero pledge. More troublingly, major banks such asJPMorgan Chase,Morgan Stanley, andGoldman Sachshave setinterim targets based on convoluted financed emissions intensity metrics that are difficult to compare and do not conform with the
reduction in absolute emissions that is necessary to achieve net zero by 2050. These contradictions raise serious questions about the sincerity of banks’ climate commitments or, alternatively, the soundness of their management processes and controls. To meaningfully align their business with their commitments, banks need to follow a science based approach to meeting absolute emissions reduction targets. Measurable Targets The OCC should make clear that banks committing to net zero by 2050 must have in place, and must implement, credible internal strategies that meet the imperatives of climate science, technological realities, and safety and soundness. A credible plan in line with public commitments includes short- and medium-term targets and metrics. Such milestones are critical not just to meeting the commitments, but also to avoiding a fire sale from banks trying to meet their commitments at the last minute. A credible plan should include milestones such as a 50% reduction in absolute financed emissions by 2030. Offsets Some banks may seek to rely heavily on purported “offsets” of carbon emissions from forests, wetlands, and carbon removal technologies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. But offsets have deep limitations such that they cannot be relied on to play more than a trivial role in any credible net-zero plan. The limitations include difficultiesquantifyingorverifyingavoided or reduced emissions,questionsabout theeffectivenessandpermanenceofnatural sinksthat may bethreatenedby human or natural impacts, concernsabout the reliability andlegal normcomplianceof promised reductions due toviolationsofIndigenous rights and treaties, the lack of technologies that arecredibleanddependable,and thepotential for fraud. For these reasons,standard settersare increasingly treatingoffsets only as a last resort to negate residual emissions that remain after financial institutions have directly reduced financed emissions as near to zero as is possible. Ensuring fair access to financial services We welcome the OCC’s recognition of potential fair lending concerns as banks mitigate climate related risks. The OCC should address two key ways climate risk threatens fair access to financial services. The first is through impacts to the safety and soundness of local banks. Eighty percent of institutions supervised by the OCC are smaller banks, particularly regional,
community, and agricultural banks. Some are more vulnerable to climate risk than larger banks due to the financial needs they meet, and they are also critically important for rural communities and marginalized communities. One in five counties depends on community banks for access to a physical bank branch. The second threat is through measures taken by large banks to reduce their own exposures to credit and other financial risks. Such bank measures are likely to include closing branches in “hot-spot” areas impacted by climate-related extreme weather events, increasing costs related to financing in these areas, and pursuing other measures that could reduce access to services. The guidance’s attention to disproportionate impacts is welcome. Banks may find that it pushes them in multiple directions. While the guidance directs banks to reduce their exposures, it also notes that some responses may be unacceptable due to disproportionate impacts to marginalized communities. The OCC should move quickly to issue additional guidance on how banks can improve on equitably providing credit to vulnerable communities while acting in a safe and sound manner. As part of this guidance, it should require that banks identify, measure, monitor, and address potential and occurring disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities, such as communities of color and low-moderate-income communities. Banks should have a system for tracking their actions to avoid or address disproportionate impacts and documenting their progress on addressing those impacts. It should also recognize that orderly reductions in financed emissions would most meaningfully reduce safety and soundness risks for all banks, large and small, as well as the risk of impaired access to financial services for all communities. Conclusion These draft principles are a historic step in the right direction. They are also a starting point that should be followed by additional guidance. The U.S. lags behind much of the world on mitigating climate-related risk. We encourage the OCC to follow the lead of global peers atthe European Central Bank (ECB),Canada’s Office of theSuperintendent of Financial Institutions, and other regulators who are actively exploring the need for additional supervisory measures to respond to climate risk, including the need for increasedattention to capital and liquidity requirementsat the largest, most complex institutions. We look forward to continuing to engage with you on these issues. For questions, please contact Anne Perrault ataperrault@citizen.organd Yevgeny Shrago at

Thank you, Comptroller Hsu, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. Even as banks publicly claim to be taking climate change seriously and phasing out financing for greenhouse gas emissions, they are investing billions into companies that produce fossil fuels. Banks’ continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change – a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.
I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: 1. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; 3. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 4. And make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments.
The OCC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate risk. The OCC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.","The comment expresses support for Comptroller Hsu's efforts to address climate change in the banking sector.

Johnson believes the policy contradicts its goals and should not be enforced by banks, which lack the resources to manage it."

The FDIC’s proposal follows the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) principles, proposed in  December, which marked the first time a federal regulator has offered expectations for how banks should  incorporate climate-related threats into their governance, planning, and risk assessments. The FDIC’s request  for comment kicks off a 60-day comment period after being published in the Federal Register.   In February, Public Citizen joined with over 80 other organizations to support and improve the OCC climate  guidance, providing detailed comments on the rule.   The U.S. lags behind much of the world on mitigating climate-related risk, and these draft principles are an  additional step in the right direction. The risks large banks face from climate change are broad and necessitate  meaningful changes in how they do business.  The FDIC’s guidance is a starting point as regulators consider how they ask banks to take action on climate  change. While many financial institutions would like to ignore their responsibilities to reduce climate-related  risk and cut risky fossil finance to a new generation of managers, the threats are too near, and the time to  mitigate them is now.  The FDIC’s role as a bank supervisor and deposit insurer put it at the forefront of determining the impact  climate change could have on banks, their customers, and the wider communities they serve.  Yours sincerely,  Robert E. Rutkowski  cc:

He emphasizes the broad risks climate change poses to large banks and the urgent need for them to adapt their business practices. Rutkowski argues that financial institutions must not ignore their responsibilities to reduce climate-related risks, as the threats are imminent.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to comment on your notice of proposed policy  statement on Statement of Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk Management for  Large Financial Institutions.    You are requesting comment on draft principles that would provide a high-level framework for  the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks. Although all  financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related  financial risks, these draft principles are targeted at the largest financial institutions, those  with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The draft principles are intended to  support efforts by large financial institutions to focus on key aspects of climate-related  financial risk management.    I agree with you that: “Climate-related financial risks pose a clear and significant risk to the  U.S. financial system and, if unmitigated, may pose a near-term threat to safe and sound  banking and financial stability. Weaknesses in how institutions identify, measure, monitor,  and control the physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could  adversely affect a financial institution’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial  system.”1 While measurement, assessment and quantification of climate-related risks is still a  growing area, the minimum expectation for financial institutions is that they should have in  place the appropriate focus and governance covering the overall topic. The recently     1 See draft principles, 87 FR 19509 (April 4, 2022), available at  https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-04-04/pdf/2022-07065.pdf

He acknowledges the significant risk climate-related financial risks pose to the U.S. financial system and supports the draft principles aimed at institutions with over $100 billion in assets. Barnard agrees with the FDIC's assessment that weaknesses in managing these risks could threaten financial stability. He emphasizes the importance of financial institutions having appropriate governance and focus on climate-related risks. Barnard references the UN Environment Programme’s Finance Initiative's Principles for Sustainable Insurance, suggesting that the governance steps outlined for insurance underwriting are also applicable to other financial institutions. These steps include establishing ESG risk appetite, integrating ESG risks, and reporting on them.

I currently serve on the ABA's  Climate Risk Task Force and we have been meeting regularly to discuss this issue and its  potential impact on the overall economy in general and more specifically its potential impact on  banking. This is certainly a timely issue and I'm glad to see that the FDIC is weighing in. While  the focus of this FIL is directed primarily to the larger financial institutions of over $100 billion in  total consolidated assets, I believe it is important that smaller community financial institutions  weigh in on this issue at the outset in order for our voice to be heard and our concerns be  addressed in this critical formulation stage.  Before weighing in on how climate related financial risk should be addressed, I think it's worth  mentioning that the whole topic of ""climate change"" itself is one that is not completely settled  as ""immutable science"". While data can and has been gathered that there has been an uptick  in weather-related events, there is no concrete proof that mankind or the fossil-fuel industry  are the culprits. What we may be experiencing is the normal fluctuations in climate that  perhaps have been experienced since the world existed.  Our current administration in Washington has directed that climate change be one of the  primary focuses of basically every governmental agency and we are definitely seeing the ""green  agenda"" working its way through the system. This raises concern and suspicion that this topic  has more to do with a political agenda than it does concrete science.  We are a small community bank in Northeast Louisiana with average total assets of $345  million. We do not make loans to any of the big oil companies directly but we do a good  amount of lending to fossil-fuel related businesses such as convenience stores and to  individuals who are employed in one way or another by the fossil-fuel industry. Regulatory  efforts to handicap banks from making these types of loans will not only hurt our bank, but  have a tremendously detrimental effect on our local economies.  In one of our ABA calls, it was mentioned by someone that most of the transitioning that will  take place will be as a result of market factors and not necessarily regulatory requirement. I  thought that was a good point to make. Our industry has witnessed fairly significant shifts in  business activity throughout history due to a variety of factors including technological advances  and changes in consumer behaviors and trends. I would be confident that we could once again  G----------- !ENDER  ·,•AINOFFICE • '20OAKSTREE- • P.OBOX8 • DE'HI  /o.71232 • 3181P1'<703 • r:,.x1  MEMBER  FDIC 
successfully navigate changes brought about by climate change without the need for extensive  regulatory requirements, rules, accounting standards, etc. Let bankers be bankers.  When it comes to investments in alternative sources of energy, I do not believe that anyone  would be opposed to such. But in my opinion, our technology has not matured to the point  that we could run our country on the present sources of alternative energy that we have such  as solar, wind, or battery. The fear is that the government, in an effort to pick winners and  losers, will put our economy and our country in serious jeopardy by pushing too quickly to turn  from our traditional energy sources. It will take time to develop the next generation of  renewables that can sufficiently handle the expected demand.  FDIC is requesting comment on specific questions listed in the Statement of Principles.  Question 1: The complexity of what is being proposed regarding measuring, monitoring, and  controlling risks associated with climate change can really only be attempted by the largest of  our financial institutions. It will not only be very difficult, requiring expertise that we certainly  don't have on hand, but it will also be very expensive. This will no doubt be a boom for  ""climate consultants"" who believe that their particular system will be the cure all. It is a daily  struggle now to comply with all of the regulations that we are currently under. Tacking on the  enormous task of figuring out climate risk just seems impossible at this point.  Question 2: Future guidance will obviously be necessary as the only things being mentioned at  this stage are very esoteric in nature and do not offer any concrete methodologies for even  how a small bank is to begin to start addressing the issues involved. From the conversations  that I have been witness to, it is difficult for someone who is not involved in climate-related  matters on a daily basis to even understand the terminology. Future guidance will need to be  at a level that would not require a doctorate to understand.  Question 3: I find it very difficult to understand what it will look like to ""incorporate these draft  principles"" into our risk management system. What are the questions that we need to ask of  our borrowers? Where do we go to find reliable climate data? What do we do with the data?  Question 4: Community banks will need particular risk management practices that are sensible  and easily established. Again, there are no established methodologies and there are  insufficient human resources available in our markets currently to assist us with developing  these risk management practices.  I have no responses for Questions 5, 6, and 7 as we are not currently incorporating climate into  our risk management process.","The commenter, a member of the ABA's Climate Risk Task Force, addresses the FDIC's proposal on climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. They emphasize the importance of including smaller community banks in the discussion, as these institutions could be significantly impacted by regulatory changes. The commenter expresses skepticism about the scientific consensus on climate change, suggesting it may be driven by political agendas. They highlight the potential negative effects of restricting loans to fossil-fuel-related businesses on local economies. The commenter argues that market factors, rather than regulations, should drive transitions in energy sources. They express concerns about the feasibility and cost of implementing complex climate risk measures for small banks, noting a lack of expertise and resources. The commenter calls for future guidance to be clear and accessible, and questions how to integrate climate principles into existing risk management systems. They stress the need for practical risk management practices for community banks and express uncertainty about how to proceed with the FDIC's draft principles."

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429    Re:       Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (RIN 3064-ZA32)    Dear Mr. Sheesley,     Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (“ICE”), on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries, appreciates the opportunity to  comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) draft principles for a high-level framework for  management of climate-related financial risks.1  We address our comments to several specific questions asked by  the FDIC with regards to these draft principles.   As discussed below, ICE is supportive of sustainable and impact  investing and regulatory initiatives designed to improve transparency and comparability.   We believe that our five decades of experience providing evaluated pricing and related reference data and  metrics covering millions of fixed income securities, which are largely held by financial institutions, can provide  useful insights into ESG-related practices.       Background on ICE   ICE, through its ICE Data Services business unit, is a leading provider of evaluated end-of-day and continuous   pricing services on approximately three million fixed income securities spanning approximately 150 countries  and 80 currencies including sovereign, corporate and municipal bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities as  well as leveraged loans. ICE’s reference data complements this evaluated pricing by providing our clients a broad  range of descriptive information, covering millions of financial instruments. ICE’s ESG data covers a wide range  of financial instruments including equities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS)  and loans.  Our municipal ESG data covers over 40 different demographic and workplace metrics which indicate  the potential social impact of investment in a given municipality.  In addition, these metrics are mapped to the  UN Sustainable Development Goals to provide users a means to look at their impact within a commonly  understood framework.  Our company ESG data2 includes widely reported and comparable ESG attributes and    1 https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22013.html  2 https://www.theice.com/data-services/esg-data/esg-reference-data   
    2    indicators (over 500), which can help users better understand ESG risks and opportunities of global corporations.    In addition, for most securitized products and municipal securities, ICE offers climate risk data3 on the exposure  of these securities to climate risks. This service can help users quantify climate risk exposure and make strategic  decisions across portfolios by maturity, obligor or geographical boundary.  Finally, ICE’s terms and conditions  data service4 includes classification of green, social and sustainable bonds, as well as details of any second party  opinion that confirms the status of the bond.       Climate-Related Financial Risk Time Horizons  The FDIC requests comment on what time horizons are appropriate for financial institutions to consider when  assessing the materiality of their climate-related financial risks.  In our experience, it is important to consider  multiple time horizons when evaluating the impact of climate-related financial risks.  Moreover, we observe our  clients commonly analyzing climate exposures over different time horizons for different asset types.  For  example, for short-duration instruments, our clients may refer to current exposure and the exposure at 1 or 2  years out.  For mortgage-related assets, the 7- and 10-year time horizons are very common focal points,  whereas real estate and municipal bond owners tend to look at 10- to 30-year time horizons. Climate risk should  not be viewed purely through a future lens, however, there are also material risks to real estate and  infrastructure now that should be considered. In addition, policy changes like FEMA’s Risk Rating 2.0 that was  initialized in October 2021 are expected to create inflationary pressure on housing costs through changes in  flood insurance premiums. Such changes may impact liquidity in the residential real estate market that could in  turn exert downward pressure on value of certain real estate markets.5  In addition, acceleration in wildfire risk  over the past several years is also leading to changes in the willingness of insurers to underwrite wildfire policies  for vulnerable real estate,6 potentially adding risk to banks holding loans. Financial institutions should be aware  of how these kinds of policy changes and market dynamics could dovetail with actual measurements of physical  climate risk.  We suggest that the FDIC recommend financial institutions consider a wide array of climate exposure time  horizons when quantifying the materiality to their institution.    Scenario Analysis of Climate-Related Financial Risks  The FDIC requests comment on several aspects of scenario analysis with regards to climate risk management,  including what challenges exist today and what factors should be considered when designing and executing a  scenario analysis.  ICE notes that there are well-understood climate scenario analysis tools available to the    3 https://www.theice.com/data-services/esg-data/climate-risk  4 https://www.theice.com/market-data/pricing-and-analytics/reference-data/terms-and-conditions  5 https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2021/10/08/flood-insurance-is-changing-for-property-owners-heres-what-real- estate-clients-should-know-414-210980/?slreturn=20220318112500  6 https://www.wsj.com/articles/wildfire-risk-in-california-drives-insurers-to-pull-policies-for-pricey-homes-11642593601 
    3    industry.  For example, the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)7 has established  Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP),8 which are pathway scenarios commonly utilized for climate  modeling and research.  These well-defined scenarios range from RCP 2.6 (representing the aspirational goals of  the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2100) through RCP 8.5 (considered by some to be the  worst-case scenario for climate change with expectations of projected warming exceeding 4°C by 2100).    These types of standardized, readily available scenarios can be incorporated into financial institutions’ scenario  analyses workflows and assist these entities in better understanding the potential of their climate-related  financial risks.    Additional Tools and Approaches for Risk Management of Climate-Related Risks  The FDIC discusses various risk management tools that are available today to financial institutions including  exposure analysis, heat maps, climate risk dashboards, and scenario analysis.  The FDIC goes on to inquire about  specific tools or strategies that financial institutions use to successfully manage climate-related risks.  ICE believes that all of these tools mentioned above add value to an institution’s analysis and management of  climate-related risks.   For example, dashboards and heat maps may be more appropriate for senior managers,  whereas exposure and scenario analysis are generally more appropriate for the managers more actively focused  on mitigating climate risks.     From our experience as a climate risk data provider, we strongly believe that the underlying thread that ties  these tools together is the validation of underlying assumptions utilized.  We regularly have clients asking us to  validate and compare our projections to actual outcomes once realized.  Therefore, we believe that the FDIC  should explicitly require financial institutions to research, outline, and detail the correlation between climate  risks and the financial risks to which they are exposed, and provide transparency into the data utilized to  validate any assumptions that underlie their models.      Application of Climate-Related Risks to Credit and Liquidity Risk Management  The FDIC highlights in these draft principles that a sound risk governance framework allows a financial institution  to identify and mitigate climate-related risks in various risk categories (e.g. credit risk, liquidity risk, operational  risk, etc.).  The FDIC further suggests that additional risk assessment principles will be provided in subsequent  guidance.  We caution the FDIC about being overly prescriptive in the application of climate-related financial risks to other  risk categories.  As a service provider in both the climate and liquidity space, ICE is still looking for ways to  appropriately incorporate climate events into its liquidity models, and correlations are quite difficult to apply on  a macro level.  With liquidity models that are broadly driven by underlying risk factors such as bid-ask spreads,  price volatility, depth of asset holders, and observed trading volumes (each of which are highly positively    7 The IPCC was established in 1988 and is comprised of 195 member states.  8 The RCP measure greenhouse gas concentration trajectories through the year 2100 and each of these RCP describe  different potential climate future scenarios. 
    4    correlated to liquidity), it is complicated to apply climate risk to these factors in a quantitatively, data-driven  way.      Conversely, on the credit risk side, there is ample data proving a strong correlation to climate risks and property  values, these data can be utilized to quantitatively model both an increase in the probability of default, as well  as the loss-given default assumptions used in credit modelling.       Conclusion  ICE appreciates the opportunity to share our thoughts on this important topic, and hope that our  recommendations are helpful as the FDIC develops a framework for the safe and sound management by  financial institutions of exposures to climate-related financial risks.  We would be happy to discuss these  suggestions in greater detail with FDIC representatives if that would be useful.    Respectfully submitted,   Anthony Belcher, Vice President, Sustainable Finance  Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.","Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE) provides feedback on the FDIC's draft principles for managing climate-related financial risks for large financial institutions. ICE supports sustainable investing and regulatory initiatives for transparency. They highlight their expertise in providing pricing and ESG data for financial instruments, which can aid in understanding ESG risks. ICE emphasizes the importance of considering multiple time horizons for assessing climate risks, noting that different asset types require different time frames. They suggest that financial institutions should consider both current and future climate risks, including policy changes like FEMA's Risk Rating 2.0 and increased wildfire risks. ICE also discusses the use of scenario analysis tools, such as the IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathways, to understand climate risks. They recommend that the FDIC require institutions to validate assumptions in their risk models. ICE advises caution in applying climate risks to other risk categories, noting challenges in incorporating climate events into liquidity models. They conclude by offering to discuss their recommendations further with the FDIC."

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention: Comments-RIN (3064-ZA32)  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429  Re:  Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN (3064-ZA32))  Dear Mr. Sheesley:  I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on behalf of my community bank that serves  rural counties in Northwest Alabama and Northeast Mississippi. My name is Brad M. Bolton,  President, CEO and Senior Lender of Community Spirit Bank, and I am a proud 2nd generation  community banker having served at this institution for the past 26 years. Our bank was chartered  on June 11, 1908 and has a long tradition of serving our communities with distinction. I am  honored to serve the needs of farmers, small business owners and consumers alongside a talented  group of employees who all have a focus and a desire to serve our customers in an exceptional  relationship focused manner.  I am writing you today regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles  for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am concerned that  the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community  banks. The proposed framework for managing climate-related financial risk management for  large banks would negatively impact my community and my customers if we were to be subject  to it and thus our bank is opposed to the implementation of any such risk management practices  as outlined.  While the proposal at present is intended for the ""largest financial institutions,"" statements have  been further made by the FDIC that ""all financial institutions should prepare for how you will  manage climate related acti,,ities in the future."" As implied by these statements and others, my  concern is that the climate risk framework for large institutions will ultimately trickle down to  small community banks like ours.  We are proud to provide deposit and lending relationships to gas and fuel stations, convenience  stores, truckers, farmers such as row crop, cattle, and poultry farmers as well as the timber  harvesting industry just to name a few. All of these small farms or small businesses could be  200 Fourth Avenue SW  P.O. Box 449  ' Red Bay, Alabama 35582 (256) 356-4445

I am extremely fearful that  the proposal, as presented, could ultimately choke off credit to legal and credit worthy  borrowers.  Community banks such as ours have been evaluating the risk of our balance sheets for decades  and already have mechanisms in place with existing regulatory frameworks to monitor and  manage all risk related to our portfolios. We do not need additional regulations placed upon us or  our custome1·s to better manage risk. Community banks such as mine pose no systemic risk to the  financial system and thus should not be subject to the same climate rules and frameworks as  institutions who do pose such risk.  Community banks like mine also have a long history of helping customers recover from weather  related events. Since our founding one hundred and fourteen years ago, my bank has dealt with  weather related issues in our communities, including tornadoes and severe weather on a re- occurring basis. When a catastrophe such as a tornado or other severe weather takes place, we  respond to our customers' needs, help them evaluate their loan balances, work out arrangements  to defer payments while insurance collects, and work with them on rebuilding when and if  necessary. We are there for our customers before, during and after these events because we have  relationships with our customers; they know us, and we know them. We are there for them in  good times and bad, and that is what differentiates a community bank like mine from large ""too  big to fail"" firms.  In reading the proposals, I am also concerned about ""scenario analysis"" that would require  specialized third-party expertise to perform these exercises. For a community bank or our  customers to be required to have this level of climate expertise would be cost prohibitive at worst  and at best drive up the borrowing cost for small business customers and potentially put small  business customers out of business. The small business customers I serve simply do not have the  resources to gather any such climate related data as would be required in these proposals.  Scenario analysis would require community banks to forecast for remote and speculative risks  and be of little practical utility to us because we are already familiar with our concentration risks  and how we manage them. My small farm and small business customers are very concerned that  they would be required to hire third party specialists even though there simply aren't enough net  profits especially among ""Schedule C and Schedule F"" tax return filers to obtain such reports and  analysis.  I would respectfully request that the FDIC refrain from implementing any climate related risk  management framework that could cut off credit to my borrowers. Neither they nor I have the  capacity or resources to create the litany of studies and data required to measure or calculate a  carbon footprint.  Climate Risk Assessment Comment Letter

While I  commend the FDIC for limiting this proposal to banks whose assets are $100 billion or more, I  encom'.age the agency to conduct further and more in-depth outreach with community banks to  better understand why this proposal should never trickle down or apply to community banks of  any asset size.

Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation -2- May 20, 2022     impacts and are devoting substantial resources to developing risk management capabilities to identify,  measure, and mitigate these risks.    BPI also appreciates that the FDIC Proposal aligns closely with the Office of the Comptroller of  the Currency’s draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (“OCC  Proposal”).3  As we described in our comment letter on the OCC Proposal, such consistency and  coordination will be crucial to avoid the potential for duplicative or conflicting requirements imposed on  financial institutions, which would not only be burdensome, but would also likely undermine rather than  support financial institutions’ abilities to manage climate-related financial risk.  To that end, we  encourage the FDIC, OCC, and other bank regulatory agencies to continue coordinating on any efforts to  finalize or expand upon guidance on the management of climate-related financial risk, and to do so  jointly via interagency guidance.  As concerns the substance of the FDIC Proposal, because the OCC and FDIC proposals are so  similar, we generally believe that our letter responding to the OCC Proposal applies equally to the FDIC’s  Proposal.  We therefore attach as Appendix A and incorporate by reference our February 14, 2022  comment letter to the OCC, which we submit as part of our response to the FDIC Proposal.   With that said, we note that the FDIC Proposal would deviate from the OCC Proposal in one  significant respect:  the FDIC Proposal would not merely create expectations for how financial  institutions manage climate-related financial risk, but also states that “the manner in which financial  institutions manage climate-related financial risks to address safety and soundness concerns should also  seek to reduce or mitigate the impact that management of these risks may have on broader aspects of  the economy.”  Although the FDIC Proposal does not further elaborate on this statement, we are deeply  concerned by any suggestion that financial institutions are subject to an affirmative obligation to tailor  their risk management activities in a way that mitigates the impact of those activities “on broader  aspects of the economy.”  Such an expectation is novel, has no basis in law,4 and therefore would be  inappropriate to impose on financial institutions as a matter of policy without further clarification.   Given the vague and ambiguous nature of the statement, it is unclear as to its application more  generally.  We strongly suggest the FDIC clarify its intent and consult more broadly with the other  federal banking agencies and the Financial Stability Oversight Council on any concerns over wider  economic impacts of climate-related financial risk management.    While of course all banks make risk management and other business decisions with a  fundamental emphasis on the impact of those decisions on their ability to meet the needs and  convenience of their customers and community, the introduction of a sweeping regulatory expectation  that a bank circumscribe and limit its risk management practices on the basis of those practices’ impacts  on the broader economy could undermine safety and soundness.  In practice, it could require that banks  sacrifice the effectiveness of their own risk management for the sake of avoiding any impact that such  risk management practices may have on the broader economy.  We also note that it is entirely unclear  from the FDIC’s statement (i) what “broader aspects of the economy” encompasses and (ii) what level  and types of “impact” would preclude a bank from pursuing a particular risk management measure.

See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1. 
Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation -3- May 20, 2022 all of these reasons, we urge the FDIC to strike this phrase from any final guidance, and further to  pursue any possible wider economic concerns through the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  The FDIC Proposal also requests comment on whether the federal banking agencies should  modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment  Act (“CRA”), to address the impact that climate-related financial risks may have on low- and moderate- income and other disadvantaged communities.  As noted in our response to the OCC Proposal (see  section V.B), we believe that the federal banking agencies should consider how activities designed to  improve the climate resilience of disadvantaged communities may receive CRA credit.  We believe that  financial institutions have an important role to play in supporting disadvantaged communities in  response to increased climate risks, and we welcome partnership with the banking agencies to further  this goal.  * * * * * Bank Policy Institute appreciates the opportunity to comment on the FDIC Proposal.

I.  Executive Summary  Given BPI member banks’ experience in this space, we believe six overarching principles should  guide the OCC in finalizing its climate-related financial risk guidance.  These principles and associated  recommendations are summarized below:   The principles-based nature of the Proposal appropriately reflects the diversity of climate- related financial risks to which banks may be exposed and the need for flexibility in the design  and implementation of risk management approaches in this area.    •  The Proposal should reflect that that there is significant variability of potential climate- related financial risk outcomes over longer time horizons.    •  The Proposal’s Policies, Procedures, and Limits section should retain its flexible  approach and acknowledge it would be premature at this time to require banks to  establish and apply quantitative limits or thresholds for climate-related financial risk.    •  The Proposal’s Governance and Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting sections should  permit appropriate flexibility in the design of reporting.     The final guidance should clearly acknowledge that banks’ approach to managing climate- related financial risk should be fundamentally risk-based, such that individual banks may tailor  their risk management programs to the risks presented and calibrate that program to the risks  identified.    •  The Proposal’s Risk Management section should clarify that for purposes of risk  management, individual banks will need to define “materiality” in the context of their  individual circumstances and risk appetite framework.    •  The Proposal’s Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting section should acknowledge that  an appropriate, risk-based approach may lead individual institutions to focus on  different aspects of their portfolios.    •  The Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section should acknowledge that banks have the  flexibility to conduct scenario analyses at appropriate, risk-based intervals.

Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -3-  February 14, 2022       The final guidance and its underlying expectations should reflect the fact that data and tools to  measure and quantify climate-related financial risk remain nascent and not fully developed.    •  The Proposal should acknowledge that, in the near-term, climate-related financial risk  metrics and reporting may be more qualitative in nature.    •  The Proposal’s Strategic Planning, Risk Management, and Other Nonfinancial Risk  sections should reflect the nascent state of relevant data.    •  The Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section should reflect the relative immaturity of  underlying data and methodologies.     The final guidance should acknowledge that it may be appropriate and beneficial for banks to  support customers through their respective low-carbon transition plans.    •  The final guidance should not suggest that banks mitigate credit risk by establishing and  managing to prescriptive lending limits.     We support the OCC’s recognition of the distinction between climate scenario analysis and  regulatory stress testing.     We urge the OCC to coordinate with domestic regulators and international bodies to ensure  consistent supervisory expectations with respect to climate-related financial risk management.  II.  The principles-based nature of the Proposal appropriately reflects the diversity of climate- related financial risks to which banks may be exposed and the need for flexibility in the design  and implementation of risk management approaches in this area.    We strongly support the principles-based nature of the Proposal, which appropriately reflects  that climate-related financial risks may vary significantly across banks and that there is likely to be  considerable diversity in the specific risk management tools and approaches that individual banks  deploy, particularly as efforts to identify and measure climate-related financial risks remain relatively  nascent.  We also support the Proposal’s acknowledgement that climate-related financial risk  management processes may be developed and implemented within a bank’s existing risk management  framework.      We encourage the OCC to retain this overall approach in the final guidance, and to avoid the  types of prescriptive or detailed mandates that are likely to hinder banks’ abilities to explore, test,  refine, and adapt how they manage climate-related financial risks over both the short- and long-term.   For example, it is important that banks have sufficient flexibility to develop and adapt their internal risk  taxonomies, to make decisions about how to incorporate climate-related financial risks organizationally  within their existing risk management framework, and to determine the relative materiality of climate-
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -4-  February 14, 2022      related financial risk exposures to the bank’s financial condition.  To that end, our comments identify a  number of specific areas where maintaining this principles-based approach is particularly important to  provide banks with appropriate flexibility.  A.  The Proposal should reflect that that there is significant variability of potential  climate-related financial risk outcomes over longer time horizons.    First, the Proposal’s Governance section notes that relevant time horizons may include those  that extend beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning horizon.  While this attention to longer-term  time horizons is relevant in the context of climate change, it is important that the final guidance  acknowledge that there is significant variability and uncertainty of potential outcomes over longer time  horizons.  As a result, any expectation that the board of directors develop an understanding of future  impacts should take account of this variability and uncertainty.        Second, the Proposal’s Strategic Planning section notes that the board of directors and  management should address the potential impact of climate-related financial risk exposures on the bank  over various time horizons.  Relatedly, the Proposal’s Other Nonfinancial Risk section states that bank  boards of directors and management should monitor how the execution of strategic decisions and the  operating environment affect the bank’s financial condition and operational resilience over time.  The  OCC’s expectations relating to longer-term strategic planning should allow for appropriate, risk-based  flexibility to account for the significant variability of outcomes over multi-decade time periods.  There is  significant complexity and unpredictability over these longer time horizons due to, among other things,  the high number of scientific, macroeconomic, financial, and other variables that can vary and must be  taken into account when assessing climate-related financial risk.  The OCC’s supervisory expectations  should be calibrated to the usefulness of strategic planning over a given time period and recognize that  substantial uncertainty exists with respect to the impacts of climate-related financial risk over medium-  and longer-term time horizons.  In addition, while a longer strategic planning horizon may be  appropriate in the context of climate-related financial risk, it is important that such expectations not be  carried over to other strategic planning exercises and processes, particularly those relating to capital and  liquidity, for which typical planning horizons have been and remain effective.      Third, the Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section notes that an effective scenario analysis  framework can assist banks in evaluating the resiliency of their strategy and risk management to the  structural changes arising from climate-related financial risks.  Given the significant variability of  outcomes over longer time horizons, supervisory expectations with respect to longer-term scenario  analyses should allow for appropriate flexibility in approaches to developing and leveraging these  analyses.  Similarly, it would be useful for the OCC to acknowledge that relatively more resources and  effort may be applied to shorter-term scenario analysis—where plausibility and degree of certainty is  higher and therefore potentially more relevant for risk and business decision-making—and less to  longer-term scenario analysis. 
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -5-  February 14, 2022      B.  The Proposal’s Policies, Procedures, and Limits section should retain its flexible  approach and acknowledge it would be premature at this time to require banks to  establish and apply quantitative limits or thresholds for climate-related financial risk.    The Proposal would establish an expectation that bank management incorporate climate- related financial risks into policies, procedures, and limits to provide detailed guidance on the bank’s  approach to these risks, in line with the strategy and risk appetite set by the board of directors.  While  this portion of the Proposal does not prescribe how banks should organize and implement these  policies, procedures, and limits, any final guidance should be clear that the use of quantitative limits and  thresholds for climate-related financial risk as a risk management tool is likely to be premature for many  banks at this time.4  Rather, banks should be permitted to initially use their directional analysis to  develop and inform their risk appetite and risk management frameworks prior to assessing whether any  limits and thresholds would be appropriate.5      C.  The Proposal’s Governance and Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting sections  should permit appropriate flexibility in the design of reporting.    The Proposal states that management is responsible for regularly reporting to the board of  directors on the level and nature of risks to the bank, including climate-related financial risks, and that  effective risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities allow management to capture and report  material and emerging climate-related financial risk exposures, segmented or stratified by physical and  transition risks, based upon the complexity and types of exposures.  This description could be  interpreted to suggest that climate-related financial risk should be reported on as a stand-alone  category of risk.      Climate risk is a transversal risk that may manifest in any one or more of the risk types that  banks have traditionally managed on a dedicated basis, such as credit, liquidity, operational, and legal  risk.  Final principles on governance and reporting therefore should be flexible and recognize that  climate-driven risks may be incorporated into and addressed through a bank’s existing risk management  governance program—which may, for example, be designed around the risk types referenced in the  OCC’s Heightened Standards—if the bank determines that this is the most effective means of risk  management.  The final guidance should make clear that it does not introduce a supervisory expectation  that banks create new, bespoke governance structures and reporting regimes for climate-related  financial risk as a standalone matter, as this would limit banks’ flexibility to integrate climate-related  financial risk into existing risk management approaches and would effectively create a new risk type.    4     In addition, as discussed in section V.A below, requiring lending limits would not be appropriate at this  time, as some banks already consider climate-related financial risks, particularly physical risks, in their  credit underwriting processes as appropriate, and such limits could have unintended consequences on  bank lending and access to credit.    5   This recognition is particularly important because banks may be developing their respective approaches  to climate-related financial risk management in a phased manner with multiple dependencies.  For  example, banks may have established different prioritizations and timelines for data collection and  standardization or scenario analysis.   
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -6-  February 14, 2022          In response to the Proposal’s Question 11, we also do not believe that a new type of regulatory  or other external reporting specifically directed at climate-related financial risk by banks is appropriate  or necessary at this point in time.  Many banks are already engaged in voluntary reporting efforts  through the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as well as other industry-led  reporting frameworks.    III.  The final guidance should clearly acknowledge that banks’ approach to managing climate- related financial risk should be fundamentally risk-based, such that individual banks may  tailor their risk management programs to the risks presented and calibrate that program to  the risks identified.    As an important complement to a principles-based approach, the OCC’s final guidance should  recognize that each bank has the discretion to develop climate-related financial risk management in a  risk-based manner that is consistent with the concept of proportionality.  This not only means that  supervisory expectations should be tailored to the circumstances of each institution—including with  respect to its size, business model, and client portfolio—but also that banks should develop and deploy  various capabilities to the extent proportionate with the risk management utility and effectiveness of  those capabilities, which may vary considerably.  For example, supervisory expectations with respect to  the scope and extent of data or scenario analysis capabilities should reflect the utility of those  capabilities as a risk management matter, which is likely to evolve considerably over time.  The final  guidance should clearly accommodate these kinds of risk-based approaches, as described further below.  A.  The Proposal’s Risk Management section should clarify that for purposes of risk  management, individual banks will need to define “materiality” in the context of their  individual circumstances and risk appetite framework.    The Proposal states that banks should employ a comprehensive process to identify emerging  and material risks stemming from their business activities and associated exposures.  We suggest that  the OCC clarify that the meaning of “material” for purposes of risk management is distinct from  materiality in the context of securities laws and it is for the individual bank to determine what is  material in the context of its risk appetite and framework.  For example, some important components of  how banks may assess materiality for risk management could be the plausibility and certainty of risk  (i.e., there will be potential risks that will be so speculative or distant as not to be material).  This may be  important for the OCC to recognize, as in practice supervisors may insist on deeming remote and  uncertain outcomes driven by climate change as “material” in ways they would not for more traditional  outcomes.6    6   It will also be important for the OCC to recognize that banks may not be in a position to evaluate the  plausibility and certainty of the risk—and therefore make materiality determinations—at this time due to  underlying data challenges.  Relevant data must first be generated, translated, validated, analyzed, and  weighted before materiality can be determined.  As discussed in section IV.A below, banks generally are in  the early stages of this process. 
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -7-  February 14, 2022      B.  The Proposal’s Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting section should acknowledge  that an appropriate, risk-based approach may lead individual institutions to focus on  different aspects of their portfolios.    The final guidance should recognize that it may be appropriate for banks, given their individual  circumstances, to focus initially on developing data capabilities and reporting on sectors, components of  certain value chains, or other parts of their portfolios that they deem may be more subject to climate- related financial risks (e.g., portfolios subject to heightened physical risks or higher emissions sectors  subject to heightened transition risks).7  Conversely, the final guidance should permit banks to  determine that certain sectors or types of climate-related financial risks represent sufficiently de  minimis risk that related reporting may not be useful or necessary.  C.  The Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section should acknowledge that banks have the  flexibility to conduct scenario analyses at appropriate, risk-based intervals.    The Proposal notes that management should develop and implement climate-related scenario  analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s size, complexity, business activity, and  risk profile.  Consistent with this guidance, banks should have the discretion to conduct scenario analysis  at intervals that are appropriate to their size, business activity, and other factors, as appropriate.  IV.  The final guidance and its underlying expectations should reflect the fact that data and tools  to measure and quantify climate-related financial risk remain nascent and not fully developed.    The OCC’s final guidance should reflect the evolving nature and understanding of climate- related financial risks and the fact that existing data and tools to measure and quantify climate-related  financial risk—and in particular, longer-term physical and transition risks—are only just emerging, and  will need to undergo substantial exploration, refinement, and adaptation over time.  Although data  capabilities are improving, significant gaps in data sourcing, capture, standardization, and aggregation  substantially affect the accuracy of projections and risk assessment.8  Given these challenges, the OCC  should give banks due flexibility to develop, adopt, implement, and refine both (i) data capabilities and  methodologies and (ii) quantitative risk management tools that depend on that data, such as risk limits,  risk appetites, or scenario analysis.  For this same reason, we also believe that it is important that any  final guidance acknowledge and affirm that, in many cases, banks may need to rely on qualitative  assessments and judgments about climate-related financial risks, particularly in the near-term while  more sophisticated and standardized data and measurement tools are being developed.    7   The banking sector, private sector generally, and regulatory agencies are developing data capabilities as  well, and the ability of individual banks to develop data capabilities in many ways depends on these larger  efforts.  8   Climate-related data provided by borrowers and counterparties is often limited and not consistent or  comparable.  For example, while property, asset, and supply chain data are available for larger public  clients, there are gaps when assessing smaller and privately-held clients or those in less carbon-intensive  sectors.  Further, and importantly, we note that emissions data may not necessarily be indicative of risk. 
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -8-  February 14, 2022      A.  The Proposal should acknowledge that, in the near-term, climate-related financial risk  metrics and reporting may be more qualitative in nature.    Data gaps currently prevent banks from being able to develop the kind of precise metrics that  are conducive to developing quantitative thresholds, limits, and KPIs and KRIs to generate, analyze, and  validate the kind of data needed to support those metrics.  Accordingly, it is important for the final  guidance to recognize that policies, procedures, and any limits as they relate to climate-related financial  risk, as well as reporting, initially may be more qualitative in nature and may rely less on standardized  metrics, limits, and thresholds.  The final guidance should acknowledge that the development of a  comprehensive risk identification process based on quantitative metrics may appropriately pass through  an extended transition state that is short of the mature approach identified in the Proposal and may be  useful only for limited purposes in the short-term.  B.  The Proposal’s Strategic Planning, Risk Management, and Other Nonfinancial Risk  sections should reflect the nascent state of relevant data.    Given data gaps and the evolution of climate and risk transmission models, banks are generally  in the data collection and risk identification and measurement stage and therefore it will be premature  in many instances to integrate climate-related financial risk into medium- and longer-term strategic  planning.9  For example, an expectation that banks further incorporate climate-related financial risk into  their capital and liquidity planning processes at this time would be inappropriate in light of the need for  further maturation of the relevant quantitative tools.10  As the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  recently determined, there is limited research and accompanying data that explore how climate-related  financial risks feed into the traditional risks faced by banks.11  The final guidance should establish an  expectation that banks integrate climate-related financial risk into strategic planning only to the extent  that the underlying data and methodologies are sufficiently developed and tested, and further should  acknowledge that banks may employ qualitative approaches in the near-term while data and  methodologies remain under development.    9   We also note that the integration of climate-related financial risk management into strategic planning is  distinct from the integration of public commitments with respect to emissions or other environmental  goals into strategic planning.   10   Moreover, to the extent that banks are expected to incorporate climate-related financial risk into their  capital planning process, it is critical that the capital planning framework maintains its existing  parameters, especially as relates to time horizon, plausibility, and expected and unexpected losses.  Banks  already incorporate short-term, evolving physical risk into capital planning, as is appropriate given the  purpose and goals of capital planning.  11   Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels  (April 2021), https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf.   
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -9-  February 14, 2022      C.  The Proposal’s Scenario Analysis section should reflect the relative immaturity of  underlying data and methodologies.    Banks are actively engaged in developing scenario analysis capabilities,12 and any final guidance  should recognize the exploratory nature of scenario analysis given the data gaps and the fact that  models and methodologies are evolving.  For example, even the internationally established reference  scenarios have developed granularity only for a subset of sectors.  The final guidance should permit  banks to leverage the results of scenario analysis in a manner commensurate with the maturity of the  underlying data and methodologies.  Further, given that this work is in the early stages, banks should  have sufficient flexibility to develop and implement scenario analysis and related data capabilities over  time.  D.  It would be helpful to banks if the OCC could provide initial comparative risk data  among peer institutions.    The OCC has requested feedback on what challenges banks face in incorporating the risk  management principles articulated in the Proposal into their risk management systems, and how the  OCC should further engage with banks to understand those challenges.  One challenge in incorporating  these risk management principles is that banks lack comparative data across peer institutions with  respect to risk measures.  This challenge exists because, unlike quantitative metrics for other risk pillars,  for which there are generally known metrics based on accepted associated data, there is a lack of  standardized and accepted climate risk metrics.  It also exists because there are diverse sources of data  that are available to banks for risk management and reporting, which makes it difficult to compare risk  management and reporting practices across banks in a consistent manner.  Until these risk measures are  accessible and standardized, it would be helpful to banks if the OCC’s Supervision System and Analytical  Support group could provide initial comparative data among peer institutions.  V.  The final guidance should acknowledge that it may be appropriate and beneficial for banks to  support customers through their respective low-carbon transition plans.    It is crucial that the final guidance acknowledge and affirm that it is appropriate—and indeed, in  many cases desirable—for banks to support and serve customer needs over the course of any climate- driven economic transition.  This recognition is not only important to ensuring an effective and orderly  transition to a carbon-neutral economy, but it is also to be encouraged as a matter of safety and  soundness, as giving banks the flexibility to support customers through that transition is likely to  produce better outcomes for the bank in both the short- and long-run.  This recognition also is  consistent with previous remarks by the OCC about the potential consequences for customers when  banks terminate these relationships.13    12   For example, many banks are onboarding sophisticated acute physical risk models to quantify asset and  exposure impacts under more severe physical risk scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5).    13   Remarks by Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J. Curry, Institute of International Bankers (March 7,  2016), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/speeches/2016/pub-speech-2016-25.pdf (stating that,   
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -10-  February 14, 2022      A.  The final guidance should not suggest that banks mitigate credit risk by establishing  and managing to prescriptive lending limits.    The Proposal states that the board of directors and management should consider climate- related financial risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios and that bank  management should determine credit risk appetite and lending limits related to these risks.  Some banks  already consider climate-related financial risks, particularly physical risks such as flooding, fire, and other  severe weather-related risks, in their credit underwriting processes as appropriate, and banks are  continuing to explore the impact of physical and transition risks on credit decisions as analytical  approaches evolve and the climate data environment expands.  It should also be noted that banks may  already impose limits or certain thresholds for industrial or geographic sectors based on a variety of risk  factors and it is not clear that any climate-related risk for such sectors would in any way alter or replace  existing risk limits or thresholds; significantly more analysis is needed to make such assessments.        As described above, however, the final guidance should clarify that the OCC does not expect  banks to mitigate credit risk by establishing and managing to prescriptive limits on lending to certain  sectors or otherwise.  Such an expectation could have unintended consequences on bank lending and  access to credit.  The final guidance should recognize that banks are supporting these clients’ transition  to a low-carbon economy across a necessarily long-term horizon, and managing any climate-related  financial risks of doing so within the construct of their internal risk appetite and management  frameworks.  It also would be helpful if the final guidance recognized that the integration of climate- related financial risk into the credit granting and monitoring process is nascent and will improve as  climate-related financial risk measurement techniques mature.  B.  We believe that banks have an important role to play in addressing the impact of  climate-related financial risks on LMI communities.    The Proposal states that the board of directors and management should consider climate- related financial risk impacts on, among other things, low- and moderate-income (“LMI”) and other  disadvantaged households and communities.  We agree with the Proposal’s statement that climate  change could have a potentially disproportionate impact on the financially vulnerable and believe that  banks have an important role to play in supporting LMI communities in response to increased climate  risks.        We also believe that partnership with the government is crucial to this effort.  We recommend  that regulators work with the industry to analyze impacts on LMI communities and how they can be best  addressed in accordance with the existing banking laws and regulations.  For example, through their  rulemaking to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act, the agencies should consider how activities    “[D]ecisions to terminate relationships can have regrettable consequences.  Longstanding business  relationships may be disrupted. . . . Customers whose banking relationships are terminated and who  cannot make alternate banking arrangements elsewhere may effectively be cut off from the regulated  financial system altogether.”). 
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -11-  February 14, 2022      to improve the climate resilience of LMI communities receive CRA credit.  For example, the agencies  should clearly articulate which types of activities, for both individual properties and large-scale  community projects, would be eligible for CRA credit.  Further, given the importance of housing to CRA  plans and the complexity of risk pricing and insurance impacts that may affect long-term value and  wealth preservation in impacted communities, it is essential for the agencies to consult and coordinate  with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ensure transition externalities are addressed in a manner that  balances safety, soundness, and fairness.  Policy responses to the issue of climate-related financial risk  could also be advanced through coordination with the federal housing agencies and government- sponsored enterprises to improve other relevant federal programs, such as flood insurance.  VI.  We support the OCC’s recognition of the distinction between climate scenario analysis and  regulatory stress testing.    The Proposal notes that climate scenario analysis exercises differ from traditional regulatory  stress testing exercises, which typically assess the potential impacts of transitory shocks to near-term  economic and financial conditions.  We strongly support the OCC’s recognition of this distinction.14        As background, banks are investing in talent, data, and technology to build robust climate  scenario modelling and analytical capabilities across all lines of business and risk types and running  exercises across different parts of their portfolios to assess a range of plausible climate change  outcomes.  Scenario analysis frameworks are generally based on selecting discrete points along a  spectrum of potential future global temperatures—leveraging output from organizations such as the  International Energy Agency (“IEA”), Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), and  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (“IPCC”)—which represent baseline, strategic, and stress  scenarios.  Publicly-available climate scenarios do not provide banks with the appropriate sectoral and  regional granularity, however, to directly translate scenario output into readily consumable inputs for  internal risk modeling.  For banks, the value of climate scenario analysis can only be fully realized when  the science-based or macroeconomic output (e.g., global oil price or oil demand from the transportation  sector) is expanded into more granular financial impacts (e.g., electric vehicle vs. internal combustion  engine sales volume or lithium demand from elective vehicle battery producers) that can be applied  across a diverse set of client industries and sub-sectors.  There is also a limited understanding of the  Integrated Assessment Models that drive these scenarios, which makes it more challenging for banks  and vendors alike to expand scenario output while staying within the bounds of the model.      The OCC has requested feedback on what factors are most salient for the OCC to consider when  designing and executing scenario analysis exercises.  Given the significant work that is already underway  within banks, as described above, and the extensive work that has already taken place through the IEA,    14   The FSOC report on climate-related financial risk likewise distinguished scenario analysis from stress  testing, noting that the former is “exploratory in nature” while the latter is linked to regulatory  requirements such as loss-absorbing capital.  FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21,  2021), 90, https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf.  
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -12-  February 14, 2022      NGFS, and IPCC, we would recommend the OCC not develop its own bespoke scenarios for banks to use  in scenario analysis at this point in time.  It may be helpful, however, for the OCC to provide guidance as  to which of these or other external scenarios might be useful for banks to use as they build out their  capabilities, and for the OCC to affirm that banks have the flexibility to make appropriate judgments on  the implementation of these scenarios.  It will also be important that the OCC coordinates with the  Federal Reserve on any efforts being undertaken to develop climate scenarios and modelling  capabilities.  Notably, it is important that any expectations with regard to specific scenarios for  integration into risk management frameworks focus on severe but plausible scenarios and not  exaggerated scenarios that unrealistically frontload physical and transition risks.    VII.  We urge the OCC to coordinate with domestic regulators and international bodies to ensure  consistent supervisory expectations with respect to climate-related financial risk  management.    BPI urges the OCC to coordinate closely with its peer U.S. banking agencies (i.e., the FDIC and  Federal Reserve), the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and other  international regulatory colleagues to help ensure that supervisory expectations for the management of  climate-related financial risk, including with respect to scenario analysis, are consistent within the U.S.  and coordinated internationally.15  Such consistency and coordination will be crucial to avoid the  potential for duplicative or conflicting requirements imposed on banks, which would not only be  burdensome, but would also likely undermine rather than support banks’ abilities to manage climate- related financial risk.  Simply put, it will be untenable and counterproductive for larger banking  organizations to be expected to manage climate-related financial risk one way at the depository  institution level and another at the holding company level, or one way in the United States and another  abroad.  Successful management of climate-related financial risk is a global, enterprise-wide endeavor.16   Furthermore, we recommend any future guidance developed through the interagency process or at the  international level be subject to robust public comment given that banks are at the forefront of some of  the technological developments that are occurring in relation to climate-related risk tools and  analytics.17    15   We support the OCC’s stated objective of establishing climate-related financial risk expectations  applicable to all OCC-supervised banks, because climate-related financial risk impacts all banks, regardless  of size.  16   As a global concern and as discussed in section VIII.A below, the final guidance should permit enterprise- wide climate-related financial risk management approaches to be established at the parent company  level.  This would have the benefit of accounting for the different structures of foreign banking  organizations operating in the U.S. and allow for flexibility and tailoring in the application of the guidance.  17   Given that the management of climate-related financial risk is an evolving practice, we believe it would be  appropriate for the OCC to update the final guidance as appropriate. 
Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -13-  February 14, 2022      VIII.  Other Comments on the Proposal  A.  The Proposal’s Governance section should affirm that the board of director’s role in  climate-related financial risk management is effective oversight of senior  management’s implementation of risk management.    The Proposal notes that effective risk governance is essential to the safe and sound  management of exposure to climate risk and outlines key responsibilities of the board of directors and  management with respect to climate risk, and indicates that the OCC intends to issue subsequent  guidance to further distinguish roles and responsibilities of the board of directors and management.  It is  important that any such final guidance follow clear and longstanding legal and safety and soundness  principles that clearly distinguish the roles and responsibilities of the board of directors and senior  management, respectively, and not conflate the two.  As discussed in a recent industry report issued by  the Bank Policy Institute18 and consistent with the OCC’s Heightened Standards, a central tenet of  effective corporate governance is the distinction between, and complementary nature of, the board of  director’s responsibility for oversight of the business and affairs of the bank, and management’s  responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the organization.  Any blurring of this distinction would  detract from effective governance by potentially reducing the board of director’s ability to perform its  oversight role objectively and creating uncertainty as to roles and responsibilities.        While the approaches taken by individual boards of directors will appropriately vary, we note  the following relating to the core role of boards of directors and board committees:  (i) directors should  ask informed, probing questions of management, including with respect to the resources being  dedicated to climate-related financial risk management;19 (ii) reporting to the board of directors by  senior leaders with responsibility for climate-related financial risk oversight should generally relate to  material risks, developments, policies, and/or other issues, consistent with the board of director’s role in  guiding the strategic direction of the organization and providing effective and objective oversight of  management’s performance; and (iii) the performance of core board of directors functions, such as  oversight of risk management and control frameworks, at the various levels of the banking organization  may be coordinated at the top-tier parent holding company level, taking into account the independent  legal and governance responsibilities of subsidiary boards.  In view of the foregoing, flexibility should be  maintained to permit delegation to management on such matters as (i) organization of internal climate- related roles, responsibilities, and governance structures and/or (ii) review of any public statements to  ensure consistency with internal strategies and risk appetites.      18   See generally, Bank Policy Institute, Guiding Principles for Enhancing U.S. Banking Organization Corporate  Governance (Jan. 12, 2021 Exposure Draft Edition), https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BPI- Guiding-Principles-on-Enhancing-Banking-Organization-Corporate-Governance.pdf.

Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency  -14- February 14, 2022  B. The Proposal’s Strategic Planning section should establish realistic expectations with respect to public statements. The Proposal states that, where banks engage in public communication of their climate-related  strategies, the board of directors and management should ensure that any such statements are  consistent with internal strategies and risk appetite statements.  The final guidance with respect to  public communications should recognize the aspirational nature of external commitments and the fact  that these commitments and plans will need to adapt over time as data and methodologies improve and  external circumstances change.  In addition, the final guidance should recognize that banks are already  subject to a variety of securities and consumer protection laws and regulations that regulate the manner  in which they disclose information and market their products, and that banks are actively engaged with  the authorities enforcing these laws and regulations to ensure their public statements meet applicable  requirements.  Therefore, the OCC should calibrate its expectations as to the granularity between  external statements and internal risk appetite statements accordingly.  * * * * * Bank Policy Institute appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposal.

Respectfully submitted,  Lauren Anderson  Senior Vice President, Associate General Counsel  Bank Policy Institute","The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) supports the FDIC's draft Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for large financial institutions, which aims to help these institutions manage climate-related risks. BPI appreciates the alignment of the FDIC's proposal with the OCC's similar proposal, emphasizing the need for consistency to avoid conflicting requirements. However, BPI expresses concern over the FDIC's suggestion that financial institutions should manage climate risks in a way that mitigates broader economic impacts, arguing this expectation is novel and lacks legal basis. BPI urges the FDIC to clarify this point and consult with other agencies. Additionally, BPI supports considering climate resilience activities for disadvantaged communities under the Community Reinvestment Act. The comment also highlights the importance of flexibility in risk management approaches, given the nascent state of data and tools for measuring climate-related risks.

Sheesley  Ji l PEOPLESTRUST  BANK  Assistant Execut ive Secretary  Attention: Comments-RIN (3064-ZA32)  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429  Re: Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (RIN (3064- ZA32))  Dear Mr. Sheesley:  My name is Randy Whitehead, President and CEO of PeoplesTrust Bank in Hamilton, Alabama. I am  writing to provide comments regarding the FDIC's statement of principles for climate-related financial  risk management for large financial institutions. I suspect that should these proposed requirements be  placed upon larger institutions it will only be a matter of time before smaller institutions will have  similar requirements.  I submit to you that the risk of ever-increasing regulation and the related expense, creates a much  greater risk to ru ral community banks than does climate change risk. As you know the tremendous  expense involved in complying with this regulation would be a huge burden on small community banks.  The banks which are the financial lifeblood of rural towns and communities are either being  consolidated into larger institutions or are closing branches in small towns partially due to the ever- increasing cost of regulation, leaving the people of these communities with the only option of driving  many miles to participate in the banking system .  Our small City of Hamilton, Alabama has a branch of a major nationwide banking institution. While that  institution is pleased to operate here and offer a myriad of checking accounts which provide that  institution with low-cost deposits to be utilized around the country, local individuals and small  businesses find it difficult to obtain loans at that institution. My point, obviously, is that without small,  local community banks, people in rural communities are going to be greatly harmed and unable to  participate in the financial system.  1281 Military Street South • P.O.

Climate change is ultimately ""weather"" which fluctuates and cycles over time within a fairly narrow  range. As high school students in the 1970's we observed that the climate scientists of the time were  predicting that t he earth was entering into the next ""ice age"". How wise would it have been to commit  millions and billions of dollars over the course of the past 50 years preparing for the risk associated with  another ice age?  We operate a branch in Hackleburg, Alabama, a small town that was almost totally destroyed in the  tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011. We were able to work with our customers in the aftermath of that  disaster and in t he years since the tornado the town has become better and stronger. Having witnessed  the devastation personally, I can attest that no amount of risk management would have reduced the  damage done by the F-5 tornado that day. In addition, many of our customers, operated heavy  equipment (fueled by diesel and gasoline) to clear the debris from the destruction and help residents  get on with their lives.  While I am pleased that this proposal is currently limited to banks of $100 billion or more in total assets,  I also know that many times, limited application regulations are ultimately applied to all banking  institutions.

Whitehead emphasizes that the cost of compliance could threaten the viability of rural community banks, which are crucial for local economies. He highlights the challenges faced by small towns like Hamilton, Alabama, where large banks do not adequately serve local lending needs. Whitehead questions the necessity of climate risk management, citing historical climate predictions that did not materialize, and argues that natural disasters, like the 2011 tornado in Hackleburg, Alabama, cannot be mitigated through risk management. He urges the FDIC to reconsider implementing these requirements, fearing they could harm rural communities financially."

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC  20429      Subject:   Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions (RIN 3064-ZA32)      Dear Mr. Sheesley and FDIC Board of Directors:    Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the FDIC’s statement of  principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I  am a Board Member and Executive Vice President of Jonah Bank of Wyoming.  Jonah  Bank of Wyoming is a $500 million community bank located in Casper and Cheyenne,  Wyoming.  We are a full-service financial institution and are well-positioned to meet the  financial service needs of our community.      Jonah Bank of Wyoming is also the only community bank in the region that focuses on  providing credit to small oil and gas producers.  With respect to our direct energy  portfolio, we have extended credit secured by production and mineral interests in  Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and  Nevada.  While this is a highly technical and specialized type of lending, our board  members and energy lenders have in excess of 100 years of combined experience in  providing credit to this industry.  Our direct energy portfolio represents approximately  10% of our overall commercial loan outstandings and 45% of tier-one capital.    Application of the Principles to Large and Small Banks    The Board of Directors and management of Jonah Bank of Wyoming have significant  concerns related to the proposed principles.  While we recognize the principles are  designed for financial institutions with assets in excess of $100 billion; invariably the  principles will trickle down to all banks.  I personally have observed this reality having  served as a state bank examiner and Deputy Banking Commissioner for over a decade.   Our community bank has experienced a large increase in oil and gas industry loan 
requests due to the social governance policies of larger institutions.  Should the FDIC  implement these new risk management principles, this industry will be driven even  further into the community bank space.  As this occurs, the risk concerns expressed for  large institutions will be shifted to smaller institutions.  Those who support these  additional risk management principles will turn their sites in our direction and request  expansion of the regulatory oversight.            Regardless of the size of the bank for which the princples are designed to apply, the mere  existence of such principles will result in yet another headwind to the oil and gas  industry.  The oil and gas industry is vital to the economic success and overall standard of  living in our country.  We are already experiencing the negative impact of the  implementation of unreasonable barriers (originating from different agencies in  Washington, DC) to the development of oil and gas resources.  As a result, the  development of new supplies of oil and gas are not keeping up with demand, and prices  have soared for these vital commodities.  The escalation in utility bills and the cost to  purchase fuel is negatively impacting household disposable income and  disproportionately impacts the quality of life for low and moderate income households.   There is no doubt the overall regulatory environment is the significant factor impacting  the development of new supplies of oil and gas.  Furthermore, uncertainty in the markets  caused by burdensome regulation and barriers to the maintenance of current production  levels is negatively impacting oil and gas employment.  This affects small communities  to a much larger degree than metropolitan areas, due to the vast majority of oil and gas  production being located in rural areas.  The proposed principles for climate-related  financial risk management will add to the problem and reduce the credit available to the  oil and gas industry, further exacerbating the issues that are already evident in our local,  state, and national economy.    Risk Management Practices    The principles are not specifically aimed at managing bank exposure to the oil and gas  industry.  While it will have a direct impact on the oil and gas industry, the proposed  framework is designed to require the implementation of a set of practices to manage  climate change risk more broadly.  This is unnecessary and will be burdensome.  Banks  have been managing risk for decades.  Existing risk management practices at community  banks are effective.  Community bankers know their customers and have been successful  in working with their customers to manage through droughts, natural disasters,  and  changes to industries that become obsolete.  None of this is new and community banks  have always managed these risks.  While it might be trendy to state that climate change is  new and different, it is not.  Compliance with a new climate-related  risk framework will  be expensive, duplicative of existing risk management practices, and unnecessary.      In addition to the proposed general risk management framework, the component of  scenario analysis should not become mandatory for a non-complex, low risk profile  community bank.  This analysis would be complex, expensive, and based on speculation.   Community banks are already well-positioned to manage economic shocks in our  communities and adding a scenario analysis component, especially related to climate risk,  would provide no value to our Board of Directors and management in the preservation of  our risk profile. 
  Conclusion    Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the proposed principles for  climate-related financial risk management.  In conclusion, we offer the following  recommendations:    • While the proposed principles are designed to apply to large banks, the existence  of such principles will impact the oil and gas industry and availability of credit to  that industry.  We recommend that the FDIC rely on existing risk management  frameworks that are proven effective, rather than implementing another broad and  speculative layer of additional burdensome requirements.  That said, should the  FDIC implement these principles for large banks, we recommend that the FDIC  ensure that the principles do not trickle down to smaller banks.  Adding additional  burden to small banks will result in further consolidation in the industry and the  loss of critical financial infrastructure for the extension of credit to small  businesses.  •  The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), in conjunction with the  regulatory agencies, should conduct a series of outreach meetings with community  bankers prior to instituting any supervisory guidance on climate risks. To ensure  that the community bank perspective is appropriately represented and that climate- risk regulation does not unfairly penalize or overburden community banks, we  recommend that FSOC include an individual with community banking experience  on its new Climate-Related Financial Risk Advisory Committee (CFRAC).  • Jonah Bank of Wyoming supports providing incentives to industries deemed to be  affected by climate change if such incentives reward current and future practices.  Such incentives could include carbon sequestration or other climate change  mitigation efforts that support the long-term use of oil and gas, which is the  cheapest, most abundant, and most reliable source of energy available.

Williams, Executive Vice President of Jonah Bank of Wyoming, expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management principles for large financial institutions. He argues that although these principles target large banks, they will inevitably affect smaller community banks like Jonah Bank, which provides credit to small oil and gas producers. Williams contends that the principles will shift risk management burdens to smaller banks, potentially reducing credit availability to the oil and gas industry, which is crucial for economic stability. He criticizes the proposed framework as unnecessary and duplicative, emphasizing that community banks already manage risks effectively. Williams recommends relying on existing risk management frameworks and suggests that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) engage with community bankers before implementing new regulations. He also advocates for incentives to support climate change mitigation efforts in the oil and gas industry. Overall, Williams warns against the trickle-down effect of these principles on smaller banks and the potential negative impact on the oil and gas sector and local economies."

The FDIC has rightly recognized that the “effects of climate  change and the transition to a low carbon economy present emerging economic and  financial risks that threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the  stability of the financial system,” and that “[w]eaknesses in how institutions identify,  measure, monitor, and control the physical and transition risks associated with a changing  climate could adversely affect a financial institution’s safety and soundness, as well as the  overall financial system.”2  Additionally, we are pleased to see the FDIC make clear that its focus on climate- related financial risks is about safety and soundness concerns. The FDIC articulates the  position that “climate-related financial risks have the potential to impact financial  institutions and the economy through both macroeconomic and microeconomic factors.”3  We agree with this assessment and appreciate the explicit focus on safety and soundness  as it permits the FDIC to use the full range of its regulatory and supervisory authorities to  ensure that banks, thrifts, and other FDIC-supervised institutions (collectively, “banks”)  take action to protect their operations and balance sheets. The FDIC also appropriately  notes that “interconnections within the financial system can accelerate the spread of a  climate related financial shocks, leading to potential contagion effects if institutions    1 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions,” Federal Register 87 (64) (2022): 19507-19512, available at  https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/04/04/2022-07065/statement-of-principles-for-climate- related-financial-risk-management-for-large-financial?msclkid=47da1ec4b43711eca3d5d7211f084635.   2 Ibid, p. 19509.  3 Ibid, p. 19508.    
experience shocks as a result of physical or transition risks.”4 Again, we agree with this  assessment.  In addition to the above comments, below are answers to questions the RFI poses.  Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business  model, should inform financial institutions' adoption of these principles?  Although the FDIC limits its draft principles for climate-related financial risk  management to banks “with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets,” the principles  themselves are sufficiently high-level to apply to all banks, regardless of size, location, and  business model.5 For example, the FDIC explains that “[a] financial institution’s board and  management should demonstrate an appropriate understanding of climate-related  financial risk exposures and their impact on risk appetite to facilitate oversight,” as well as  that “[a] financial institution should employ a comprehensive process to identify emerging  and material risks stemming from the institution's business activities and associated  exposures.”6 The FDIC notes that “all financial institutions, regardless of size, may have  material exposures to climate-related financial risks,” and the principles articulated apply  just as much to an institution with $500 billion in assets as one with $50 billion, $5 billion,  or less.7    While the FDIC should apply the principles to all institutions, it should differentiate  in the implementation of these principles. Implementation will clearly differ based on  factors the FDIC listed (i.e., asset size, location, business model) and others.  Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its  climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size,  complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations?  It is imperative that the FDIC provide institutions with the guidance they need to  firmly understand and address their climate-related financial risks and explain how the  FDIC intends to incorporate these risks into its examinations.  a. The FDIC must explain how climate risks relate to traditional financial risks and help  banks understand how to manage their climate-related financial risks.  The FDIC must continue to use guidance to describe the physical and transition  risks associated with climate change and explain how those risks relate to traditional  financial risks with which institutions are familiar (e.g., credit risk, market risk, liquidity  risk, operational risk). As the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) recently noted,  although these risks “will manifest in forms familiar to financial institutions[,] … the  nature of climate risks is less familiar.”8 Accordingly, the FDIC must provide in guidance    4 Ibid, p. 19509, noting Financial Stability Board, The Implications of Climate Change for Financial Stability  (2020); Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels  (2021).  5 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions,” p. 19507.   6 Ibid, p. 19510.  7 Ibid, p. 19509.   8 Financial Stability Oversight Council, “Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk” (Washington: 2021), p. 24,  available at https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf.  
examples of each type of risk so bankers can truly understand the risks they face.9 For  example:  •  Credit risk: Institutions may see increased real estate losses due to hurricanes,  agricultural loan losses due to drought, losses from fossil fuel companies as  demand for greener products increases, or losses from borrowers in communities  where the economy is dependent on the fossil fuel industry.  •  Market risk: Institutions may see losses due to agricultural commodity price  increases due to crop damage or increased costs of capital if shareholders and  bondholders withdraw financing because of a bank’s climate-related risks.  •  Liquidity risk: Institutions may see lower liquidity as natural disasters losses  impair the value of long-term assets or disrupt short-term funding sources.  •  Operational risk: Institutions may cease operating for a period of time if they lose  power as a result of storms disabling the power grid.  •  Reputational risk: Institutions may face increased costs of capital if potential  shareholders and bondholders shift funding away from firms known to fund fossil  fuel producers.  The FDIC must also explain to institutions how many of these risks are  interconnected and that a bank may face multiple climate-related financial risks at once  from the same or different counterparties (e.g., institutions may face credit risk from  agricultural borrowers at the same time as they face market risk from increased  agricultural commodity prices). It must also stress that transition risk may come from  both governmental activities (e.g., new statutes or regulations) and from private actors  (e.g., shifts in investor preferences).  Further, the FDIC must use guidance to help banks understand how best to  manage their climate-related financial risks. Although the FDIC should not mandate  particular risk-reducing activities, it should help institutions understand options for  reducing, mitigating, or otherwise managing their climate-related risks. These options  could include, among others, incorporating climate-related financial risk management  practices in all business lines, creating procedures by which climate-related issues may be  escalated to the management or board level, and assisting counterparties in developing  their own climate-related risk management or transition plans.  To both highlight climate-related financial risks and help banks manage those  risks, the FDIC should use existing publications and activities such as the Quarterly  Banking Profile, periodic Risk Reviews, and the Community Banking Research Program to  understand, identify, and articulate the seriousness of its climate concerns.  b. The FDIC must provide guidance as to how climate-related financial risks fit into the  CAMELS framework.  The FDIC uses the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System, better known as  CAMELS, “for evaluating the soundness of financial institutions on a uniform basis and for    9 See generally Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund and others, “Recommendations for  Supervisory Guidance for Bank Regulators” September 2021, p. 5, available at  https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/supervision-guidance-climate-risk-202109.pdf.  
identifying those institutions requiring special supervisory attention or concern.”10 FDIC  examiners assign banks a score of 1 to 5 on six components (“capital adequacy, asset  quality, management capability, earnings quantity and quality, the adequacy of liquidity,  and sensitivity to market risk”) and provide an overall composite score. Banks take their  CAMELS ratings very seriously, and regulators use them to decide whether a bank holding  company can engage in non-banking financial activities and how much to charge for  insurance premiums.11  The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) has provided  guidance on what factors examiners should consider when evaluating banks for each  component, and climate risk may be easily incorporated.12 The FDIC should issue guidance  explaining how its examiners will incorporate climate-related financial risks into its  CAMELS ratings. For example, the FFIEC guidance explains that examiners should consider  “balance sheet composition, including the nature and amount of intangible assets, market  risk, concentration risk, and risks associated with nontraditional activities” when  determining a bank’s Capital Adequacy score.13 Accordingly, the FDIC could explain that  examiners may consider whether its assets are at risk of losing value as markets transition  away from fossil fuels. Similarly, the FFIEC guidance explains that examiners should  consider “the adequacy of, and conformance with, appropriate internal policies and  controls addressing the operations and risks of significant activities” to determine a bank’s  Management score, and examiners may consider whether the bank has sufficient policies  addressing climate-related financial risk.14  c. The FDIC must update its examination manuals to incorporate climate-related financial  risks.  The FDIC maintains several different examination manuals, including its Risk  Management Manual of Examination Policies,15 its Consumer Compliance Examination  Manual,16 and its Trust Examination Manual.17 Although these manuals are drafted to aid  examiners in evaluating banks’ safety and soundness, institutions themselves rely on  these manuals to understand the FDIC’s and examiners’ expectations of them. Accordingly,  the FDIC should update these manuals to ensure that climate-related financial risk is  referenced as appropriate and in a timely manner. Additionally, if the FDIC determines it is    10 Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, “Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System,” Federal  Register 61 (245) (1996): 67021-67029, available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1996-12- 19/pdf/96-32174.pdf.   11 See Legal Information Institute, “12 U.S. Code § 1843 - Interests in nonbanking organizations,” available at  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1843 (last accessed May 2022); Legal Information Institute,  “12 U.S. Code § 1841 - Definitions,” available at https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1841 (last  accessed May 2022); Legal Information Institute, “12 CFR § 327.16 - Assessment pricing methods,” available at  https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/327.16 (last accessed May 2022).  12 Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, “Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System.”   13 Ibid, p. 67026.  14 Ibid, p. 67027.  15 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Risk Management Manual of Examination Policies,” available at  https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/ (last accessed May 2022).   16 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Consumer Compliance Examination Manual,” available at  https://www.fdic.gov/resources/supervision-and-examinations/consumer-compliance-examination- manual/index.html (last accessed May 2022).    17 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Trust Examination Manual,” available at  https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/trustmanual/ (last accessed May 2022).  
necessary to employ examiners focused on climate-related financial risks, it should  consider issuing an exam manual dedicated to that topic.  d. The FDIC must tailor guidance.  As the FDIC articulates new climate related principles and expectations for how  institutions will implement those principles, it should consider (on a document-by- document basis) whether or how those principles or expectations may be tailored to  institutions’ business lines or sizes. The FDIC should also consider whether institutions  with particular business lines or institutions that operate in particular locations require  tailored guidance. For example, institutions with high concentrations of mortgage loans  will have different risk profiles from institutions with high concentrations of agricultural  loans, and institutions with high concentrations of mortgage loans in one area of the  country will have different risk profiles from institutions in others. The FDIC should tailor  its expectations for how institutions will mitigate their risks faced, and it would be  appropriate for the FDIC to issue guidance specifying what those tailored expectations are.  e. The FDIC must tailor examiners’ interactions with banks.  Just as the FDIC should tailor its written guidance, its examiners’ interactions with  institutions should be similarly tailored. Some of the largest institutions are keenly aware  of their climate risks and began taking steps to mitigate those risks even before the FDIC  issued its guidance.18 For these institutions, examiners’ climate-related responsibilities  should be focused on, for example, ensuring that institutions’ managements have put forth  policies and procedures based on the most recent science, and that staff comply with those  policies and procedures. However, for smaller institutions that may not have the resources  to begin adapting to the realities of climate change, examiners should have conversations  with institutions’ boards and management so that they understand their institutions face  climate-related risks and have basic information as to the range of possible responses.  f.  The FDIC must require that banks fulfill their public commitments.  We strongly support the FDIC’s statement that, “where institutions engage in  public communication of their climate-related strategies, boards and management should  ensure that any public statements about an institution’s climate related strategies and  commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements.”  Although the FDIC cannot legally mandate that institutions make specific public  commitments regarding their loan portfolios, it should require that when institutions  articulate measurable targets that they also take the steps necessary to adhere to those  targets.  When an institution fails to adhere to its public commitments on climate change, it  could face losses for both reputational and legal reasons. First, institutions that make  extensive climate commitments, such as commitments to be net zero by 2050, may lose  customers if they fail to make significant progress on those commitments, as individuals  who choose their banks based in part on climate pledges may move their business away    18 For example, six U.S.-headquartered global systemically important banks have joined the Net-Zero Banking  Alliance. See Net-Zero Banking Alliance, “Members,” available at https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero- banking/members/ (last accessed May 2022).  
from institutions that fail to make progress on their commitments. Second, publicly traded  institutions that make climate commitments may face litigation under the securities laws  for making materially false statements if they similarly fail to make significant progress on  those commitments. To help institutions avoid losses from these risks, the FDIC should  make clear that institutions that make public climate commitments must develop and  implement credible strategies for fulfilling those commitments.   Importantly, those strategies should not rely on carbon offsets, which are  “tradable ‘rights’ or certificates linked to activities that lower the amount of carbon  dioxide in the atmosphere.”19 Not only is there deep concern that many carbon offsets, as  currently designed, do not work,20 but regulators with jurisdiction over carbon markets  may bring enforcement actions against sellers of offsets for fraud, severely limiting the  supply and increasing the price of legitimate offsets.21 To the extent institutions wish to  rely on carbon offsets to meet their commitments, the FDIC should ensure that efforts are  in place to substantiate that those offsets result in the removal of carbon from the  atmosphere.  Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these  draft principles into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further  engage with financial institutions to understand those challenges?  In our interactions with banks, the primary challenge they face is with obtaining  data with which to effectively understand their climate-related financial risks.  Accordingly, the FDIC should provide guidance as to what types of information may be  useful in helping institutions understand their climate risks as well as how banks may  obtain this information.  In order to fully understand their counterparties’ and their own operations’  climate-related financial risks, banks will need asset-specific data and metrics that are  forward-looking. Banks will need information both from counterparties and from public  sources to fully understand their exposure to climate-related financial risks.  When making loans, banks typically rely on information disclosed by borrowers,  and banks should request climate-related information from their counterparties. The  Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed climate disclosure rule provides  good examples of the types of information that banks should be requesting from their  borrowers,22 including information about how corporate borrowers’ governance policies    19 See e.g., Angelo Gurgel, “Carbon Offsets,” MIT Climate Portal, September 11, 2020, available at  https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/carbon-offsets.  20 See e.g., Lisa Song and Paula Moura, “An Even More Inconvenient Truth: Why Carbon Credits for Forest  Preservation May Be Worse Than Nothing,” ProPublica, May 22, 2019, available at  https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work- deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia/.  21 Todd Phillips, “A Climate and Competition Agenda for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,”  American Progress, February 1, 2022, available at https://www.americanprogress.org/article/a-climate-and- competition-agenda-for-the-commodity-futures-trading-commission/ (“The CFTC has jurisdiction over carbon  offsets through its authority to address fraud and market manipulation in spot commodity markets…and it can  hold offset issuers accountable if they promise carbon reductions that do not, or simply cannot, occur.”).  22 Securities and Exchange Commission, “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related  Disclosures for Investors,” Federal Register 87 (69) (2022): 21334-21473, available at  https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-04-11/pdf/2022-06342.pdf.  
account for climate risks; the climate-related physical and transition risks reasonably  likely to have a material impact on borrowers’ current and expected assets and  operations; borrowers’ strategies for addressing those risks; borrowers’ Scopes 1, 2, and 3  greenhouse gas emissions (excluding offsets or renewable energy credits); and any other  risks that may affect borrowers’ creditworthiness in the future. This requested  information should relate to both physical- and transition-related risks. Banks should also  request geolocation information for significant borrower infrastructure (including  significant infrastructure up and down the value chain) and information about whether  borrowers have applied for climate-related insurance but have been rejected.  In addition to information provided by borrowers, banks should consider using  publicly available data. Useful data sources include publicly traded borrowers’ climate- related securities disclosures, borrowers’ competitors’ climate-related securities  disclosures, location-specific climate projections, and information regarding climate risks  to borrowers’ value chains. Importantly, banks cannot simply rely on historical data to  project future trends in climate change; climate events are occurring and intensifying in a  nonlinear fashion and will continue to do so into the future.23 Finally, banks should also  consider using independent consultants who have climate-related expertise and  knowledge about borrowers’ business sectors.  Question 4: Would regulations or guidelines prescribing particular risk  management practices be helpful to financial institutions as they adjust to doing  business in a changing climate?  The FDIC should consider issuing standards under section 39 of the Federal  Deposit Insurance Act relating to how banks manage their climate-related financial risks.24  Section 39 allows the FDIC to “prescribe standards relating to,” among other things, banks’  “internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems;” “loan  documentation;” credit underwriting;” and “other operational and managerial standards  as the [FDIC] determines to be appropriate” to ensure banks’ safety and soundness. If a  bank fails to adhere to promulgated standards, the FDIC may require the bank to submit  and follow a plan specifying actions it “will take to correct the deficiency.”  It is important that the FDIC prescribe standards that “invoke[] some underlying  purpose,” rather than one that “has a definite factual trigger.”25 This is consistent with the  existing FDIC standards promulgated under section 39, which includes among its  requirements that banks have internal controls for “[e]ffective risk assessment,” audit  systems that provide for “[i]ndependence and objectivity,” and credit underwriting  standards that “[a]re appropriate to the size of the institution.”26 The FDIC indicated that    23 Christian L. E. Franzke, “Nonlinear climate change,” Nature Climate Change 4 (2014): 423-424, available at  https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2245.    24 Legal Information Institute, “12 U.S. Code § 1831p–1 - Standards for safety and soundness,” available at  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/1831p-1 (last accessed May 2022); See generally Todd Phillips,  “In Support of Supervisory Guidance,” September 24, 2021, available at  https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3927856.   25 Bryan Lammon, “Rules, Standards, and Experimentation in Appellate Jurisdiction,” Ohio State Law Journal 74  (423) (2013): 423-461, available at  https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/71589/OSLJ_V74N3_0423.pdf. .  26 Legal Information Institute, “12 CFR Appendix A to Part 364 - Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards  for Safety and Soundness,” available at https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/appendix-A_to_part_364  (last accessed May 2022).  
such standards allow examiners “to identify and address problems at insured depository  institutions before capital becomes impaired… without dictating how institutions must be  managed and operated.”27  The benefit of issuing standards under section 39 are three-fold. First, doing so  would help banks understand the standard by which examiners will hold them. One study  found that this type of guidance “is a much-needed resource that [regulated parties] would  not want to do without—and may actively demand” as it can be used to “clarify vague  legislative rules” or statutes without necessitating an enforcement action.28 Second,  issuing section 39 standards would provide FDIC examiners a clearly legal means for  requiring banks to make necessary changes with a clear mechanism for appealing such  determinations.29 Finally, issuing these standards under section 39 would make clear that  climate-related financial risks are a safety and soundness concern. Some legislators have  indicated that they believe efforts by the FDIC and other banking regulators to address  climate-related financial risks are simply “advocating a certain set of social policies” such  as “addressing global warming or advancing so-called racial justice,”30 but courts can  review actions under section 39 to ensure that they address only valid safety and  soundness concerns.  Note, however, that standards issued as guidelines under section 39 are little  different from other guidance documents the FDIC could issue, except that they are more  vulnerable to being overturned by Congress under the Congressional Review Act. The  FDIC could accomplish the same goals with other guidance not issued under section 39.31  Question 5: What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to  successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management  frameworks?  No response to question 5.  Question 6: How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial  risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and  management?  No response to question 6.    27 Ibid.  28 Nicholas R.

Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when  identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?  No response to question 7.  Question 8: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies—for example,  insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments—do  financial institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial  risks?  Banks can use insurance and derivatives to hedge their climate-related risks at  both the loan and portfolio level. However, banks and regulators must recognize that  hedging cannot not remove risk entirely from their balance sheets; any contract to  transfer credit risk to another entity gives rise to counterparty risk because the  counterparty may fail to fulfill their side of the contract.  Banks face different risks from hedging strategies at both the loan and portfolio  level. At the loan level, banks frequently require borrowers to obtain and maintain  insurance coverage for the duration of their loan—for example, residential mortgage  borrowers are required to obtain homeowners insurance upon loan closure. However, as  areas become more subject to the catastrophic effects of climate change, such as with  changing flood maps, borrowers may be subject to increased premiums or even  discontinued coverage, leaving them without insurance.32 At the portfolio level, banks can  use catastrophe insurance, climate bonds, and various derivatives to hedge their climate- related financial risks.33 However, it is easy to imagine banks entering into weather  derivative contracts only to find that their counterparty’s balance sheet is negatively  correlated with the risk it is insuring against and could fail at just the time that the banks  need protection. Such a situation does not entirely remove risk from individual banks’  balance sheets but instead removes the credit risk and applies counterparty risk.  The use of insurance or derivatives to hedge risk also raises systemic risk  concerns. Just as how in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis many large financial  institutions relied on credit risk protection offered by AIG,34 one can imagine many large  banks today relying on a single institution for climate-risk protection. If those banks all  rely on one insurer and that insurer does not have a sufficiently strong balance sheet, none  would be fully protected.  Accordingly, the FDIC must understand what climate-risk insurance coverage is  being provided to banks, who is providing that coverage, and whether insurers’ balance  sheets are in any way correlated with the banks for which they are providing coverage. To  the extent that many banks have counterparty risk with a single counterparty, FSOC    32 Jie Jenny Zou, “Insuring catastrophe,” The Center for Public Integrity, February 25, 2020, available at  https://publicintegrity.org/environment/flood-insurance-climate-change-risk-inequality/.   33 See Patrick Henry, “Explainer: How catastrophe bonds help manage the risk of climate change,” World  Economic Forum, November 10, 2021, available at https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/catastrophe- bond-finance-insurance-climate-change-natural-disaster/.   34 Adam Davidson, “How AIG fell apart,” Reuters, September 18, 2008, available at  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-how-aig-fell-apart-idUSMAR85972720080918.  
should consider whether to designate that firm as systemically important and subject to  enhanced prudential standards.  Question 9: What, if any, climate-related financial products or services—for  example, “green bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other  instruments that take climate-related considerations into account—do financial  institutions offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or  services pose?  No response to question 9.  Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of  climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on  households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged  communities? Should the agencies modify existing regulations and guidance, such  as those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act, to address the impact  climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged  communities?  The FDIC’s principles note that climate change “could include potentially  disproportionate impact on the financially vulnerable, including low- to moderate-income  (LMI) and other disadvantaged households and communities,” and, accordingly, it is  especially important that the FDIC help ensure institutions continue to provide services to  these households and communities. Although there may be additional means of tackling  this, the FDIC should take three specific actions.     First, the FDIC should work with the other federal banking agencies to update their  Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rules to ensure that credit flows to LMI and other  disadvantaged communities to help these communities reduce their fossil fuel emissions  and protect themselves from climate impacts.35 Currently, banking deserts—often in  central cities and rural areas—are excluded from the benefits promised by the CRA  because they are not in any institution’s assessment area. The FDIC should update its CRA  regulations to ensure that institutions with a nationwide presence direct investment into  all underserved communities, not only those surrounding physical branches. Further, the  FDIC should explore a climate resilience and environmental justice finance mandate for  the CRA, which would give institutions credit for providing loans for projects such as  energy efficient and climate resilient affordable housing, installation of community solar  energy projects, and others.36  Second, the FDIC must ensure that banks consider whether their climate risk  mitigation efforts have fair lending implications and must ensure agency examiners and  enforcement officials can sufficiently identify issues that may result in discrimination. A  number of laws to which banks are subject—including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,    35 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, “Agencies Issue Joint Proposal to Strengthen and Modernize  Community Reinvestment Act Regulations,” Press release, May 5, 2022, available at  https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22039.html.   36 See generally Michela Zonta and Caius Willingham, “A CRA To Meet the Challenge of Climate Change,”  American Progress, December 17, 2020, available at https://www.americanprogress.org/article/cra-meet- challenge-climate-change/. 
the Fair Housing Act, Community Reinvestment Act, and regulations thereunder—prohibit  discrimination based on several protected characteristics.37   Discrimination may be demonstrated through not only “[o]vert evidence of  disparate treatment,” but also “[e]vidence of disparate impact.”38 Disparate treatment  occurs “when a lender openly discriminates on a prohibited basis,” whereas disparate  impact occurs when “a lender applies a racially or otherwise neutral policy or practice  equally to all credit applicants, but the policy or practice disproportionately excludes or  burdens certain persons on a prohibited basis.”39  It is particularly important for banks to ensure that climate risk mitigation efforts  do not discriminate against the borrowers who are already disproportionately impacted  by climate change. Unfortunately, impacts from climate change pose one such risk, as  climate-induced or -exacerbated natural disasters and sea level rise has been found to  disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color.40 A  literature review conducted by staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found “that  regions of the United States that are home to above-average shares of low-income and  minority groups are likely to suffer the greatest meteorological effects of climate  change.”41 Even more, it found “that low-income and minority Americans are limited in  how they may adapt to climate change because they have less access to insurance and are  less likely to have access to credit when needed.”42  Accordingly, the FDIC should consider providing guidance to explain how banks  could inadvertently engage in discriminatory practices when addressing climate-related  financial risks in order to ensure continued access to credit for climate-affected  communities. The FDIC should also instruct agency examiners and enforcement officials to  recognize that discrimination can occur as banks begin taking steps to address climate  risks.  Finally, the FDIC should issue guidance detailing how institutions may continue  extending credit to vulnerable communities in a safe and sound manner.

particularly focus on how institutions may safely lend for the purchase and installation of  residential solar panels, which are the types of high-dollar, long-term, uncollateralized  loans that institutions are traditionally reticent to make.  Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models  from borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify,  measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do  financial institutions currently obtain this information? What gaps and other  concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools or models?  When making loans, banks typically rely on information disclosed by borrowers,  and banks should request climate-related information from their counterparties. The  Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed climate disclosure rule provides  good examples of the types of information that banks should be requesting from their  borrowers,43 including information about how corporate borrowers’ governance policies  account for climate risks; the climate-related physical and transition risks reasonably  likely to have a material impact on borrowers’ current and expected assets and  operations; borrowers’ strategies for addressing those risks; borrowers’ Scopes 1, 2, and 3  greenhouse gas emissions (excluding offsets or renewable energy credits); and any other  risks that may affect borrowers’ creditworthiness in the future. This requested  information should relate to both physical- and transition-related risks. Banks should also  request geolocation information for significant borrower infrastructure (including  significant infrastructure up and down the value chain) and information about whether  borrowers have applied for climate-related insurance but have been rejected.  Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented  to better capture financial institutions' exposure to climate-related financial risks?  Public disclosure is an important facet of bank regulation to ensure safety and  soundness. The Basel Committee on Bank Supervision explains that disclosure “seek[s] to  provide market participants with sufficient information to assess an … active bank's  material risks and capital adequacy,” and the FSOC notes that “[p]ublic, high-quality  climate-related disclosures by companies that … are regulated as a financial institution …  will better inform investors and market participants about the climate-related risks to  those entities.”44 Providing disclosure of climate-related risks can help investors make  better capital allocation decisions and can enable them to assist bank managements  managers in instituting improved risk management practices. It can also help regulators  and investors understand where the banking industry as a whole is making loans.  The FSOC notes that “[g]aps in disclosure … exist with respect to banks,” as “[b]ank  and savings and loan holding companies not subject to SEC filing requirements represent  3,855 entities with about $3.1 trillion in total assets,” and “the majority of banks that are  not part of a holding company are exempt from SEC-related disclosures,” and that bank    43 Securities and Exchange Commission, “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related  Disclosures for Investors.”  44 Bank for International Settlements, “Pillar 3 framework - Executive Summary,” June 27, 2019, available at   https://www.bis.org/fsi/fsisummaries/pillar3_framework.htm; Financial Stability Oversight Council, “Report  on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” p. 67.   
Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (call reports) “could benefit from further  enhancement and integration with other data sources.”45  The FDIC should work with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)  and Federal Reserve Board to amend their call reports and any other required reports to  include relevant fields related to banks’ climate-related financial risks. At minimum, line  items should be added to each applicable schedule that detail banks’ loans for or securities  backing fossil fuel exploration, extraction, and electricity generation; for or backing assets  subject to physical risk (broken out by type of weather event); and for or backing assets  subject to transition risk.   In addition to these particular line items, the FDIC should also consider providing  methods or standards by which banks can account for their greenhouse gas emissions.  The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), for example, has developed  standards by which banks and other financial institutions can calculate their financed  emissions. While we do not necessarily recommend that the FDIC adopt the PCAF  standards outright—we believe that having regulators write standards themselves  “avoid[s] the potential legal, policy, and administrative risks of delegating that authority to  a third party” while still relying on “[p]rivate standard-setters [to] help advance the  techniques and science behind standards and develop best practices”46—we do think that  some standards should be articulated to ensure reliable, consistent, and comparable  disclosures between institutions.  Questions 13 and 14: How do financial institutions use climate scenario models,  analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? What factors are most salient  for the FDIC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises?  We appreciate the FDIC’s commitment to ensuring the largest banks conduct some  form of climate scenario analysis. Scenario analysis, which the FDIC describes as an  “exercise[] used to conduct a forward-looking assessment of the potential impact on an  institution of changes in the economy, financial system, or the distribution of physical  hazards resulting from climate-related risks,” is important in that it can help banks  understand their susceptibility to climate change risks.   In addition to institutions with assets above $100 billion, mid-size, regional banks  should be required to undertake climate-related scenario analyses as well. Regional banks,  with portfolios that may not be as diversified as those of larger institutions, may  experience higher rates of failure and branch closures as a consequence of natural  disasters that affect only one geographic area. Accordingly, safety and soundness concerns  necessitate climate scenario analyses for mid-size institutions, though those analyses may  not need to be as rigorous as the ones for larger banks so long as they help institutions  gain a better understanding of the climate risks they face.     45 Financial Stability Oversight Council, “Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” p. 63, 86.    46 Dylan Bruce and others, “The SEC Should Write Its Own Environmental, Social, and Governance Rules,”  Center for American Progress, December 13, 2021, available at  https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-sec-should-write-its-own-environmental-social-and- governance-rules/.  
When developing climate scenario analysis guidance, we encourage the FDIC to  keep in mind several key points.  a. The FDIC must begin conducting scenario analyses quickly, and the first scenarios may be  somewhat simplistic.  It is important for institutions to begin conducting their analyses quickly in order  to learn from them and take action as soon as possible. To that end, it is not necessary that  the FDIC’s initial scenarios be perfect. Just as with the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests and the  Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, scenario analysis is an  evolving effort that will improve after each iteration. We expect the first scenarios  provided by the FDIC to be somewhat simplistic and to become more comprehensive as  the FDIC and banks learn from prior years’ analyses and as climate scientists gather  additional information.  b. The FDIC must provide multiple scenarios to banks describing orderly and disorderly  transitions.  The FDIC must provide at least three common scenarios to banks:  (1) One that provides for an orderly transition that “assume[s] climate policies are  introduced early and become gradually more stringent” and “[b]oth physical  and transition risks are relatively subdued;”  (2) One that provides for a disorderly transition that assumes “higher transition  risk due to policies being delayed or divergent across countries and sectors;”  and  (3) One that provides a hot-house scenario that “[a]ssume[s] that some climate  policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but global efforts are  insufficient to halt significant global warming,” and “[c]ritical temperature  thresholds are exceeded leading to severe physical risks and irreversible  impacts like sea-level rise.”47  These scenarios should provide for a broad range of plausible outcomes with respect to  global emissions, tipping points, and the speed with which the global transition to clean  energy, and should set short-, medium-, and long-term analysis windows of 3-5 years, 5- 10 years, and 30 years.  The FDIC’s scenarios must account for the correlated nature of physical and  transition risks. These risks can manifest themselves not just as discrete events, but also  as events occurring in series and in parallel. For example, natural disasters can cause  physical damage that consequently result in productivity losses, and technological  innovations that reduce dependency on fossil fuels can beget further innovations.  Lastly, the FDIC should also look to other jurisdictions and U.S. regulatory agencies  for input on its scenarios, though it need not harmonize with those other jurisdictions. We  recommend the FDIC utilize the scenarios for the National Climate Assessment as a basis    47 NGFS, “Scenarios Portal,” available at https://www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal/ (last accessed May  2022).  
for its initial scenarios,48 as well as resources developed by other federal agencies, such as  the Environmental Protection Agency’s summaries of research investigating the sectoral  impacts of climate change.49 The FDIC can also base its initial scenarios off the work of the  Network for Greening the Financial System and other jurisdictions that have begun  conducting their own climate scenario analyses, including the European Central Bank,50  the Bank of England,51 the Bank of Canada,52 the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,53 and  others.  c. The FDIC must ensure banks’ models are sufficiently rigorous and avoid obvious pitfalls.  The FDIC—through the use of guidance and examinations—must ensure that  banks’ models are sufficiently rigorous so as to be useful. There are several key points that  the FDIC must ensure banks consider. First, banks should not be allowed to “model shop.”  The climate scenario analysis process is about helping banks understand their climate- related financial risks—not about optimizing capital, penalizing institutions, or appeasing  regulators. To that end, the process of creating or identifying a model is itself just as  important as the outcome, and model shopping to attain the “optimal” outcome should be  discouraged. Additionally, models should be sector- and location-specific and that the  assumptions made by banks’ models should be clear and transparent. Some sectors will be  less susceptible to climate-related financial risks than others even if they are in the same  location, and data sources that aggregate information can mask important variations in  data.54 Similarly, it is imperative that banks understand any assumptions that are baked  into the models they use so bankers and the FDIC understand where models’ blind spots  may be. Finally, models most must take into consideration network effects within the  financial sector, as institutions may face rapid asset repricing that affects not only asset  owners but holders of those owners’ securities or debt. Additionally, banks may face runs  and the banking system as a whole may experience contagion and overall instability.  Models must take these considerations into account.  ***        48 U.S. Global Change Research Program, “Scenarios for the National Climate Assessment,” available at  https://scenarios.globalchange.gov/ (last accessed May 2022).  49 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, “Technical Documentation on The Framework for Evaluating  Damages and Impacts (FrEDI)” (Washington: 2021), p. 15-16, available at  https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-10/technical-documentation-on-the-framework-for- evaluating-damages-and-impacts_maintext.pdf.  50 Spyros Alogoskoufis and others, “ECB Economy-Wide Climate Stress Test” (Frankfurt: European Central  Bank, 2021), available at https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op281~05a7735b1c.en.pdf.  51 Bank of England, “Guidance for participants of the 2021 Biennial Exploratory Scenario: Financial risks from  climate change” (London: 2021), available at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/stress- testing/2021/the-2021-biennial-exploratory-scenario-on-the-financial-risks-from-climate-change.pd.    52 Bank of Canada, “Using Scenario Analysis to Assess Climate Transition Risk” (Ottawa: 2021), available at  https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BoC-OSFI-Using-Scenario-Analysis-to-Assess- Climate-Transition-Risk.pdf.   53 Hong Kong Monetary Authority, “Pilot Banking Sector Climate Risk Stress Test” (Hong Kong: 2021),  available at https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-functions/banking- stability/Pilot_banking_sector_climate_risk_stress_test.pdf.   54 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, “The Use of Scenario Analysis in Disclosure of Climate- related Risks and Opportunities,” available at https://www.tcfdhub.org/scenario-analysis/ (last accessed May  2022).

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street, NW  Washington, DC 20429    RE: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions; Comment Request (RIN 3064-ZA32)  Dear Mr. Sheesley,  Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the FDIC’s Principles for Climate-Related Financial  Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.  This letter is being sent on behalf of MidWestOne Bank  (hereafter referred to as “the Bank”).    MidWestOne Bank is an Iowa chartered bank founded on October 15, 1934.  The Bank is focused on  delivering relationship-based business and personal banking products and services. The Bank provides  commercial, real estate, agricultural, credit card, and consumer loans. The Bank also provides deposit  products including demand and interest checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts,  and time deposits. Complementary to our loan and deposit products, the Bank provides additional products  and services including treasury management, Zelle, online and mobile banking, debit cards, ATMs, and  safe deposit boxes. The Bank offers its products and services primarily through its network of 56 full-service  banking offices, located throughout central and eastern Iowa, the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area  of Minnesota, western Wisconsin, Naples and Fort Myers, Florida, and Denver, Colorado. The Bank also  offers comprehensive wealth management solutions for its customers through its trust department, which  offers services including the administration of estates, personal trusts, and conservatorships and the  management of real property, as well as investment services, including financial planning, investment  advisory, and retail securities brokerage services.  MidWestOne Bank is primarily regulated by the Federal  Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) and as of March 31, 2022, had total assets of $5.96 billion.  We understand that given the $100 billion threshold on the current statement of principles that they would  not technically apply to the Bank.  However, we are choosing to comment on these principles because the  FDIC has indicated that this is the first iteration of guidelines that may ultimately apply to all FDIC banks.   We appreciate the FDIC’s recognition that these principles would impose significant burdens if applied to  smaller banks.  We believe that guidance should not be expanded to smaller institutions until climate risk  is better quantified and understood and should be tailored to avoid unnecessary operational burdens.   The Bank is working on an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risk assessment across all  departments of the bank identifying enterprise-wide environmental impact which includes climate-related  risk as the primary environmental risk factor. The reach of climate-related risk is very broad across the Bank  and determining key metrics and data to track in this area will take an extended amount of time and  resources to implement.   
Climate-related risk is already incorporated into the Bank’s existing risk-management frameworks.  Banks  base business decisions on current and historical market data, which provides information on the risk of a  transaction.  Accordingly, climate-related risks are naturally embedded into the risk identification and  management process.  These current risk management practices are effective and have enabled  community banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. Compliance with an additional climate- related risk management framework would be costly and duplicative of current practices. The Bank currently  manages climate-related risk through existing practices including branch location analysis, lending policies  and procedures, concentration risk monitoring and adequate insurance requirements for both the Bank and  loan customers to protect against natural disasters.  These practices have proved to be effective as the  Bank and its customers have endured droughts, hurricanes, floods, tornados, and a derecho.  Supervisory expectations should be flexible, allowing for significant modification as events occur, as the  practice of climate risk identification develops, and the risks become more clearly defined.  Regulation  based on the assumptions and data behind today’s definitions and understanding of climate-related  financial risk would be premature.  The FDIC should take a flexible, high-level approach that allows banks  to assess their risks based on their unique circumstances.  Community banks are critical to thriving communities, providing financing to individuals, companies, and  communities.  To avoid economic disruption or harm, prudential regulators should not impose prescriptive  regulatory requirements on climate-related risks.  Doing so at this time of economic stress, particularly  with respect to transition risks, could shape bank business decisions for regulatory reasons, rather than  true safety and soundness concerns.

The Kansas Bankers Association (KBA) was organized in 1887. The KBA 's membership includes 99% of the 211 banks andsavings & loans headquartered in Kansas as well as 20 out-of-state commercial banks         operating in Kansas The Kansas banking industry employs more than 22,000 Kansans that provide financial services inevery county across the state.   As we understand the proposal; it is designed to provide direction on how Jarge banks should incorporate climate-related risk into their overall risk management framework; but our comments will be inclusive of the entire industry as we believe there have been indications that this proposal is an initial step with climate risk management expectations for small institutions likely to follow As a state whose economy is heavily reliant on the agriculture and the energy industries, financial institutions operating in Kansas have taken into account climate-related riskfor a verylong -time. On a daily basis, their business decisions are based on an assessment of market data related to the climate risk involved. Across the state, this data isverydifferent as there is great fluctuations in the historical climate trends andeverybanker has to be cognizant of this for their region: Climate-  related  financial risk is so naturally embedded into these decisions that it seems odd to be addressing it as a separate proposal.  We believe that is why climate risk is so difficult to quantify it is such an integral part of the overall risk assessment banks conduct that it is not asingle consideration in making & decision. There is no specific measurement or standard that would fit every circumstance and trying to single it out would be extremely burdensome to all banks but significantly so for small institutions      We  would urge the FDIC to take a broader look at this topic so as to understand its place in overall risk assessment and not try to quantify it on its own.

The FDIC should be                       supportive of local access to financial services and not try to limit the industry' $ ability to serve its                             business community.

We encourage the FDIC to clarify in any final statement what exactly “broad aspects of the economy”  means and how that may impact how banks (of all sizes) are expected to mitigate risks on “broader aspects  of the economy.”  Are community banks going to face an expectation that they manage the type of  legitimate industries they can provide products and services to at the expense of the communities they  serve?     C. General    The primary problem community banks would have, should these expectations ‘trickle down,’ is the lack  of clear guidance from the agencies that take into consideration the limited expertise available in smaller  communities. This could certainly lead to banks being required to have a ‘Climate Officer.’     D. Current Risk Management Practices    Community banks already use a number of factors to identify potential climate risk already incorporated  into various agency guidance on credit risk, the primary risk for community banks in this arena.     E. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting    The request seems to imply that banks will be expected to request “climate‐related data, metrics, tools  and models from borrowers and other counterparties” to identify, measure, monitor and control their  own climate‐related financial risks.     Ambiguity about adding to the regulatory burden community banks face beyond the risk management  framework already existing in current FDIC rules and guidance will only accelerate the consolidation of  the community banking industry, to the detriment of consumers and communities.    F. Scenario Analysis    Community banks simply do not have the manpower nor expertise to develop or implement “climate  scenario models, analysis or tools.” The FDIC should make it clear that community banks will not now ‐ or  in the future – be expected to develop expensive scenarios beyond CECL and existing risk management  techniques.      Texas community bankers are well aware of climate risk and the impact it has on the general economy  and  the  communities  they  serve.    Before  adoption  of  any  final  statement,  the  FDIC  should  carefully  consider  the  impact  it  would  have  on  community  banks  across  the  country  and  clarify  the  explicit  expectations on those banks.     Sincerely,    Christopher L. Williston, CAE  President and CEO","The Independent Bankers Association of Texas (IBAT) submitted comments on the FDIC's draft principles for managing climate-related financial risks.

In sum, we believe that Final Guidance that is closely based on the FDIC  Draft Guidance would support the work of financial institutions with respect to their climate-related  financial risk management and would provide them with the flexibility that will allow them to do this  work efficiently and effectively. We appreciate this opportunity to provide additional thoughts and look  forward to engaging in further conversations on this topic with you and your team.  As FDIC Chairman Gruenberg and many others have made clear,2 climate change and its  associated financial risks are a global problem, necessitating dialog and coordination among regulatory  and supervisory bodies across all jurisdictions. Disparate initiatives on climate-related financial risk  across various jurisdictions could lead to circumstances in which different sets of requirements result in  inefficient and duplicative efforts or even conflict with one another. To that end, the IIB applauds the  FDIC’s decision3 to join the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial  System, as well as its domestic coordination on climate-related financial regulatory work, including as a  member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). We urge the FDIC to continue its  cooperative efforts with domestic and international regulators, as well as with industry participants.   We especially applaud the FDIC for its cooperation with its domestic counterparts, including with  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) on the OCC’s own recent “Principles for  Climate-Related Financial Risk Management” (the “OCC Draft Principles”).4 This kind of coordination    1 FDIC, Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions,  87 Fed.

2    is critical to achieving a consistent regulatory regime for climate-related financial risk management, and  the alignment between the draft principles of the FDIC and the OCC is encouraging.   Given the substantive similarities between the FDIC Draft Principles and the OCC Draft  Principles, we offer below a high-level overview of our feedback and attach the IIB’s comment letter  submitted to the OCC, which addresses in considerable detail the text of the proposed principles.   At a high level, the IIB’s comments focus on the following three points:  •  The Final Guidance should continue to recognize that methodologies, models, and data  for analyzing climate-related financial risk remain a work in progress;  •  Domestic and international cooperation around consistent and comparable climate-related  financial risk management principles is critical; and  •  Any final guidance should consider the unique structure and governance of  internationally headquartered financial institutions.    We believe that the FDIC Draft Principles embody a principles-based approach that would  provide an internationally headquartered financial institution (which is subject to the laws and regulations  of a non-U.S. jurisdiction on a consolidated, enterprise-wide basis) with the necessary flexibility to  consider the regulatory posture of its home country and internationally agreed upon standards. Any Final  Guidance that is consistent with the FDIC Draft Principles would be helpful and effective. If there are any  material developments to the FDIC Draft Principles beyond the high-level approach already taken, we  would expect that these developments would be open for additional review and comment to give industry  and other stakeholders the chance to weigh in on these important issues.  The IIB supports the FDIC’s approach to climate-related financial risk, and we appreciate the  opportunity to share our perspective. We are, of course, available to discuss these comments and the  specific concerns and experiences of our members, and we look forward to engaging in further  conversation on this topic with you. Thank you for your consideration.  Sincerely,  Briget Polichene  Chief Executive Officer      Enclosure: IIB comment letter of February 14, 2022

We believe that Final Guidance closely based on the  Draft Principles would effectively support and provide the needed flexibility to advance the efforts of  financial institutions with respect to their climate-related financial risk management. We appreciate this  opportunity to provide additional thoughts and look forward to engaging in further conversations on this  topic with you.   A. IIB’s Distinctive Perspective  The IIB represents internationally headquartered financial institutions from over 35 countries  around the world doing business in the United States. The IIB’s members consist principally of  international banks that operate branches and agencies, bank subsidiaries, and broker-dealer subsidiaries  in the United States.   Our members believe that financial institutions have an important role to play in facilitating the  climate-related transition objectives of their clients and approach the topic of climate change and financial  risk from an international perspective. Many of our members are headquartered in jurisdictions where  financial regulators are in the process of implementing, or have implemented, regulations and supervisory  expectations pertaining to climate-related financial risk. For instance, regulators in some of the  jurisdictions of our members have formally assessed how financial institutions are managing climate-   1   OCC, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021). 
2  related financial risk as compared to supervisory expectations or are asking financial institutions to  conduct scenario analyses. In addition, many of our members already have deployed considerable  resources toward the management of climate-related financial risk, including by developing greater  internal climate risk management expertise (such as hiring dedicated personnel and teams), modeling and  undertaking scenario analyses, and engaging with regulators on these issues.   We come to this Request for Feedback with enthusiasm about what principles-based,  internationally consistent climate risk management guidance stands to achieve. We believe that a  principles-based Final Guidance provides the best avenue for allowing financial institutions to make  tailored risk management decisions and operate under multiple international regulatory regimes. As  organizations in the business of managing risk, financial institutions are uniquely well-suited to help their  clients meet their climate objectives and manage the challenges that a transition to a lower carbon  economy could entail, while remaining focused on the financial institution’s own management of physical  and transition risks. Financial institutions have a role to play in the efforts of their clients to further  climate-related transition objectives, including those clients operating in traditionally carbon-intensive  industries. Participation in these efforts likely will take different forms and differ among financial  institutions across timelines and geographies. Consequently, flexible, principles-based guidance – in  contrast to prescriptive requirements2 – maximizes the chances that financial institutions can bring  innovation and resources to better support the climate-related transitions of their clients.   We would be pleased to meet with you to discuss the Request for Feedback and provide you with  information about practices in non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as our experiences with clients and other  regulators. Further, under the understanding that the federal banking regulators are in dialog on this issue,  we have copied the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board”) and the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) on this letter. We also have copied the New York State  Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”), which has also been focusing on climate-related risk  management.   Below, we offer some additional considerations and request some key clarifications in relation to  the issuance of any Final Guidance.  B. The Final Guidance Should Continue to Recognize that Methodologies, Models, and Data  for Analyzing Climate-Related Financial Risk Remain a Work in Progress     We appreciate the OCC’s acknowledgement in the Draft Principles that “incorporation of  material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as measurement  methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time.” As  the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s (“FSOC”) recent report similarly notes, “Defining,  identifying, measuring, and monitoring exposures to climate-related financial risks will necessitate  investment in data and analytic capacity by FSOC members, other government agencies, and the private  sector.”3       2   As Governor Brainard has stated in the context of climate risk, “We would not tell banks which sectors to  lend to or which sector to not lend.” See also Board Chair Jerome Powell, as quoted in Law360 (Jan. 11, 2022)  (“Climate is appropriate for us as an issue to the extent it fits within our existing mandates. I think it does, in the  sense of it’s another risk over time that banks are going to run. But the broader answer to climate change has to  come from legislators and the private sector”).     3   FSOC, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021). 
3  Methodologies, models, and data for analyzing climate-related financial risk remain a work in  progress. To take the example of data gaps, financial institutions are both producers and consumers of  data. A financial institution can only fully evaluate its own financial risks by drawing upon relevant and  appropriate data situated outside the financial institution’s own operations. Such data must be collected  from its clients, counterparties, and transactions, and there is no question that consistent and comparable  data is not always easily available and does not always exist.4 For example, broad corporate public  disclosure lacks standardization, rigor, and granularity, and forward-looking data from clients on their  transition plans is weak at best. While these sources mature, banks must continue to rely upon  approximations and extrapolations derived from less direct data sources.     We believe that financial institutions should continue working to identify and understand gaps in  methodologies, models, and data. As Acting Comptroller Hsu suggested in a recent speech, the risk  management processes of banks and the questions that their boards should start posing to management  can have an important role in illuminating gaps in information and tools.5 These endeavors will be non- trivial given the multitude of overlapping, often inconsistent, and rapidly evolving private and public  sector definitions and measurement approaches to climate risk, reporting regimes, and the vetting of  numerous regionally limited third-party data offerings. Even as data becomes more available, the  proliferation of definitions and measurement approaches could complicate the efforts of financial  institutions to incorporate this information into their risk management frameworks. Thus, such efforts will  take time and likely will necessitate cooperation between regulators and the financial services industry.     Scenario analysis as a risk management tool also remains in development, and the accuracy and  effectiveness of scenario analysis depends on the availability of high-quality data, as well as  advancements in modeling over medium and long time horizons. The Draft Principles make clear that  scenario analysis is just one tool alongside others in enhancing climate-related financial risk management.  Any Final Guidance should continue this position, and additionally make clear that scenario analysis is a  separate exercise, distinct from traditional stress testing, and is not intended to affect capital requirements  or supervisory actions regarding U.S. operations. We believe that attempts by other jurisdictions to  incorporate scenario analysis into stress tests or capital requirements are premature6 and have created  confusion based on how nascent measurement methodologies and data would influence current capital  requirements. To maximize the potential effectiveness of any guidance related to scenario analysis, we  would urge further dialog between regulators and industry. We would be pleased to discuss our  experiences with scenario analysis in other jurisdictions with the OCC.     4   Like the OCC, domestic and international regulators and standard-setting bodies have acknowledged the  data gaps that affect the measurement of climate-related financial risk. Reports by a number of authorities have  emphasized this important issue. See, e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), Climate-related  financial risks – measurement methodologies (Apr. 14, 2021); Networking for Greening the Financial System  (“NGFS”), Progress report on bridging data gaps (June 3, 2021); Financial Stability Board, The Availability of  Data with Which to Monitor and Assess Climate-Related Risks to Financial Stability (July 7, 2021); FSOC, Report  on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021); European Systemic Risk Board, Positively green: Measuring  climate change risks to financial stability (June 8, 2020); Climate Financial Risk Forum, Climate Data and Metrics,  (Oct. 21, 2021). See also Board Gov. Lael Brainard, “Building Climate Scenario Analysis on the Foundations of  Economic Research” (Oct. 7, 2021).    5   Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu, “Five Climate Questions Every Bank Board Should  Ask” (Nov. 8, 2021).   6   See, e.g., Sec. Janet Yellen, as quoted in Bloomberg Law (Feb. 2, 2022) (“It’s just premature at this point to  talk about raising capital requirements . . . it’s really important that regulators do the groundwork that’s necessary  for them to evaluate risks to individual firms”) and Board Gov. Lael Brainard, “The Role of Financial Institutions in  Tackling the Challenges of Climate Change” (Feb. 18, 2021) (“To be clear, scenario analysis is distinct from our  traditional regulatory stress tests at banks”).   
4  If finalized largely as written, the Draft Principles would allow sufficient leeway for, and  encourage, the continued development of methods, models, and data to quantify and understand climate- related financial risks.     C. Domestic and International Cooperation Around Consistent and Comparable Climate  Change Risk Management Principles Is Critical    The risks and effects of climate change are rarely confined within state or national borders,  making dialog and coordination among regulators essential. Disparate initiatives on climate-related  financial risks among various jurisdictions could lead to circumstances in which different sets of  requirements result in inefficient and duplicative efforts (or even worse, conflict with each other).     We applaud the OCC for its international work (e.g., participation in the NGFS as well as the  BCBS’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks), its climate-related work under the FSOC  umbrella, and other initiatives such as the creation of the Climate Change Risk Officer position, one of  the aims of which was to expand the OCC’s capacity to coordinate with stakeholders, and more. We urge  the OCC to continue its coordination efforts among U.S. and international regulators (as the OCC  indicated it would in development of the Final Guidance), as well as its dialog with industry participants.  To foster clarity and efficiency, the Final Guidance should reflect the aggregate views of the U.S.  prudential regulators (the Board, the FDIC, and the OCC) and, to the extent possible, consistency with  state-level regulators. Inconsistent or uncoordinated guidance is likely to come at the expense of effective  risk management.     Internationally headquartered financial institutions develop their risk management and strategic  decisions for the consolidated organization at the level of head office, and the institution is subject to the  laws and regulations of a non-U.S. jurisdiction on a consolidated, enterprise-wide basis. Consequently, a  key consideration for an internationally headquartered financial institution is whether it can use the work  that the financial institution does to understand, quantify, and manage climate-related financial risk in one  jurisdiction across the organization to meet the expectations of other jurisdictions. Final Guidance that is  flexible and principles-based, as the Draft Principles are, will allow for the development of  methodologies, models, and data that are fit for multiple purposes across entities and geographies,  including both host and home country supervisory expectations. Moreover, additional multinational and  international frameworks for data, risk measurement, and other key financial institution tasks will  undoubtedly be developed and adopted, and we urge the OCC to maintain sufficient flexibility such that a  financial institution’s adoption of those international standards will exhibit compliance with U.S.  regulatory expectations as well. We believe that Final Guidance that incorporates the principles-based  expectations of the Draft Principles would provide internationally headquartered financial institutions  with the necessary flexibility to consider the regulatory postures of their home countries and of  internationally agreed upon standards.     Even in the context of internationally consistent and comparable risk management guidance,  issues will remain that should be addressed through cooperation among regulators. To name just a few  examples, entities within an affiliated financial institution group that are subject to the rules of different  jurisdictions are likely to encounter inconsistent timing requirements for implementation or for meeting  regulatory expectations. Furthermore, the Draft Principles, like other climate-related financial risk  management pronouncements by international regulators and standard-setters, use the term “material.”  Guidance from the OCC and other U.S. regulators should clarify that each institution should be able to  make decisions of materiality based on its own facts, circumstances, geographical footprint, home country  regulator, and other similar factors. In addition, “materiality” also has a specific meaning in the securities  law context, and regulators should acknowledge that the investor focus of the securities laws and their  disclosure requirements (including conservative development of forward-looking risk factors) does not 
5  necessarily equate to what may be material for safety, soundness, and risk management purposes. These  competing meanings of “materiality” provide just one example of the importance of flexible, principles- based guidance.    D. Any Final Guidance Should Consider the Unique Structure and Governance of  Internationally Headquartered Financial Institutions    An important undercurrent to our comments is the theme of adaptability and iteration. We believe  that flexible, principles-based Final Guidance in the same vein as the Draft Principles would best  accommodate the ever-evolving climate risk management landscape. Supervisory activity stemming from  the Final Guidance also should consider the reality that best practices around climate-related financial risk  management remain in development and should support rather than dictate the efforts of firms to refine,  readjust, and revisit their approaches in light of evolving capabilities and circumstances. To that end, any  Final Guidance should constitute “guidance” under the OCC’s framework for guidance.7 We also would  expect that the OCC would provide reasonable timeframes for banks to incorporate the principles of the  Final Guidance into their risk management processes. Rather than require conformance with the new  guidance by a certain date, the Final Guidance should focus on ensuring that banks are working  effectively, in good faith, to establish and evolve their climate-related financial risk management  practices. Any timeframes for implementing the Final Guidance should reflect and accommodate the  iterative nature of climate-related financial risk management, particularly given limitations with respect to  models, methodology, and data, as well as potential compliance obligations in different jurisdictions.    We applaud the OCC for its statement that it will tailor the Final Guidance “to reflect differences  in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.” There are many different  factors that shape a bank’s climate-related financial risk profile (for example, even institutions that are the  same size could have very different climate-related risk exposures). As previously mentioned, for  internationally headquartered banks operating in the United States, the unique structure of their operations  reflects a further need for appropriate tailoring to take into account the fact that enterprise-wide risk  management principles, analyses, and business strategies are established by a bank’s board and  management at head office, and any risk management policies, procedures, and principles applied in the  United States must necessarily be consistent with those enterprise-wide mandates. We also would ask that  the OCC clarify that the Draft Principles (and subsequent Final Guidance) apply only to federal branches /  agencies that have over $100 billion in total consolidated assets at the branch or the agency level and,  separately, to internationally headquartered national bank subsidiaries of financial institutions that have  over $100 billion in total consolidated assets.      We believe that Final Guidance that reflects the principles-based approach of the Draft Principles  would be helpful and effective. If there is any material development of the Draft Principles beyond the  high-level approach already taken (as we note that the OCC indicated that it likely would present a more  granular Final Guidance taking into account additional views from the Board and FDIC, as well as further  research into climate-related financial risk management), we would expect that these developments would  be open to additional review and comment to give industry and other stakeholders the chance to weigh in  on these important issues.     *  *  *      7   OCC, Role of Supervisory Guidance, 86 Fed.

Sheesley Assistant Executive Secretary Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 550 17th Street NW Washington, DC 20429 RE: FDIC Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions Attention: Docket ID FDIC-2022-07065; RIN 3064-ZA32 To whom it may concern, The 14 undersigned organizations welcome the opportunity to comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC’s) Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions. We support this important step toward addressing climate risk in the banking system, and many of our organizations have also written in other comments to support strengthening the draft principles with respect to tailoring for banks of all sizes, ensuring robust climate scenario analysis, and aligning banks’ climate commitments with their internal strategies and governance. We write specifically here to urge the FDIC to carefully consider the potential impacts of climate supervisory guidance on racial, economic, environmental, and climate justice, and how these expectations will interact with fair lending principles and regulation and consumer financial protections. Prudential climate financial regulation is vital to protecting the banking system and the deposit insurance fund, and it must not result in additional burdens on vulnerable communities and households, the very consumers who are most at risk from climate impacts. To this end, it is critical that the FDIC expand its climate risk guidance to all banks in a way that recognizes the important role credit and banking services should play in helping vulnerable communities in building resilience to and mitigating climate disasters. Such guidance should include how banks can and should maintain the operational resilience of the critical services they provide. It should also encourage both large and small banks to support community investment in adaptation instead of withdrawing credit, to finance green investment, and to protect consumers from unsafe “green” financial products that lack adequate consumer protections and/or do not deliver purported climate benefits. The FDIC should also strengthen and finalize its recent proposal1 on Community Reinvestment Act regulations and guidance to address the impact of climate-related financial risks on LMI and communities of color, and harmonize these efforts. 1 ​FDIC, OCC, FRB, “Joint Proposal to Strengthen and Modernize Community Reinvestment Act Regulations,” 5 May 2022. https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22018.html
LMI communities, communities of color, and the banks that serve them are more vulnerable to physical risks from climate impacts. Decades of racist housing, lending, and siting policies–many created and perpetuated by the federal government itself–that denied households and communities of color equitable access to financial services have resulted in massive racial and economic disparities in wealth, climate vulnerability, environmental justice, and public health. These policies have segregated people of color and lower income households into neighborhoods that face not only higher levels of toxic pollution (e.g., from fossil fuel infrastructure) but also far greater physical vulnerability to climate impacts like flooding2 and extreme heat3 that harm infrastructure, public health, and local economies. In particular, EPA finds in an analysis of “socially vulnerable groups” that people of color are most likely to live in areas that will face the worst climate impacts. Black individuals are 40 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected increases in mortality rates due to climate-driven changes in extreme temperatures. Hispanic and Latino individuals are 43 percent more likely to live in areas with the highest projected labor hour losses in weather-exposed industries. American Indian and Alaska Native individuals are 48 percent more likely to live in areas where the highest percentage of land is projected to be inundated due to sea level rise.4 The connection between redlining and climate vulnerability is clear; they co-exist in a feedback loop that further entrenches racial and economic inequality. In recent years, climate impacts–especially in underserved communities–are leading to ever-increasing annual direct damages,5 disruption to local economies based on agriculture, tourism, and energy,6 and sometimes ultimately emigration7 and loss of tax base,8 effectively bankrupting small towns across the country9 and destabilizing local financial institutions.10 Underserved communities 10 The Wall Street Journal, “Banks Take a Hit from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita,” 2005. https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB112993899645076384 9 The NYTimes, “Climate Change is Bankrupting America’s Small Towns,” September 2021. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/climate/climate-towns-bankruptcy.html 8 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), “Climate Change and Long Term Fiscal Sustainability,” 2021. https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/scoping-paper-on-fiscal-sustainability-and-climate-change.pdf 7 The NYTimes and ProPublica, “The Great Climate Migration,” 2020. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html 6 U.S. Global Change Research Program, “Fourth National Climate Assessment -Volume II: Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States,” 2018. https://nca2018.globalchange.gov 5 NOAA, “Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters,” 2022. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/ 4 EPA, “Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States,” September 2021. ​https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/climate-vulnerability_september-2021_508.pdf 3 Hoffman et al., “The Effects of Historical Housing Policies on Resident Exposure to Intra-Urban Heat: A Study of 108 US Urban Areas,” 2020. https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm 2 See E.g., Redfin News, “A Racist Past, a Flooded Future: Formerly Redlined Areas Have $107 Billion Worth of Homes Facing High Flood Risk–25% More Than Non-Redlined Areas,” 2021. https://www.redfin.com/news/redlining-flood-risk/
tend to be both the most exposed to these damages and least able to access the federal aid resources to recover financially.11 In 2020, the National Advisory Council to FEMA troublingly found that “Many FEMA programs do not consider the principle of equity in financial assistance relief…Through the entire disaster cycle, communities that have been underserved stay underserved, and thereby suffer needlessly and unjustly.” In fact, research has shown that “holding disaster costs constant, the more [FEMA] money a county receives, the more whites’ wealth tends to grow, and the more blacks’ wealth tends to decline, all else equal. In other words, how federal assistance is currently administered seems to be exacerbating rather than ameliorating wealth inequalities that unfold after costly natural hazards.”12 As the stability of local banks is deeply linked to the economic fortunes of the communities and households that they serve, institutions that provide vital access to financial services for underserved communities face particular challenges due to climate change. Bank supervisors must be on the lookout not only for systemic risks that affect the largest banks and could lead to cascading losses to the deposit insurance fund, but also subsystemic safety and soundness issues that will affect certain geographies, sectors, and bank business models with elevated climate risk, as well as the risk that bank failures may pose to consumers through banking consolidation. Banks are chartered to serve the convenience and needs of their communities, so not only is their financial stability dependent on the economic stability of those communities, banks should be a driving force in ensuring that stability for all members of those communities. Supervision must encourage banks to enhance operational resilience and expand physical access to banking in LMI communities and communities of color. The FDIC should use supervision to ensure that banks remain operationally resilient in the face of climate-related disasters and that they offer financial services to underserved communities on an equitable basis. FDIC should extend and tailor its supervisory guidance to smaller institutions. Nearly all of the institutions supervised by the FDIC are smaller banks and savings associations.13 Some are more vulnerable to climate risk than larger banks due to the financial needs they meet and their more limited geographic range and product offerings, and they are also critically important for the financial health of rural and underserved communities. Banks must be prepared for increasingly common and severe disruptions due to climate-related disasters–such as wildfires or hurricanes–and chronic stressors like persistent flooding and extreme heat. Preparations should extend to electrical power, communications systems, and physical resilience of branches, servers, offices, and ATMs. Branch closings in increasingly 13 FDIC, “Supervision Program,” https://www.fdic.gov/about/strategic-plans/strategic/supervision.html 12 FEMA National Advisory Council, “National Advisory Council Report to the FEMA Administrator,” November 2020. https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_nac-report_11-2020.pdf; Howell and Elliott, “As Disaster Costs Rise, So Does Inequality,” Socius, 4 Dec 2018. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2378023118816795 11 Urban Institute, “Improving Disaster Recovery of Low-Income Families.” https://www.urban.org/debates/improving-disaster-recovery-low-income-families
climate vulnerable areas may be avoidable by investing in operational resilience. The FDIC should work in particular with smaller banks to disseminate policies and procedures that have worked to maintain resilience during previous disasters and encourage their implementation. Risk mitigation measures that rely on avoiding or raising rates in climate vulnerable areas will have disparate impacts on LMI communities and communities of color. In an effort to remain safe and sound, it is critical that larger, more diversified banks do not retreat from climate vulnerable communities, but instead find ways to promote climate resilience for their customers and communities. “Bluelining” is a developing practice where financial institutions identify areas as having higher environmental risk and avoid offering loans and banking services, or raise costs in those areas.14 Seemingly risk-based analysis will recreate the same boundaries as previous redlining decisions that create and perpetuate racial and economic inequality. Such practices are particularly harmful to underserved communities that often lack ready access to credit at fair rates to rebuild. The FDIC draft principles contain only a brief mention of the potential fair lending risk that may be associated with these harmful mitigation practices under the category of legal/compliance risk. To avoid disparate impacts of the guidance, FDIC must place greater emphasis on fair lending risk–it should be an essential component of all aspects of the climate risk management that banks do–especially given the troubling history of discriminatory policies and practices that have led to climate vulnerability for underserved communities. As part of the guidance, FDIC should provide examples of climate risk mitigation strategies that pose potential fair lending risk exposure for banks, including with respect to potential revised CRA guidelines which penalize bank investments that exacerbate racialized climate harms.15 Further, FDIC should collect data to determine how prevalent climate-induced curtailing of financial services has become for LMI communities and communities of color. As part of this guidance, it should also require that banks identify, measure, monitor, and address potential and occurring disproportionate impacts on communities of color and LMI communities. Banks should have a system for tracking their actions to avoid or address disproportionate impacts and documenting their progress on addressing those impacts. FDIC should also provide clear supervisory expectations and work with banks to manage climate-related risks in ways that do not create disparate impact on underserved communities. There are methods available that serve the same purpose without discriminatory effect. For instance, the FDIC could encourage banks to invest more in other resilience measures, such as divesting from assets exposed to a high degree of transition risk, or provide more low-cost funding for climate mitigation and adaptation measures in vulnerable communities. This guidance should be consistent with expected CRA reform that expands the definition to “community development” to include climate resilience and green investments. 15 Cite CRA proposal 14 Abraham Lustgarten, “How the Climate Crisis Will Shape Migration in America,” The NYTimes, 15 Sept 2021.
The FDIC should work also with other government agencies to examine banks’ needs and other federal climate and disaster resilience resources to deal with climate risk that can be deployed to lessen climate vulnerability and deter banks retreating from the communities and households that most need access to financial services to prepare for and recover from climate-related disasters. Special attention and resources should be provided to small CDFIs with strong track records of serving underserved communities, MDIs, and institutions that cannot easily diversify. The FDIC should encourage safe and fair lending strategies to improve the climate resilience of communities and households the institutions it regulates serve, and discourage predatory products marketed with a “green” label. Acceptable climate-risk mitigation can include lending strategies that promote climate resilience, including the development of climate resilient affordable housing, schools, and businesses; clean electricity projects and microgrids; nature-based protective infrastructure (“green infrastructure”); building decarbonization, which includes holistic home weatherization and health interventions; electric public transit and electric vehicle charging infrastructure; and lending to green small businesses and corporations with legitimate decarbonization transition strategies. For smaller community-based banks, investments in weatherization and climate resilience for local businesses can improve the financial health of the community and promote safety and soundness. Climate-risk mitigation measures generally should be developed in a way that ensures accessibility and affordability in LMI communities and communities of color, and which promotes bonafide wealth building opportunities in these communities. Unfortunately, many community banks have noted that the novelty of these climate-resilient asset classes creates regulatory uncertainty, chilling lending. The FDIC should prioritize providing guidance on green lending for underserved communities, which will help small banks deploy capital in socially productive ways. To do this, the FDIC can survey what has worked for smaller banks, or even green banks, who have successfully underwritten such loans, and transmit the specific policies and procedures that could be put in place to underwrite green loans in novel markets. Such guidance will provide confidence to smaller banks in moving forward on these kinds of loans. At the same time, the guidance should recognize where “green” financial products have not been good for consumers, and steer banks away from those products. For example, residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loans offer the often over-inflated promise of electricity bill savings through energy efficiency or renewable energy upgrades, but most programs do not fully assess the borrower's ability to repay. The borrower’s home serves as collateral for PACE financing with payments collected through the local property tax system. Failure to pay can leave the homeowner vulnerable to tax foreclosure. And as with the subprime lending abuses that led to the financial crisis of a decade ago, residential PACE loans frequently target the most economically vulnerable borrowers–low-income families, the elderly, and borrowers of color–many of whom may be eligible for grants or low cost loans to address energy efficiency and for whom PACE loans may be an unaffordable and risky product. Residential
PACE lending has become an urgent problem in low-income communities and communities of color where the product is actively sold using aggressive sales tactics and homeowners are often pressured to sign up without an actual assessment of home needs or suitability. The FDIC must caution banks away from propagating this product, as well as others like it. The FDIC should also ensure that any novel approaches to housing finance intended to promote energy efficiency retrofits and upgrades do not feature the unintended consequences of assumed savings or increased property values and, as a result, place consumers in loans they cannot afford or loans that are not justified by the subsequent energy savings. We thank the FDIC for moving forward with supervisory guidance to mitigate climate risk within the banking system, and we urge your consideration of fair lending implications and incorporation of appropriate equity safeguards within the supervision and examination process.

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street, NW  Washington, DC  20429    Re: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions; RIN 3064-ZA32  Dear Sir:     The American Bankers Association1 appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on the  Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (“the Principles”) published for comment by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC). The Principles are intended to improve banks’ identification and  management of climate-related financial risks at banks with $100 billion in assets and above.  The Principles call for enhanced governance, strategic planning, risk management, oversight, and  data reporting practices for climate-related financial risks.   ABA and its members understand that climate change has implications for banks, their  counterparties and the communities banks serve.2 Overall, we support the Principles as a guide  for larger institutions, which are currently working to better understand their climate-related risks  and communicate the information and actions to regulators, investors and other stakeholders. We  reiterate the concerns and comments discussed in response to the BCBS and OCC’s proposed  principles,3 and emphasize the need for a tailored, principles-based approach until the data and  methodologies for understanding climate-related financial risk are more fully developed.                                                               1 The American Bankers Association is the voice of the nation’s $24 trillion banking industry, which is composed of  small, regional and large banks that together employ more than 2 million people, safeguard $19.9 trillion in  deposits and extend nearly $11.4 trillion in loans.    2 ABA has developed a set of principles guiding our advocacy on these issues:  https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/climate-change-and-banking   3 ABA comment letter to the OCC https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/clclimateocc20220214    ABA comment letter to the BCBS https://www.aba.com/advocacy/policy-analysis/clbcbs20220214   
    2    The largest banks are currently making significant investments in staffing, training, systems,  modeling and data collection to better assess and monitor their climate-related risks. As the  FDIC is aware, however, defining and quantifying climate change-related impacts on traditional  bank risks is a relatively new and complex process, with the assumptions backing the analyses  dependent on a vast number of policy choices and outcomes, over timeframes that extend far  beyond those used to assess traditional banking risks.   Given these uncertainties, and to accommodate what will likely be significant changes to the  practice of climate-related financial risk identification, we urge the FDIC to continue to take a  principles-based approach that is flexible and iterative—and that allows banks to assess the risks  they identify as the most material to their unique circumstances. Moreover, we urge the FDIC  not to expand the scope of the guidance to mid-size and community banks until more robust data  is available, and the climate-related financial risks and opportunities are better understood. This  does not mean that these risks are unmitigated, rather, that banks and other corporations are  being asked to identify and isolate new variables and concepts, such as exposure to transition  risks. Banks are well-practiced in adapting to and managing change in the business environment  and consumer and market preferences. Climate-related financial risks are naturally embedded  into this process through the dynamic market, economic, and counterparty data that are the  backbone of robust risk management. As the policy goals, definitions, and methodologies behind  climate-related financial risk identification evolve, banks of all sizes will continue to apply  traditional credit and financial risk tolerances and parameters to their balance sheets to manage  their risks and support the customers and communities they serve.   Prescriptive guidance or regulation based on today’s climate –related financial risk  assumptions would be premature   The largest banks are conducting climate specific qualitative assessments, developing internal  models, and incorporating forward-looking, climate-related considerations into strategy and new  business assessment. As a practical matter, however, the nascent stage of climate-related risk  assessment means that banks are in the earliest stages of exploring how to refine and adapt their  management of climate-related financial risks.   The risk management frameworks, systems, and metrics the largest banks use to manage  traditional bank risk are effective, well established, backed by deep and robust market and  economic data, and understood by bank boards and management, bank counterparties, investors,  supervisors, and other stakeholders. Climate-related financial risk assessment is not nearly as  well understood or developed. For example, there is an absence of robust market data related to  climate-related financial risk,a lack of standardized definitions surrounding what is meant by  climate-related risk, and limited information about how climate-related risk interacts with  traditional financial risks. For example, there is little information as yet on the risk of losses,  posed by climate change, the probability of default or loss given default or the making the  modeling necessary to identification extremely difficult. Together, these foundational gaps mean  that the processes, procedures and methodologies surrounding climate-related risk identification  and monitoring are in the earliest stages of development. It would be premature, then, to  implement prescriptive or quantitative based requirements with respect to climate related  financial risk, such as those related to risk limits and appetites.  Any future guidance should not  be so prescriptive as to require changes to existing - or creation of new - credit risk appetite and  lending limits, as a result of climate risk considerations 
    3    ABA believes that any future guidance or regulations should remain open ended with regulators   focused on ensuring that the largest banks are progressing in their capabilities and conducting  internal climate-related risk analysis calibrated to the risks material to their individual business  model. Over the near term, attaching regulatory consequences to climate-related risk exposures  would be premature. Additional regulation based on today’s capabilities could potentially result  in a misallocation of resources.   The FDIC should continue to tailor its climate-related guidance    ABA understands that banks of all sizes must identify, monitor, and manage their risks. We  support and appreciate the FDICs’ assurances that any forthcoming regulation will be tailored to  reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of operations and business  models, and we agree with this approach. As a general matter, banks of differing sizes and  complexity are engaged in different combinations of activities, which in turn present a wide  variety of risk profiles. This is also the case with climate-related financial risks, with the added  challenge of significant uncertainty around definitions, data, and the capacity to build necessary  systems and expertise.   As discussed above, many of the largest institutions are devoting significant resources to better  understand how to assess and integrate climate-related financial risks, while many smaller  institutions are still trying to determine if they have exposure based on current definitions, and if  so, what it may mean for their institution, their customers and their communities. Additionally,  smaller institutions rely on third parties for data and reporting, so they will need additional time  to quantify and assess their climate-related financial risks.   We recommend that the FDIC not apply this guidance to mid-sized and smaller institutions until  climate-related financial risk is more precisely identified and understood, and the methodologies  have evolved. Future supervisory expectations or further regulation will need to be calibrated for  smaller institutions, mitigating any negative impact on their communities.     Climate scenario analysis should be an internal and confidential supervisory process  We appreciate the FDIC’s distinction between “scenario analysis,” and “stress testing.” Scenario  analysis is typically a forward-looking assessment of a potential future state of the world over  time, resulting from a plausible and possibly adverse set of assumed events or sequence of  assumed events. Stress testing typically assesses the potential impacts of transitory shocks to  near-term economic and financial conditions. Stress testing usually has capital planning  implications, and refers to exercises, conducted by the Federal Reserve, that may have regulatory  consequences. “Climate scenario analysis” is a tool used to enhance critical strategic thinking  and inform strategic decision-making to assess business risks and opportunities against a range  of plausible future climate scenarios. To avoid confusion, we recommend that the FDIC provide  further clarity by using the term “climate scenario analysis” to connote an exploratory exercise  for banks’ assessment of the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities over short,  medium, and long-time horizons.   As part of their overall effort to better understand their climate-related financial risks, large  banks are developing climate-related scenario analysis based on their unique systems, risks, and  business models. Through this process, many banks are identifying key data and modeling gaps,  and they are evaluating external providers to find a work around for those identified gaps. We 
    4    recommend that until climate-related risks are better understood, and more market and economic  data is available, climate scenario analysis be performed using banks’ internal models and  processes.   The FDIC should ensure that banks can continue to serve their communities  Banks are a critical source of lending to retail and small business in communities across the  United States. The FDIC, together with the OCC, Federal Reserve and other agencies, should  ensure that any future guidance or regulations related to climate related financial risk allows  banks to continue providing loans and other financial services to the communities and customers  they currently serve.   ABA appreciates the question as to whether or not the banking agencies should, “modify existing  regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act, to  address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged  communities” While we will be submitting a detailed comment letter on the recently issued joint  agency proposal to modernize the Community Re-investment Act, we tentatively support  providing positive CRA consideration for certain loans and investments intended to address the  impacts of climate change, particularly as it relates to low- and moderate-income customers and  communities. We stand ready to work with the banking agencies to ensure that all communities  are supported.  The FDIC must continue to collaborate with the other banking agencies and financial  services regulators   An orderly and efficient progression forward dictates that the FDIC work in close conjunction  with the other U.S. banking and financial agencies and international standard setting bodies to  close data gaps and apply a consistent set of definitions, assumptions and methodologies.  Collaboration will also help avoid unintended consequences and ensure that any rules or  guidance are within the issuing agency’s mandate.  Moreover, to help avoid unintended  consequences, it is critical that the  banking agencies seek frequent public input from banks of all  sizes to ensure supervisory goals and expectations align with current capabilities, are properly  calibrated to the risks, and regulations, do not penalize bank customers or the communities banks  support  ***  We appreciate the FDIC’s use of principles, rather than reliance on more detailed or prescriptive  rules, and encourage the FDIC to continue to use this more flexible and iterative approach. This  will allow banks to adapt risk management to their most material issues and to adjust to the  rapidly evolving climate-risk policy and practice environment.

Sheesley, Assistant  Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429  Attention: Comments—RIN 3064–ZA32  To Whom It May Concern:   The U.S. Impact Investing Alliance (“the Alliance”) writes in support of the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation’s (“FDIC”) draft principles for management of climate-related financial risks for large  financial institutions.     The Alliance is an organization committed to catalyzing the growth of impact investing in the United  States. We define impact investing broadly to include those investments that create financial returns  alongside measurable and positive social, economic or environmental impact across asset classes.  Members of our boards and councils include high-net-worth individual and institutional investors  collectively owning hundreds of billions of dollars of invested assets, in addition to asset and fund  managers collectively managing over one trillion dollars in assets.   Climate change poses significant and systemic risks to financial stability and the capital markets, and  there is growing evidence that failing to act on climate change will have profound negative  consequences for the U.S. economy.1 Investors and global stakeholders are increasingly calling on  financial institutions to measure and manage their exposures to both physical and transition risks.2 The  FDIC’s set of principles will help provide clarity to financial institutions seeking to do so, and they  represent a clear extension of the FDIC’s founding mission to maintain stability and public confidence in  our national financial system.  In particular, the Alliance is supportive of the FDIC’s consideration within the principles of climate- related financial risks in the context of low- to moderate-income (“LMI”) communities.

Related to the Community Reinvestment Act  (“CRA”) in particular, the Alliance believes banking regulators should consider whether a bank’s  investments and efforts to mitigate negative climate-related impacts on LMI communities should be  factored into the institution’s CRA rating. We look forward to exploring this issue further in our  comments to the FDIC responding to the joint proposed regulations alongside the Federal Reserve Board  of Governors (“Federal Reserve”) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).4  The Alliance would also emphasize the importance of the included guidance directing boards and  management of financial institutions to ensure their climate-related public statements or commitments  align with internal strategies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) recently proposed  enhanced disclosures on climate-related risks for U.S.-listed companies,5 including specific disclosures  related to climate-related targets and goals. The FDIC should ensure banks are held to the same  transparency standard for the benefit of investors and customers regarding how they are executing and  living up to these commitments, such as net-zero carbon emissions pledges, that could impact financial  stability over the long term.   Furthermore, the FDIC should consider how to align with efforts across federal agencies related to  mandated, public reporting of climate-related financial risk, including the SEC’s proposed climate  disclosures for U.S.-listed companies.   Addressing the financial impacts of climate change will require a cohesive, coordinated approach to  measuring, managing and mitigating the harmful effects of climate change on American companies,  investors, workers, consumers and communities.

Sheesley Assistant Executive Secretary Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 550 17th Street NW Washington, DC 20429 RE: FDIC Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions Attention: Docket ID FDIC-2022-07065; RIN 3064-ZA32 To whom it may concern, Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund (AFREF) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions. We support this important step toward addressing climate-related risk in the banking system, and encourage FDIC to strengthen and finalize the guidance as soon as possible. In addition to this submission, AFREF has joined two other comments submitted to the FDIC that focus on aligning banks’ climate commitments with internal strategies and governance, and fair lending, racial justice, and community development implications of the guidance. In this comment, we expand on the views of AFREF with respect to other topics and questions posed by the request for comment. In response to Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model, should inform financial institutions' adoption of these principles? The FDIC draft notes that “all financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial risks.” We agree, and encourage FDIC, in collaboration with other banking regulators, to extend and tailor their supervisory guidance to banks of all sizes, including smaller institutions which may be more vulnerable to climate risk than larger banks due to the financial needs they meet and their more limited geographic range and product offerings. It is also critical that supervisory expectations encourage enhanced operational resilience to climate risks–especially for smaller institutions that provide vital banking services to underserved communities during and following disasters and other times of acute need–and that risk mitigation strategies broadly remedy rather than exacerbate economic burdens on
lower income communities and communities of color. Tailored guidance based on location and business model should also be a component of FDIC’s supervisory and examinations process. In response to Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with financial institutions to understand those challenges? In recent years, many of the largest U.S. banks have developed net zero emissions commitments1 in recognition of the growing physical and transition risk that financed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pose to their businesses, including through the traditional channels of credit risk, market risk, litigation risk, and reputational risk.2 The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)–now in use by over 200 financial institutions worldwide–offers a reliable accounting framework for banks and other financial institutions to calculate and disclose their financed emissions. Where data gaps exist, banks may still need more comprehensive, standardized information from operational firms to fully assess financed emissions and other climate risks on their balance sheets. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s climate disclosure rulemaking3 is a step in the right direction to make climate risk information more standardized, credible, decision-useful, and freely available to banks, investors, and other market participants. FDIC should work with banks to integrate this new information into their risk management processes and strategies as it becomes available. Further, the FDIC draft notes that “climate-related financial risks can transmit to a significant number of financial institutions and raise financial stability concerns.” As financed GHG emissions are a critical driver of both micro- and macroprudential climate-related risk, the FDIC should make clear that having a credible transition plan and reporting on progress is a crucial part of a bank’s risk management system. The FDIC should work with banks to develop credible climate strategies and ensure that their public climate commitments are fully aligned with their internal risk management, strategy, and governance. In response to Question 8: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do financial institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Market Risk Advisory Committee recommended in 2020 that “CFTC should coordinate with other regulators to support the 3 “SEC Proposes Rules to Enhance and Standardize Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,” 21 Mar 2022. https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46 2 NGO Letter to US Banking Regulators, “Bank Supervision and Climate Risk,” Sept 2021. https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Supervision-and-Climate-Risk-Documents.pdf 1 “Big Banks Are Making Big Climate Promises. 3 Ways to Tell Who Will Deliver,” Forbes, 20 Jan 2022, https://www.forbes.com/sites/edfenergyexchange/2022/01/20/3-climate-actions-banks-must-take-to-fast-tr ack-net-zero-in-2022/?sh=5b1977595ff8
development of a robust ecosystem of climate-related risk management products.”4 Products such as catastrophe bonds, weather derivatives, carbon offsets, and water futures may well be effective for risk transfer and hedging for individual financial institutions, but we are concerned that they may contribute to, rather than ameliorate, systemic climate risk that harms the financial system, consumers, and the broader economy.5 In dealing with climate risk–which poses a broad and deep emerging threat to financial stability and the financial health of communities and households across the country–risk transfer cannot be a substitute for true systemic risk mitigation.6 Insurers regularly use catastrophe bonds and reinsurance contracts to transfer physical climate risk to investors or other institutions, all the while investing and insuring the fossil fuel expansion projects that create carbon emissions, worsen climate impacts, and raise the chances of payouts due to climate-driven disasters.7 In 2020, a water futures market emerged on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange based on the availability of water rights in California, where droughts have become common and are expected to worsen as climate change unfolds.8 A December 2021 petition called for the suspension of the market, led by Food & Water Watch, a nonprofit, and signed by an additional 138 other organizations including AFREF.9 The water futures market may have negative effects on the real economy, discouraging water efficiency activities, and driving up prices for water–an essential natural resource and public need. Water is an unacceptable target for financial speculation. Carbon offsets, credits, and derivative products are commonly invoked within net zero transition plans, but credibility problems persist, and reliance on these products may delay emissions reduction investments and progress that is critically needed for systemic risk mitigation. A recent report from the New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch analyzed corporate net zero transition plans for 25 companies and found that “Companies’ plans to offset or ‘neutralise’ their emissions are especially contentious.”10 10 New Climate Institute and Carbon Market Watch, Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2022, https://carbonmarketwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CMW_CCRM2022_v08_FinalStretch2.pdf 9 Food and Water Watch, “More than 100 Groups Call on CFTC To Shut Down Dangerous ‘Water Futures’ Market,” Dec 2021. https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2021/12/20/more-than-100-groups-call-on-cftc-to-shut-down-dangero us-water-futures-market/ 8 Yale Environment 360, “Wall Street Begins Trading Water Futures as a Commodity,”  Dec 2020. https://e360.yale.edu/digest/wall-street-begins-trading-water-futures-as-a-commodity 7 Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund, Letter to the Federal Insurance Office on the Insurance Sector and Climate-Related Financial Risks RFI, Nov 2021. https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11.15.21-AFREF-comment-to-Treasury-FIO-o n-Insurers-and-Climate-Risk.pdf 6 Financial Stability Oversight Council, “Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” 2021. https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf 5 See E.g., “Wall Street’s Favorite Climate Solution is Mired in Disagreements,” Bloomberg, June 2021. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-02/carbon-offsets-new-100-billion-market-faces-dispu tes-over-trading-rules?sref=f7rH2jWS 4 CFTC, “Managing Climate Risk in the U.S. Financial System,” Sept 2020. https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8234-20
Further, derivatives may help individual institutions hedge climate change risks in the short-term, but climate change is not a short-term challenge. Risks related to climate change will only increase over the coming decades, and banks should therefore be encouraged to adopt long-term risk mitigation strategies that don’t depend on the availability of complex financial products and markets. The FDIC should research the use and impacts across all of these hedging products in collaboration with the CFTC, the other banking regulators, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to better understand the potential microprudential and macroprudential implications. The FDIC should provide guidance to ensure that bank risk mitigation strategies do not contribute to untenable systemic risk or worsening of the climate crisis and the resultant exacerbated safety and soundness concerns. In response to Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Should the agencies modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act, to address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged communities? The FDIC must carefully consider the potential impacts of climate supervisory guidance on racial, economic, environmental, and climate justice, and how these expectations will interact with fair lending principles and regulation and consumer financial protections. Prudential climate financial regulation is vital, and it must not result in additional burdens on vulnerable communities and households, the very consumers who are most at risk from climate impacts. To this end, it is critical that the FDIC expand its climate risk guidance to all banks in a way that recognizes the important role credit and banking services should play in helping vulnerable communities in building resilience to climate disasters and benefiting economically and through collateral benefits through climate mitigation. Such guidance should include how banks can and should maintain the operational resilience of the critical services they provide. It should also encourage both large and small banks to support community investment in adaptation instead of withdrawing credit, to finance green investment, and to protect consumers from unsafe “green” financial products that lack adequate consumer protections and/or do not deliver purported climate benefits. “19 of the 25 companies assessed already know that they will rely on offsetting for their future pledges, and only one company plans explicitly without offsets (see Figure S3). At least two-thirds of these companies rely on carbon dioxide removals from forestry and other biological-related carbon sequestration (nature-based solutions) to claim that their emissions in the future are offset, i.e. that the impact to the climate is the same as if the emissions were never released in the first place. But these approaches are unsuitable for individual offsetting claims, because biological carbon storage can be reversed (e.g. when forests are cut and burned) and because there is a global requirement to reduce emissions and increase carbon storage, not one or the other. Claims of carbon neutrality today are often misleading; we identified significant credibility problems with all of the carbon neutrality claims form the companies assessed in this report, due to a combination of limited emissions coverage, inconsistent messaging, or procurement of low-quality carbon credits.”
The FDIC must also modify existing regulations and guidance associated with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to address the impact climate-related financial risks have on LMI and communities of color. These supervisory principles should be harmonized with anticipated CRA revisions that expand the definition to “community development” to include climate resilience and green investments, and that penalize bank investments that exacerbate racialized climate harms. AFREF’s full views on the fair lending, racial and economic justice, and community development implications of these supervisory guidance principles can be found in the coalition comment submitted on June 2, 2022 with 13 undersigned organizations. In response to Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial institutions currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models? The FDIC guidance should encourage banks to obtain additional information from their borrowers and other counterparties, including: ● Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions data; ● Information on planned capital expenditures on sustainable products and initiatives, and their likely impact on company emissions, energy and natural resource use, as well as transition plans; ● Geolocational information of all critical borrower infrastructure; ● Borrower climate disclosures prepared using the TCFD framework (banks should encourage borrowers to disclose this information using the TCFD framework to ensure that climate-relevant data is comparable across industries and geographies); and ● Information about corporate impacts and track record on environmental justice, Indigenous rights, land use, natural resources, public health, local economies, and other community-level impacts. In response to Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks? We recommend that reporting requirements should be expanded to include a series of line items to each applicable schedule about loans for fossil fuel exploration, production and fossil electricity generation, as well as securities backed by these assets and derivatives referencing them. As with real estate lending on the current call reports, these loans should be broken out by duration, with detailed information about allowances for losses on loans with terms of three or more years, which are particularly exposed to transition risk. The call reports should also add additional information about exposure of existing loan types to physical risks, such as separate line items for loans and asset-backed securities secured by real estate in flood zones or high wildfire risk areas.
In response to Questions 12 and 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises? It’s critical that the FDIC develop climate scenarios–in coordination with the other banking regulators and the FSOC–and conduct system-wide scenario analysis exercises to assess the breadth and depth of climate risk within the banking system, identify areas of risk concentration, and inform risk management strategies for individual financial institutions and for microprudential and macroprudential regulatory interventions. These scenarios should include ambitious energy transition scenarios like the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario,11 incorporate best practices as developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and rigorous central bank exercises,12 and include orderly and disorderly transitions coinciding with a broad range of extreme but plausible outcomes with respect to global emissions, climate sensitivity, tipping points, and speed of the energy transition. These exercises should be used to determine breaking points for bank solvency, so models should be analytical, not discrete, to allow for robust assessment of the risk landscape across many parameters and for a full range of extreme but plausible circumstances. The FDIC should publish climate scenario models and tools and work with supervised banks to run their own scenario analysis exercises and stress tests, and to identify risks and mitigate them in a safe and orderly manner before physical impacts and transition shocks become unmanageable. In developing climate scenarios and guidelines for scenario analysis exercises and stress testing, FDIC should keep the following principles in mind. 1) Banks cannot rely on historical data to measure forward looking physical risk from climate change. Over the past four decades, the intensity, frequency and economic impacts of many types of climate disasters have increased nonlinearly,13 and these effects are expected to continue.14 Using historical data–even looking at the most severe events of the past–does not capture the severity of future storms, which will likely be far more severe and costly. 14 Swiss Re Institute, “World economy set to lose up to 18% GDP from climate change if no action taken, reveals Swiss Re Institute’s stress-test analysis,” 22 Apr 2021. https://www.swissre.com/media/news-releases/nr-20210422-economics-of-climate-change-risks.html 13 NOAA, “United States Billion-Dollar Disaster Events 1980-2021 (CPI-Adjusted),” https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/time-series 12 ECB, “ ECB economy-wide climate stress test: Methodology and results,” Sept 2021. https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op281~05a7735b1c.en.pdf 11 ​IEA, “Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector,” May 2021. https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050
2) Physical and transition losses will likely be correlated and scenario analysis needs to incorporate shocks in series and in parallel, not as discrete events. Acute physical damages from climate disasters, chronic losses of productivity due to physical changes, transition shocks, and chronic transition losses and gradual write-offs of stranded assets will occur in parallel, in series, and interdependently. The increased frequency of climate disasters will likely deteriorate the financial resilience of banks and the communities they serve, and whether households and businesses will be able to continually absorb consistently increasing climate-related losses and remain solvent must be carefully investigated. 3) Scenario analysis must explore network effects within the financial sector. The financial sector’s response to climate disasters or transition shocks may include contagion, bank runs, rapid asset repricing, credit deterioration, and other network effects that lead to further financial instability. Modeling that doesn’t include network effects will likely underestimate the threat of climate change to financial stability. We thank the FDIC for moving forward with supervisory guidance to better understand and mitigate climate risk within the banking system, and we encourage you to finalize these principles and begin incorporating them into the examinations process promptly.

Sincerely, Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund","The Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund (AFREF) supports the FDIC's initiative to address climate-related financial risks in large financial institutions and urges the FDIC to strengthen and finalize the guidance. AFREF emphasizes the need for tailored guidance for banks of all sizes, especially smaller institutions vulnerable to climate risks. They advocate for enhanced operational resilience and risk mitigation strategies that do not burden lower-income communities. AFREF highlights challenges banks face in incorporating climate principles, such as data gaps and the need for standardized climate risk information. They stress the importance of credible transition plans and alignment of public climate commitments with internal strategies. AFREF expresses concerns about financial products like catastrophe bonds and carbon offsets, which may exacerbate systemic climate risks. They call for regulatory guidance to ensure risk mitigation strategies do not worsen the climate crisis. AFREF also urges the FDIC to consider the impact of climate risks on disadvantaged communities and modify regulations like the Community Reinvestment Act to support climate resilience. They recommend expanding reporting requirements and conducting comprehensive scenario analyses to assess climate risks within the banking system."

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street, NW   Washington, DC 204429     RE: Statement of Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions: Comment Request (RIN 3064-ZA32)     On behalf of the Nebraska Bankers Association (NBA), I appreciate the opportunity to comment  on the Statement of Principles for Climate–Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions. The NBA is a trade association representing 161 of the 170 commercial  banks and savings institutions in the state of Nebraska.    While we are aware that the proposed Statement of Principles are not to apply to banks with  less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, we are submitting comments because the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has suggested that this is the first iteration of  guidelines that could ultimately apply to all FDIC-insured banks.    Climate–related financial risk is already incorporated into most banks’ strategic and risk– management frameworks. Banks base business decisions on current and historical market data,  which provides information on the level of risk associated with a transaction. Climate–related  financial risks are already embedded into the risk identification and management process  employed by banks through existing policies and procedures. A bank’s lending practices and  management of concentrations in its lending portfolio address the physical and transitional risks  of climate change.     Banks in Nebraska have had experience with managing loans secured by property in  floodplains and have factored the impact of natural disasters such as tornadoes and floods  which have impacted various parts of our state into their risk management policies. We  encourage the FDIC to retain flexible supervisory expectations. The principles adopted should  allow for significant modification as events occur, as the practice and process of climate risk  identification develops, and the risks associated with climate change become more apparent  and clearly defined.     The NBA appreciates the FDIC’s recognition that the draft principles would impose significant  burdens if applied to smaller banks. As a result, the FDIC should not expand the scope of the  draft principles. If the FDIC ultimately determines that climate–related risk management  guidance is necessary for all FDIC banks, the principles should not be extended to mid–sized  and smaller banks until climate risk is better quantified and understood and should be tailored in  such a fashion to avoid unnecessary operational burdens for these smaller institutions. 
    James P. Sheesley  June 2, 2022  Page 2      While important for the Agency to provide a framework for the safe and sound management of  exposure to climate–related financial risks, it is important to ensure that the lending needs of  communities are supported, and that individuals and businesses continue to have access to  needed financial services.     Banks throughout the state of Nebraska play an essential role in promoting the vitality of the  communities in which they are located and the areas which they serve by providing financing to  individuals and businesses. The imposition of prescriptive regulatory requirements on climate– related risk by prudential regulators could cause economic disruption and harm. At the end of  the day, bank business decisions should be shaped by legitimate safety and soundness  concerns and not by regulatory suasion.    We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed principles and thank you for your  consideration of our comments.    Very Truly Yours,   Richard J.

And, regardless of that matter; we are concerned and oppose the use of the banking industry as the law enforcement ""branch"" ofthe government to choke off or reduce the viability of industries that any branch of the government deems dangerous to a properly invoked policy: However; despite the failure of Congress to take a position on the use of banks in the climate control policy issues, it is necessary for us to comment on and oppose the current proposal: The FDIC' $ statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management purports to apply only to financial institutions with total consolidated assets $100 billion or more. However, from our member bank'$ previous experience with such regulations (i.e. Dodd-Frank), we have a valid concern that smaller banks (and, ultimately, all banks) will be impacted by these rules directly or indirectly. This may occur through gradual seeping of climate-related expectations into the mindset of regulators as a ""best practice"" ortheymay create a perception by communities, regulators or even banks themselves that the industries considered ""climate risks' are somehow unsound customers or investments for all banks: The seepage of these perceptions into the banking decisions of experienced banking professionals could result in unfounded financial risks, physical risks, and/or transition risks, resulting in criticisms or citations relating to bank customers and transactions which have already been evaluated by bank The KBA has experience in seeing regulator ""assignment of 'risk"" replacing an experienced banker's and the result was                                            0 unsupported, but of course won in the end_ Aregulator should not (consciously or subconsciously) create a risk where none exists and should not replace the legal, safe and sound decisions made by banks with an artificial creation of a policy that discriminates against a lawful industry: That has been tried before by the government and failed woefully (Operate Choke Point).

Mr. James Sheesley Page 2 June 2, 2022 An additional concern is the potential cost involved. When this proposal, if passed, seeps down to smaller banks the result will not only be the potential loss valued customers bit also the unreasonable and unnecessary expense of complex models, governance requirements, and specialized expertise-       which can almost certainly only be completed as a result of third-party expertise: How much data will our banks be required to collect and obtain from their customers to satisfy the policy regulations of climate control? How many community banks and their small businesses will this cost weaken and destroy? What if the risk is false, but the data requested is what creates the risk to the customer, by imposing burdensome expenses? Is this really a benefit to the banking system or a short cut to a policy that should be implemented by Congress directly against the industries it wishes to restrict? Banks know that every customer comes with risks. Every bank is designed to evaluate and weigh those risks.  The means of weighing those risk is created in such a way that more evaluation is made where the risk is greater. The FDIC should, rather than passing climate policy regulations, continue to focus on its practice of evaluating a bank's ability to consider risks in a sound manner, without focusing on a single industry: The FDIC should PROTECT the industry against the improper use of the industry's access to data and the industry'$ access to the banking system, which is necessary to every business in the US. We urge you to consider this regulation with an eye towards the job that banks and regulators already do well and work together with the banking industry to ensure that banks are managing and weighing risks with safety and soundness in mind: We urge you to reject this proposal andkeepourbanking industry strong for communities, businesses and for banking, which the FDIC has regulated since 1933.","The Kentucky Bankers Association (KBA), representing 147 member banks, opposes the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management rules for large financial institutions.

2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-026,"1          June 2, 2022    James P. Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention: Comments—RIN 3064-ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429      Re:  Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions  (RIN 3064-ZA32)  Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:    Better Markets1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft principles captioned  above (“proposed principles”),2 issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”),  regarding the principles it has outlined for both banks and supervisors to consider in the  management and supervision of climate-related financial risks (“climate risks”).      Better Markets applauds the publication of these principles as an important step in  addressing climate risks, which can have serious effects on the safety and soundness of banks as  well as overall financial stability. Considering the broad range of risks that climate change can  pose, we welcome the FDIC’s approach of largely integrating climate risks into existing risk  management principles with some additions that capture unique aspects of climate risks. In  particular, the additions unique to climate risks are: the use of scenario analysis to identify and  size risks, the consideration of longer time horizons, and the recognition that climate risks and  their management are an evolving process. This is similar to the approaches taken by the Office  of the Comptroller of the Currency3 and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision4 in the  draft principles they each published late last year.      1 Better Markets is a non-profit, non-partisan, and independent organization founded in the wake of the 2008  financial crisis to promote the public interest in the financial markets, support the financial reform of Wall Street,  and make our financial system work for all Americans again. Better Markets works with allies— including many in  finance—to promote pro-market, pro-business, and pro-growth policies that help build a stronger, safer financial  system, one that protects and promotes Americans’ jobs, savings, retirements, and more.  2 87 Fed. Reg. 19507  3 Available at https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62a.pdf  4 Available at https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d530.htm 
    2      We urge the FDIC to finalize these principles with some enhancements as discussed  below and to fully incorporate them into the supervisory assessment process. First, considering  the evolving nature of climate risks and the current absence of mandated measurements or  metrics, and the development of so-called best practices being in early stages, the FDIC should  encourage banking institutions to look to available internationally agreed-upon metrics and best  practices for use as a benchmark to, or even direct use in, their own internally developed risk  management practices. This includes data collection and metrics, risk measurement, risk  management thresholds, modeling, and reporting. It also includes scenario analysis, for which  the principles similarly should include the promotion of banking institutions’ use of  internationally agreed-upon scenarios and scientific projections to ensure plausibility and a  minimum level of severity of their own scenarios.     Second, while issuing principles-based guidance is a necessary step in including climate  risks in the supervisory assessment process, given actions taken in the recent past, guidance  alone is unlikely to suffice to prompt banks to adopt suitable practices to address climate risks.   Indeed, a rule proposed5 by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial  Protection (“the Agencies”) in 2020 and adopted by the FDIC in March of last year6 seriously  undermined supervisors’ effectiveness by limiting the role of supervisory guidance in issuing  supervisory findings and by extension informing supervisory ratings. As such, we urge the FDIC  to work with the other regulatory agencies to rescind this rule to better ensure that guidance can  achieve its intended effect of getting banks to develop and use better practices with respect to  managing the risks from climate change.     The Proposed Principles Take the Appropriate Approach of Largely Integrating Climate  Risks into Existing Risk Management Principles    Banks themselves are the “first line” in identifying, sizing, and managing risks, and so it  is necessary for banks to ensure banks have strong and robust risk management and governance  processes in place. It is the responsibility of prudential regulators to assess banks’ processes and  hold banks accountable when they are not effective. Put another way, it is the responsibility of  banks to design and execute processes that are necessary to effectively manage their risks on a  day-to-day basis. The responsibility of prudential regulators is to assess the risk management and  governance processes at banks and to take supervisory actions to require banks to fix weaknesses  in those processes that are identified through supervisory assessments.        Climate risks have been recognized in the U.S. and internationally as risks that pose a  threat to the safety and soundness of banks as well as overall financial stability. Numerous global  regulatory authorities and organizations have made this recognition – the central banks of Japan,  the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and others as well as  inter-agency and international bodies such as the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council, the  Bank for International Settlements, and the Financial Stability Board. As a broadly recognized  and clearly material risk, climate risks must be a part of banks’ risk management and governance  practices and assessing those must be part of the supervisory assessment processes of bank    5 85 Fed. Reg. 70512  6 86 Fed. Reg. 12079 
    3    regulatory authorities. An integral part of that incorporation is including climate risks in  supervisory guidance. More important still is including it in supervisors’ assessment criteria that  feeds into the final supervisory ratings.       Principles-based guidance does not explicitly outline all aspects of supervisory  expectations, and so the principles themselves must be well-founded and specific enough to  make the intention of the expectation clear and to promote safe and sound practices, but also  general enough to allow for evolution and innovation in the development of current best  practices. The proposed principles largely achieve this goal by integrating climate risks into the  existing principles framework for the risk management and governance of more “traditional”  risks – such as credit, market or operational risks – as a starting point and adding components to  the principles to capture certain aspects that are unique to climate risks.     Indeed, nearly all the proposed principles for climate risks align one-for-one with those of  traditional risks. This is sensible and appropriate because climate risks are a risk to safety and  soundness just as with more traditional risks and can manifest as more traditional risks. For  example, changes in weather patterns could significantly decrease the output of farmland that  collateralizes a loan, thereby harming the farmland’s income and its inherent value. This would  have the effect of increasing both the probability of default on the loan and the loss given default.     Importantly, the proposed principles focus on the governance of climate risks and the  responsibility of boards of directors and senior management. Senior management is responsible  for the day-to-day management of all risks to a bank, and boards of directors are ultimately  responsible for overseeing the risk management and governance processes as well as holding  senior management accountable for ensuring sufficient and effective risk management and  governance processes. Both parties must have sufficient knowledge and understanding of climate  risks to fulfill those responsibilities. Key to the proposed principles around governance is the  emphasis on a bank ensuring that their board and senior management has sufficient knowledge  and understanding of climate risks and the impact on a bank’s strategic direction, business  model, and risk appetite. Considering the evolving nature of climate risks and that they are likely  new and less understood risks to boards and senior management, without this emphasis there  may be an incentive to pass on responsibility of the management of climate risks to lower-level  employees and claim ignorance.     In this regard, the principles also sensibly discuss the assignment of climate risks by  board members and senior management to specific members and committees. This targeted  assignment can help ensure that climate risks are being managed and that assigned parties have  the necessary knowledge and understanding and can be held accountable for any issues that  arise. Additionally, with clearly defined responsibilities, identified risks can be escalated more  easily and efficiently and understood by each responsible party along the chain of escalation.     The measurement of climate risks is appropriately a central theme throughout the  principles. Measurement and analysis of risks are foundational to their identification, sizing,  management, and mitigation. In the spirit of largely treating climate risks similar to other more  traditional risks, the principles reasonably promote the measurement and tracking of climate  risks just as with other risks through risk management processes such as: data aggregation; 
    4    qualitative or quantitative metrics or indicators to assess, monitor, and report climate risks;  materiality thresholds; key risk indicators that align with their regular monitoring and escalation  arrangements; and internal risk limits for the various types of material climate risks. However,  the language around data and measurement should be more instructive, as discussed in more  detail below.    Outside of the more standard risk management principles, the FDIC has made some  welcome additions. The FDIC recognizes the key point that risks arising from climate change are  as evolving as climate change itself, a point that defines a major distinguishing factor of climate  risks and one that is the basis for two additions specific to climate risks that are beyond existing  risk management principles. First, the FDIC recognizes climate risks can materialize over longer  time horizons as compared to more traditional risks and that banks must consider this in their  management of climate risks. This is true for both physical and transition risks. Such recognition  is necessary for climate risks to be properly considered and managed and encourages banks to  think about how the risks will evolve over time and take or plan for actions accordingly. Second,  the FDIC specifically promotes the use of scenario analysis as a critical tool for sizing and  identifying climate risks. Scenario analysis is widely recognized as an important tool for  assessing evolving risks that can take many different paths over varying time horizons. These  additions will promote banks to be both nimble and forward-looking, necessary aspects of  managing climate risks.    Additionally, the FDIC has sensibly recognized that many banks have made significant  public commitments regarding modifying their business practices to facilitate the transition to a  low-carbon economy and that these commitments should align with their internal climate risk  management practices, such as internal risk limits. Indeed, if there is no alignment, supervisors  and the public are left to wonder if the commitments are valid and, by extension, if banks are  effectively managing their risk.     Finally, it is important that the FDIC has included the consideration of potential  disproportionate impacts on low-to-moderate income and other disadvantaged households and  communities. These communities do indeed experience disproportionate effects from the fallout  of more traditional risks, as they did during and after the 2008 global financial crisis. Not only  could a similar impact on these communities result from climate risks but there are other impacts  that could also result from climate risks, such as the closing of branches due to weather related  events. More directly, it has been shown that climate shocks and stresses disproportionately  impact low-income communities and economically marginalized communities of color.7     Measurement is the Linchpin to Effective Risk Management, and So the Principles Should  Promote Minimum Standards for Measurement of Climate risks    Being able to measure climate risks and exposures is fundamental to almost all categories  of principles in the proposal – capital and liquidity adequacy, the risk management process,    7 Elizabeth Mattiuzzi and Eileen Hodge, Climate risks Faced by Low and Moderate-Income Communities and  Communities of Color: Survey Results (December 2021), Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,  https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/climate-related-risks-faced-by-low-and-moderate-income- communities-and-communities-of-color-survey-results.pdf. 
    5    management monitoring and reporting, and the comprehensive management of credit, market,  liquidity, operational, and other risks. The guidance principles appropriately cover the  fundamental risk management processes: data aggregation; qualitative or quantitative metrics or  indicators to assess, monitor, and report climate risks; materiality thresholds; key risk indicators  that align with their regular monitoring and escalation arrangements; and internal risk limits for  the various types of material climate risks.    Without sufficient measurement techniques and criteria, banks will not be able to  properly execute on any of these risk management processes. For example, without reliable  measurement techniques, the process of simply determining which climate risks rise to the level  of being material could yield unreliable results or underestimate the amount of material climate  risks to the bank. Similarly, in the process of setting risk limits and monitoring against them, if  data and measurements are unreliable, then not only would the limits be unreliable but so would  the measurements against them, potentially making the entire process a worthless exercise.    So, while it is beneficial that the principles encourage banks to have “effective risk data  aggregation and reporting capabilities” recognize that “data, risk measurement, modeling  methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at a rapid pace,” they do not provide any  guidance as to how banks should be managing the rapidly evolving nature. The continuous pace  and scale of this evolution is unique to climate risks and makes risk management processes more  difficult to establish and more uncertain in their execution. Banks are working to establish their  data collection, risk measurement, modeling, and reporting processes, but an examination of their  publicly disclosed materials around climate risks shows that they are each approaching these  processes in vastly different ways. This unique issue should be addressed in the proposed  principles by promoting the use of or comparison to current climate risk data collection and  measurement “best practices.”     Considering the proposal is intended to support a principles-based approach to addressing  climate risks, it is prudent not to be explicitly instructive as to which data to collect and which  metrics to utilize. Discretion should be left to the banks so that they can collect data and design  metrics and thresholds that are appropriate to the structure and risk profile of their business. That  approach also allows for evolution and innovation within and among banks to create new best  practices or improve upon existing practices.     However, given that climate risk management is in the early stages and that there are not  currently any generally accepted or required climate risk metrics and data collections, banks  should not be left entirely to their own discretion. The supervisory principles should explicitly  promote the use of or comparison to some best practices around data collection and metrics that  are being developed, especially on an international basis. That is, the guidance principles should  state that as banks establish their risk management practices, they should be looking to, for  example, international organizations such as the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on  Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) or the United Nations International Panel on  Climate Change for their recommendations on data collection, climate risk measurements, and  risk management as examples of best practices.     
    6    In fact, many banks are already doing exactly that. All the U.S. Global Systemically  Important Banks are disclosing information that is aligned with the TCFD recommendations,  with plans to increase the amount of such information, and are registered supporters8 of the  TCFD recommendations. The most recent TCFD annual report published by the FSB from  October 20219 shows that over 50% of firms disclosed climate risks and opportunities aligned  with their recommendations. But just because some banks are voluntarily utilizing international  recommendations does not mean there is no need to include the promotion of their use in the  principles as examples of best practices. In fact, it is even more reason to do so.     Not only will the use of or comparison to measurements and data collection from broadly  available best practices be beneficial to banks, but also it would be beneficial to supervisors,  consumers, and market participants. It would help set minimum expectations for banks and  promote broad-based general standards across the industry. Having baseline standards allows for  comparison between banks, provides a consistent set of information for consumers and market  participants, and allows for the aggregation of risks across banks.     As Governor Brainard stated in a speech last year, “Without harmonization of the  definitions and methods underlying these disclosures, it will be challenging to make comparisons  across firms and exposures.”10 Data and risk aggregation support the monitoring of systemic risk  build-up, which is critical to examining the safety and soundness of the system as a whole and is  a key component to assessing overall financial stability within a country and across countries  through collaboration or international supervisory organizations. This is especially important for  climate risks, which are truly global.     Similarly, the Principles Regarding Scenario Analysis Lack the Promotion of Plausible  Scenarios with Minimum Levels of Severity      Similar to data collection and climate risk measurement, the principles leave too much  discretion to banks regarding their scenario analysis. While it is positive that the principles  identify scenario analysis as a key tool for banks to be using in sizing and assessing their climate  risks, the principles fail to include language that promotes the use of plausible scenarios that  have some minimum level of severity.       Again, discretion is an important component of a bank’s internal risk management  practices. For scenario analysis, it allows a bank to design scenarios that are specific and unique  to their business model and risk profile and to create new scenarios that may not have been  imagined by their peers or regulatory authorities. However, allowing too much discretion can  lead to banks ignoring certain important aspects of climate change or designing scenarios that  may not be as severe as generally accepted by the scientific community.       8 See the full list of registered supporting institutions at https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/supporters/.  9 Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, 2021 Status Report (October  2021), https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2021/07/2021-TCFD-Status_Report.pdf.  10 Speech by Governor Lael Brainard At the 2021 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference, Building  Climate Scenario Analysis on the Foundations of Economic Research (October 7, 2021), Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20211007a.htm. 
    7      Therefore, the principles should encourage banks to benchmark their scenarios against  internationally created scenarios and scientific projections, such as those produced by the  Network for Greening the Financial System or the climate projections created by the United  Nations, to ensure some reasonable level of plausibility and severity. By looking to these  scenarios and projections when designing their own scenarios, banks can determine a reasonable  minimum level of severity. In fact, as pointed out in Governor Brainard’s speech, international  regulatory organizations that have already conducted climate scenario analysis have followed  this model of using the scenarios produced by the Network for Greening the Financial System as  a starting point and tailoring them to capture local conditions, including the European Central  Bank and financial regulators in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom.11     Of course, as noted, banks similarly must create scenarios that capture their unique risk  profiles, but any material deviations from the benchmark scenarios that capture a bank’s unique  risks can be explained in a summary of its scenario analysis to note why the deviations were  made. This is similar to how the current stress tests are designed and conducted and should be a  practice that is utilized with climate scenario analysis as well. That is, in the U.S. the federal  banking agencies expect the scenarios that banks use for their internal stress tests to be plausible  and be of a similar severity as the scenarios that the agencies use themselves while being tailored  to their unique risks.    The FDIC Must Rescind the Rule Limiting the Role of Supervisory Guidance in the  Supervisory Process      Supervisory criticisms, and the guidance that often informs them, are valuable tools that  help prevent unsafe or abusive bank conduct from ripening into outright violations of law,  dangerous instability, and consumer harm. The rule proposed by the Agencies in 2020 and  finalized by the FDIC in March of last year has limited the role of supervisory guidance in the  final stage of issuing supervisory assessments of banks for unsafe or unsound practices. It is now  more difficult for bank supervisors to hold banks— including the largest banks, which can pose a  direct threat to financial stability and the economic wellbeing of the public when badly  managed—accountable for dangerous practices, poor management, and ineffective oversight by  bank boards of directors in a principles-based supervisory approach. This applies as well to these  proposed principles for climate risks.      As such, the FDIC – along with the other regulatory agencies – must rescind the rule so  that these principles, as well as all other principles that are part of supervisory guidance, would  have their intended impact.     Conclusion    Better Markets is supportive of the FDIC fully incorporating climate risks into the  supervisory assessment process. The proposed principles are a significant and positive step in    11 Speech by Governor Lael Brainard At the 2021 Federal Reserve Stress Testing Research Conference, Building  Climate Scenario Analysis on the Foundations of Economic Research (October 7, 2021), Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20211007a.htm.

Better Markets also calls for the rescission of a rule limiting the role of supervisory guidance, arguing it undermines effective supervision.

Banks should have the ability to lend to any consumer  or corporate citizen who is creditworthy and engaged in lawful activity, without fear of political or  regulatory retribution.  Accordingly, we vehemently oppose the FDIC or any financial regulator using the  banking system to advance a climate agenda by pressuring banks to choke-off select customer or  industry access to credit.      Although the FDIC’s statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management only applies  to large financial institutions, namely those with $100 billion or more total consolidated assets, we are  concerned community banks and their local communities will be negatively impacted if large financial  institutions are pressured or required to “de-risk” their loan portfolios and choke-off lawful but climate  disfavored customers or industries from the financial system.  Financial risks, physical risks, and transition risks already exist within the banking system - and financial  institutions adequately manage these risks using longstanding and time-tested risk management  practices.  Neither the FDIC nor any financial regulator should cause or worsen transition risks by  pressuring banks to de-risk lawful but climate-disfavored customers or industries under a newly formed  climate-related financial risk management framework.  ICBA and the undersigned state banking associations are also concerned these principles may eventually  trickle down and be applied to community banks, either directly through future rulemaking or indirectly  as “best practices.”  The steep expense, complex models, governance requirements, and specialized  expertise that would be necessary for community banks and their customers to bear, if these principles  applied to banks with fewer than $100 billion total consolidated assets, would be cost and resource  prohibitive for the thousands of community banks that proudly serve Main Street and have survived  decades of natural disasters and climate events.    Further, we are concerned the FDIC’s principles on data, risk measurement and reporting could  eventually require community banks to gather climate data directly from their customers, vendors, and  other third-parties.  Consumers and small businesses (many of which do not have, and are unable to 
collect, sophisticated climate data) should never be compelled to produce climate data as a condition  for obtaining basic banking services.  The mere existence of risk (whether financial, physical or transition risk) does not, in and of itself,  constitute a threat to the safety and soundness of individual banks or the financial system.  Instead, the  relevant question is whether banks and their regulators are properly managing such risks.  As evidenced  by the fact the FDIC’s principles do not identify even a single instance of bank failure in the aftermath of  a severe weather event, banks throughout the entire history of the U.S. banking system have universally  demonstrated an ability to manage climate risks.   As the FDIC develops its approach to climate-related financial risk management, we encourage the FDIC  to conduct studies, review the FDIC’s nearly one hundred years of banking data, and gather empirical  information to better understand the efficacy of the current risk management framework in managing  climate-related financial risk, the need to address any specific gaps in the current framework, and the  degree to which climate-related financial risk may or may not actually threaten the safety and  soundness of the financial system.

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20429    Re: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions [RIN 3064-ZA32]    Via comments@fdic.gov     Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am pleased to provide these comments in response to the release by the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of its draft “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial  Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.”1    General Comments    Section 1(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act reads:    (a)  Establishment of Corporation.--There is hereby established a Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the ""Corporation"") which shall insure,  as hereinafter provided, the deposits of all banks and savings associations which are  entitled to the benefits of insurance under this Act, and which shall have the powers  hereinafter granted. (emphasis added)    The FDIC mission statement reads:    The mission of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is to maintain stability  and public confidence in the nation's financial system. In support of this goal, the FDIC:    • Insures deposits,  • Examines and supervises financial institutions for safety and soundness  and consumer protection,  • Works to make large and complex financial institutions resolvable, and  • Manages receiverships.2    There is nothing in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the FDIC mission statement about  climate change, curing cancer or a hundred other worthy objectives.    1 Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions” Notice  of Proposed Policy Statement; Request for Comment, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Register, Vol.  87, No. 64, April 4, 2022, pp. 19507-19512 https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2022-04-04/pdf/2022- 07065.pdf.   2 What We Do, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation https://www.fdic.gov/about/what-we-do/index.html.  
  “Climate-related” financial risks are only relevant to the FDIC’s actual mission if they are  material to the safety and soundness of the supervised banks. As a factual matter, climate- related risks are generally not material to the safety and soundness of banks. Constant repetition  by regulators and politicians that they are does not make it so. But to the extent climate-related  financial risks are actually financially material and determinable, current laws and  regulations require that those risks be addressed. There is no need for additional rules.     Indeed, virtually the entire “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions ” document reads as if Part 364 of Title 12 of the  Code of Federal Regulations (relating to Safety and Soundness) and section 20.1 of the Risk  Management Manual of Examination Policies (relating to “Risk-Focused, Forward-Looking  Safety and Soundness Supervision”)3 were summarized and then the words “climate-related  financial” were inserted in front of the word “risk” wherever it occurred.     There is no legitimate reason to single out climate-related risks for special treatment as compared  to the hundreds of other types of material risk – risks that usually more important. If the FDIC  stays in its lane and only addresses climate-related financial risks that are actually material and  determinable under current bank supervision principles, then such an approach will do relatively  little damage. There is good reason to believe, however, that is not what is really going on.     What is going on is submission to political demands from the White House to weaponize  financial regulation in furtherance of progressive political objectives4 and to use bank  supervision to allocate credit toward favored industries and away from disfavored industries.   Attempting to further progressive political and social objectives unrelated to the FDIC’s actual  mission will make any such regulation economically suspect and may well result in a court  holding that the FDIC does not have the statutory authority to promulgate the regulation. FDIC  attempts to circumvent the Administrative Procedure Act by the use of guidance or “principles”   documents, examinations and enforcement actions will be similarly suspect.     Before this guidance document becomes the basis for any enforcement action or any bank  examination, the FDIC needs to do the hard work of writing an Administrative Procedure Act  compliant rule providing notice and seeking public comment. If it does so, the points made in the  sections below regarding the complexity and deep ambiguity involved in undertaking the  “climate-related” risk assessment enterprise will become quite evident. The FDIC also needs to  seek OIRA clearance and, further, comply with Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork  Reduction Act, Executive Order No. 12866 and related executive orders. It should not seek to  evade the APA and other regulatory requirements by issuing guidance or principles documents  that are really rules and then moving immediately to enforcement of the rule masquerading as    3 See, for example, 12 CFR §364.101 et. Seq. https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-12/chapter-III/subchapter-B/part- 364; “Risk-Focused, Forward-Looking Safety and Soundness Supervision,” Section 20.1, Risk Management Manual  of Examination Policies https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/section20-1.pdf.  4 See especially, “Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk,” section 3, May 20, 2021  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related- financial-risk/. The Executive Order like the “Principles” document is almost entirely unsullied by citations to facts. 
guidance by means of the bank supervision process. These deficiencies may well lead to a  determination that the “Principles” are unlawful when subjected to judicial review.    Summary of the Problems with FDIC Regulation of “Climate-Related Financial Risk”    1. Additional Climate Change Requirements Would Impede the FDIC’s Important Mission. The  important mission of the FDIC is to ensure the safety and soundness of banks and to insure  deposits. Requirements relating to climate-related financial risk beyond those required under  existing requirements related to material risks would impede rather than further that mission. It  would affirmatively harm depositors, customers, bank shareholders, taxpayers, and the economy.    2. Requiring Banks to Devote Resources and Inappropriately Weight Immaterial Climate Change  “Risk” Will Increase Rather than Decrease Risk. Requiring banks to inappropriately weight  climate-related financial risks that are not actually material and to devote resources to risks that  are not actually material or determinable will reduce the focus on, and weight given to, risks that  actually are material. Banks are likely to distort their risk assessments to satisfy a politicized  FDIC. To the extent that banks begin focusing on immaterial or lesser “climate-related” risks out  of concern for satisfying politicized regulators, instead of focusing on real, material risks, the  risks borne by the financial system will increase, not decrease.    3. Climate Models and Climate Science are Highly Uncertain. There is a massive amount of  variance among various climate models and uncertainty regarding the future of the climate.      I am no climate science expert. Nor, I suspect, is anyone at the FDIC since climate science is  way outside of the FDIC’s lane. I do know a thing or two about modeling in an economics  context. Models are typically highly dependent on a few relationships specified in their equations  and parameters. A small number of assumptions about relationships and parameters drive results.  For example, a model examining the impact of proposed tax policy might adopt a neoclassical  view where the impact of the proposed tax changes on the user cost of capital and labor response  are central (as specified in the equations) and the empirical parameters (as specified in the  elasticities) governing investment and labor are key.5 Seemingly small adjustments to elasticities  (even though within the bounds established in the empirical literature) result is significantly  different results. A Keynesian “macroeconomic” approach focusing on aggregate demand would  yield dramatically different results, operate on different principles and lead to different policy  recommendations. And so on.    Climate modeling is, in principle, no different. A small number of equations and empirical  parameters drive results. Even the conventional governmental source -- the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change – shows massive variations in projections and shows the wide  divergence in the ability of models to account for past warming6 and the degree of warming that    5 Parker Sheppard and David Burton, “How the GOP Tax Bill Will Affect the Economy,” Daily Signal, November  17, 2017 https://www.dailysignal.com/2017/11/17/gop-tax-bill-will-affect-economy/.

is anthropogenic.7 The worst-case concentration pathway, for example, assumes unlikely   projections regarding coal usage, high population growth, low economic growth and slow  technological progress.8 Using the worst-case scenario of these emissions concentration  pathways as the business-as-usual scenario will mislead the private sector, policymakers, and  regulators on the estimated climate impacts and costs.9 In fact, in a normal financial context, the  use of such a model with such assumptions would be regarded as fraudulent.    Once you broaden your reading to include those that do not have a financial or political interest  in climate change alarmism, it becomes clear that the variance and uncertainty in climate  modeling is even higher than the IPCC report indicates.10 It is clear that various models yield  dramatically different results. Explaining the details of these dramatic differences in model  outcomes is beyond the scope of this letter and my current competence. It is also beyond the  ability of the FDIC and its bank examiners.    4. Economic Modeling of Climate Change Effects is Even More Uncertain. There is an even  higher degree of variance and uncertainty associated with attempts to model or project the  economic impact of highly divergent and uncertain climate models. Any estimate of the  economic impact of climate change would have to rely on highly uncertain and divergent climate  model results discussed above. In addition to this high degree of uncertainty would be added an  entirely new family of economic ambiguity and uncertainty. Any economic estimate of the  impact of climate change would also have to choose a discount rate to arrive at the present  discounted value of future costs and benefits of climate change and to estimate the future costs  and benefits of various regulatory or private responses. The choice of discount rate is  controversial and important.

climate change (sea level rises, the impact on agriculture, etc.). Estimates would need to be made  of the cost of various remediation techniques. Guesses would need to be made about the rate of  technological change. Guesses would need to be made about the regulatory, tax and other  responses of a myriad of governments. Estimates would need to be made using conventional  economic techniques regarding the economic impact of those changes which, in turn, would  reflect a wide variety of techniques and in many cases a thin or non-existent empirical literature.  Guesses would need to be made of market responses to all of these changes since market  participants will not stand idly by and do nothing as markets and the regulatory environment  change.     Then, after making decisions regarding all of these extraordinarily complex, ambiguous and  uncertain issues, banks would then need to assess the likely impact of climate change on their  specific business years into the future – a business that may by then bear little resemblance to its  existing business. Then, the FDIC would need to assess the accuracy of the banks “risk  assessment” based on this speculative house of cards. The idea that all of this can be done in a  way that will meaningfully improve the regulation of the safety and soundness of banks is not  credible.    5. The FDIC Does Not Possess the Expertise to Competently Assess Climate Models or the  Economic Impact of Climate Change. The FDIC has neither the expertise to assess climate  models nor the expertise to assess economic models purporting to project the economic impact of  divergent and uncertain climate projections.    6. The FDIC Has Neither the Expertise nor the Administrative Ability to Assess the Accuracy of  Banks’ Climate Change Risk Assessments. The FDIC does not have the expertise or  administrative ability to assess the accuracy, or lack thereof, of banks’ “climate change risk  assessments” based on bank-specific speculation regarding the impact of climate change which  would be based on bank-specific choices regarding highly divergent and uncertain economic  models projecting the economic impact of climate changes based on bank-specific choices  regarding highly divergent and uncertain climate models.    7. FDIC Resources Are Better Spent Furthering Its Mission. Imposing these requirements and  developing the expertise to police such climate change risk assessment, even if limited to large  banks, will involve the expenditure of very substantial resources. If the FDIC ever extends these  rules to the roughly 3,100 supervised institutions, the expenditure by the FDIC would be  mammoth. These resources would be much better spent furthering the FDIC’s actual mission.    8. The Costs Imposed on Regulated Entities Would be Large. Requiring regulated entities to  develop climate modeling expertise, the ability to make macroeconomic projections based on  these models and then make firm-specific economic assessments based on these climate and  economic models will be expensive, imposing costs that will amount to hundreds of millions of  dollars (if limited to large banks) and billions of dollars if generalized. These expenses must be  recovered by the banks one way or another. They would harm investors by reducing shareholder  returns or customers by increasing costs (to borrowers) or returns (to depositors or other lenders).    
9. If these Rules are Generalized to Apply to All Banks, Climate Change Risk Assessment  Requirements Would Further Reduce the Attractiveness of Forming a New Bank and Have a  Disproportionate Adverse Impact on Small Banks. Regulatory requirements imposed on large  banks have a way of eventually being imposed on all banks. The large bank requirement is a trial  run, a pilot program if you will. Regulatory costs do not increase linearly with size. The cost of  creating a climate change risk assessment model is not much greater for a large bank than for a  small one. And so on. Imposing comparable costs on small banks as large banks will make them  less competitive since the costs must be spread over a smaller customer base.    10. Climate Change Risk Assessment Requirements Would Create a New Compliance Eco- System and a New Lobby to Retain the Requirements. The imposition of such requirements  would result in the creation of a new compliance eco-system and pro-complexity lobby  composed of the economists, accountants, attorneys and compliance officers that live off of the  new requirements. This is already starting to happen.11    11. Banking Laws are a Poor Mechanism to Address Externalities. Externalities, such as  pollution, should be addressed by either enhancing property rights or, in the case of unowned  resources such as the air and waterways, by a regulatory response that carefully assesses the  costs and benefits of the regulatory response. Banking safety and soundness regulation is the  wrong place to try to address externalities. Policing externalities is far outside of the scope of  FDIC’s mission and the purpose of the banking laws.    12. Efforts to Redefine Materiality or the Broader Purpose of Business should be Opposed. There  is a major push to redefine what is deemed material for securities regulation purposes. This  “Principles” document is the beginning of a similar push with respect to determining what is  material risk in banking regulation.     Simply because some politically motivated investors seek to impose a disclosure requirement on  issuers, for example, does not make such a requirement material. The effort to redefine  materiality in the securities laws (and now banking) is part of an increasingly strident effort to  redefine the purpose of businesses more generally to achieve various social or political  objectives unrelated to earning a return, satisfying customers, or treating workers or suppliers  fairly. This is being done under the banner of social justice; corporate social responsibility  (CSR); stakeholder theory; environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria; socially  responsible investing (SRI); sustainability; diversity; business ethics; common-good capitalism;  or corporate actual responsibility. The social costs of ESG and broader efforts to repurpose  business firms will be considerable. Wages will decline or grow more slowly, firms will be less  productive and less internationally competitive, investor returns will decline, innovation will  slow, goods and services quality will decline and their prices will increase.       11 Jean Eaglesham, “Wall Street’s Green Push Exposes New Conflicts of Interest: Auditors, Bond Raters and Others  Aim to Profit by Both Judging and Advising Companies on their ESG Scores,” Wall Street Journal, January 29,  2022.

Banking regulation risk assessments should be limited to those risks that impose a substantial,  material financial risk for banks. Period. Full stop. While climate-related risks can fall into that  category, they rarely do. And, more importantly, to the extent that they do, no additional  regulation is required. The current rules would cover material risks associated with climate  change.    The Social Costs of ESG    The broader social costs associated with ESG requirements can, in principle, be quantified. This  section provides an analytical framework that may be useful in analyzing the social welfare costs  of ESG requirements.     To the extent ESG objectives are not pursued by businesses for the purpose of making a profit, R  > RESG/CSR, where R is the rate of return on investment in the absence of ESG, CSR, sustainability  requirements, diversity requirements, or stakeholder theory implementation, and RESG/CSR is the  rate of return after implementation of those requirements. The difference, R - RESG/CSR, is  economically analogous to a tax. It is a reduction in return due to the pursuit of ESG objectives.  Thus, R - RESG/CSR = TaxESG/CSR. This means that various techniques used in public finance to  analyze the social welfare impact of taxes may be used to quantitatively analyze the social welfare  cost of these provisions (i.e., TaxESG/CSR).     A tax has an excess burden or deadweight loss that can be calculated.12 By introducing a wedge  (TaxESG/CSR) between, in this case, the gross return and the net return, ESG/CSR reduces the size  of the capital market and therefore output and employment. In a well-functioning market, the price  of a capital asset should be equal to the present value of the expected future income stream  generated by the asset net of taxes and depreciation.13 Introducing a new tax (in this case  TaxESG/CSR) would reduce the expected future income stream, and therefore, the price of the asset.  It would also cause investment to flow out of the affected sector or jurisdiction.     Who bears the actual economic burden of the corporate income tax is an open question.14 The  analysis of who bears the burden of TaxESG/CSR would be the same. One thing is certain: It cannot  be corporations. A corporation is a legal fiction, and legal fictions do not pay taxes—people pay    12Arnold C.

taxes. The corporate tax could be borne by corporate shareholders in the form of lower returns;15  owners of all capital (again in the form of lower returns);16 corporate customers in the form of  higher prices;17 or employees (in the form of lower wages).18 It is, almost certainly, some  combination of these.19 The economics profession has changed its thinking on this issue several  times over the past four decades, but the latest —and highly plausible —consensus is that workers  probably bear more than half of the burden of the corporate income tax because capital is highly  mobile.20 Labor’s share of the corporate tax burden is potentially as high as three-quarters.21    15Government estimators are among the few who cling to the view that shareholders bear most of the burden.

Shareholders (investors) probably bear most of the remainder.22 Initially (i.e., in the short run), the  impact on shareholder returns would be greater. Adjustments take time. In the long run, ESG  requirements (TaxESG/CSR) would have a disproportionately negative impact on labor due to capital  factor mobility.     Specific Requests for Comment    Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its climate- related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile,  and scope of operations?    Answer 2: The FDIC has to move beyond simply making abstract demands on banks and do the  hard work of explaining how climate modeling, economic modeling, bank specific assessments  of climate relating risk, projections of future government policy and so forth can actually be  done to the FDIC’s satisfaction. There is, quite literally, nothing in the Principles document that  provides any meaningful guidance to banks about how to do these things.    Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft principles  into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with financial  institutions to understand those challenges?    Answer 3: As discussed above, the challenges are legion and the FDIC, while making inordinate  demands, has done nothing to address the actual problems that banks will face when they attempt  to comply with these demands. Banks will be forced to choose a climate model and choose an  economics model notwithstanding the enormous variance and uncertainty associated with these  models. They will then be forced to make a series of guesses built on speculation about the  impact on their bank and its customers based on those models and speculation about future  government policies and market responses. All with no meaningful guidance from the FDIC.    Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and  assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?    Answer 7: The proper answer to this question is that they should not consider a particular time  horizon but should appropriately discount the future so that costs far into the future will be  discounted and only be material if extremely large. As discussed above, the choice of discount  rate is extremely important.     Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better  capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?    Answer 12: The Securities Exchange Commission has proposed and will probably adopt climate  change disclosure requirements that will apply to these large banks (since they are all public  companies). The SEC has estimated that these rules will triple the cost of being a public  company (See PRA Table 4 in the proposing release). That is enough.      22As opposed to non-corporate capital and customers.

Burton, a Senior Fellow in Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation, critiques the FDIC's draft ""Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions."" He argues that climate-related financial risks are not material to the safety and soundness of banks and that existing regulations already cover any such risks.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention: Comments-RIN (3064-ZA32)  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th St N.W.  Washington, DC 20429      Re:  Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large     Financial Institutions (RIN 3064-ZA32)    Ladies and Gentlemen:  On behalf of its members, the Risk Management Association’s Climate Risk Consortium  (“RMA Consortium”) thanks the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) for the  opportunity to comment on its proposed principles for climate-related financial risk  management for large banks (“Proposal”).   Launched in September 2021, the RMA Consortium seeks to assist banks in integrating  climate risk management throughout their operations, preparing the industry to help  economies transition to a low-carbon future.  The RMA Consortium, representing 30  leading U.S. and Canadian banking organizations, also aims to advance climate risk  management practices in the banking industry by facilitating the development of  industry-wide taxonomies and standards.   Before responding to the Proposal, the RMA Consortium wishes to express its  appreciation for the FDIC’s efforts to assist banking organizations under its oversight in  developing climate-related financial risk management practices.  Our member institutions  welcome the FDIC’s engagement with banking organizations as the agency develops its  approach to climate-related financial risk.    The RMA Consortium also appreciates that the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency (“OCC”) have proposed similar guidance,1 which will promote more  efficient and effective climate-related risk management practices.  As the RMA                                                    1   Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021) [hereinafter “OCC Proposal”]. 
  2    1007823514v8  Contact us & learn more at  www.rmahq.org  1801 Market Street, Suite 300    Philadelphia, PA 19103  Consortium explained in its comment letter to the OCC on its proposal (“OCC  Proposal”),2 the RMA Consortium broadly supports the Proposal’s principles-based  approach, preference for scenario analysis over traditional regulatory stress testing,  recognition of current data, modeling and methodological challenges for banks, and  general alignment with best practices for risk management.  The RMA Consortium also  appreciates the FDIC’s intention to “appropriately tailor any resulting supervisory  expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as complexity of  operations and business models”3 and distinguish the roles and responsibilities of boards  of directors from those of management.    Nonetheless, our members recommend that the final guidance, which we hope to be  issued on an interagency basis, include important clarifications.  Throughout this letter  and in our comment letter to the OCC, we explain in greater detail our recommendations.   In sum, we recommend the final guidance:  1. Define a compliance approach that accounts for the time that banks will require to  implement the climate-related financial risk management processes outlined in the  guidance and incorporate climate-related financial risks into decision-making  processes;  2. Support more explicitly banks’ use of a risk-based approach in implementing the  principles so that banks’ climate-related financial risk management practices are  proportionate to the extent of their exposures, consistent with how banks treat  other risk exposures;   3. Acknowledge that (a) at present, banks may determine it appropriate to prioritize  assessing potential climate-related financial risk impacts over the time horizons  that banks use in strategic planning and related assessment processes and (b) once  assessment capabilities mature, consistency in the time horizons used by banks  may be beneficial by facilitating industry benchmarking;    4. Align with other U.S. bank regulators’ approaches to climate scenario analysis so  that banking organizations subject to supervision by multiple banking regulators  are subject to consistent requirements;  5. Clarify that the scope of the board of director’s responsibility to oversee climate- related financial risk is consistent with the scope of its responsibility to oversee  other risks facing the bank;                                                     2   Id.  3   87 Fed.

Clarify expectations with respect to (a) banks’ consideration of climate-related  financial risk impacts on low-to-moderate income (“LMI”) and other  disadvantaged households and communities and (b) public communications  regarding banks’ climate-related strategies; and  7. Harmonize with bank regulatory frameworks and approaches for climate-related  financial risk management in foreign jurisdictions.    We believe that these modifications are consistent with the FDIC’s objectives and the  Proposal.  The final guidance will be a significant milestone in the establishment of a  U.S. bank regulatory framework for climate risk, making these clarifications all the more  important.  The requested changes will help the final guidance achieve the FDIC’s  objective to support the “efforts by banks to focus on key aspects of climate risk  management.”    I.  The final guidance should define a compliance approach that accounts for  the time that banks will require to implement the climate-related financial  risk management processes outlined in the guidance and incorporate climate- related financial risks into decision-making processes.  A.  Observations and Considerations4  As a general matter, the “development and implementation of processes to identify,  measure, monitor, and control climate-related financial risk exposures within [a bank’s]  existing risk management framework” will require a reasonable time period to complete  in a safe and sound manner.  Implementation of the guidance will require, among other  things, modifications to or development of new systems, technology, models, processes,  policies and governance structures.  As best practices for climate risk management  continue to evolve, banks and supervisors will need to continue to collaborate to define  those practices.  Moreover, challenges exist in developing effective climate-related financial risk  management practices, such as those outlined in the Proposal, due to issues of data,  models and methodologies.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) Report  on Climate-Related Financial Risk (“FSOC Report”) describes several of these  challenges, including:   Limitations on data, in particular, data “connecting the science of climate change  to financial risk assessments and real-world economic impacts”;5                                                     4   This section is, in part, responsive to Question 3 posed by the FDIC: “What challenges do banks face  in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems?” 
  4    1007823514v8  Contact us & learn more at  www.rmahq.org  1801 Market Street, Suite 300    Philadelphia, PA 19103   Uncertainty about the time horizons over which certain risks (e.g., transition risks,  longer-term risks) may manifest;6 and    The non-linear and complex nature of the impacts of climate change, which  makes it difficult to forecast the frequency and intensity of severe climate events  and assess the interlinkages between climate-related pathways and economic  variables across the financial system.7  The FSOC Report also recognizes that better data and improved methods are essential  prerequisites for the ability to measure and assess climate-related financial risk, stating:  “enhancing the availability of and access to relevant, comprehensive data and developing  methods and metrics to effectively utilize climate-related data and financial data” are  “[n]ecessary steps for measuring and assessing climate-related financial risk.”8  Gaps in  data, notes the FSOC report, render results of scenario analyses unreliable.9  Thus, banks  will require a reasonable time period to enhance relevant data, models and methods so  that processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control climate-related financial risk  exposures are more reliable and, thus, of greater utility.   The FDIC is aware of these issues, stating that the “FDIC recognizes that incorporation  of material climate-related financial risks into various planning processes is iterative as  measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing these risks continue to  evolve and mature over time.”10  However, the Proposal also describes expectations for  the identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of climate-related financial risk  exposures without accounting for insufficiencies in the current methodologies, models  and data upon which such processes and practices rely.    B.  Recommendations  The final guidance should account more explicitly and comprehensively for the time  banks will require to implement the processes to identify, measure, monitor, and control                                                                                                                                                    5   Financial Stability Oversight Council, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, at 23 (Oct. 2021)  [hereinafter, “FSOC Report”].  6   Id.  7   Id.  8   Id. at 47.    9   Id. at 49.  (“While a large amount of potentially relevant data for climate-related physical risks  currently exists, more work is needed to improve access to this data and incorporate it into financial  risk assessments . . . This data is not standardized in a way that facilitates the aggregation of datasets  across entities or industry sectors and may require extensive work before it is usable.”).  10   The Proposal also states that in conveying the results of climate-related scenario analysis,  management should convey the “uncertainty of results.”  See 87 Fed. Reg. 19507, 19510 (Apr. 4,  2022).

In particular, the final guidance should:   Establish reasonable expectations for banks’ near-term climate-related financial  risk management capabilities, including by supporting more explicitly banks’ use  of reasonably available methods to begin identifying, measuring, monitoring and  controlling climate-related financial risks while continuing to develop more  robust capabilities.  For example, the final guidance should clarify that qualitative  risk appetite statements may be more appropriate than quantitative expressions of  risk appetite until quantitative methods are sufficiently reliable;    Clarify that (a) the FDIC does not expect banks’ conformance with the guidance  by a particular date but, rather, that banks work in earnest toward developing and  implementing their climate-related financial risk management practices and make  iterative, demonstrable progress and (b) at least in the near term, the FDIC does  not anticipate that gaps in a bank’s practices would result in an informal or formal  enforcement action except in very unusual circumstances; and     State the FDIC’s intention to assess banks’ progress in addressing climate-related  financial risks and publish anonymized results to enable industry benchmarking,  foster innovation, and facilitate the development of best practices.   II.  The final guidance should support more explicitly banks’ use of a risk-based  approach in implementing the principles so that banks’ climate-related  financial risk management practices are proportionate to the extent of their  exposures, consistent with how banks treat other risk exposures.  A.  Observations and Considerations  The RMA Consortium appreciates the Proposal’s principles-based approach and the  flexibility that it affords banks to adapt, as best practices in climate-related financial risk  management continue to evolve, and tailor their programs to more effectively address  their climate-related financial risks and unique circumstances.  More broadly, the RMA Consortium’s members believe that banks should employ a risk- based approach in managing climate-related financial risk and implement practices that  are commensurate with the extent of their exposure, as well as their business model,  complexity, and risk profile.  This is consistent with the FDIC’s examination approach, 
  6    1007823514v8  Contact us & learn more at  www.rmahq.org  1801 Market Street, Suite 300    Philadelphia, PA 19103  which is tailored based on each institution’s business model, complexity, and risk  profile.11    The RMA Consortium appreciates that the FDIC plans to “appropriately tailor any  resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as  complexity of operations and business models,” consistent with the FDIC’s approach to  risk-based supervision.12  As a general matter, we anticipate that, ultimately, all banking  organizations will be subject to supervisory expectations with respect to their climate- related financial risk management practices, and embedding proportionality in those  expectations will be important.  As to the Proposal, aspects of it suggest that banks  employ a risk-based approach to address climate-related financial risk management.  For  example, the Proposal describes multiple practices and processes for prioritizing material  climate-related financial risks, rather than simply stating that banks must address all  climate-related financial risks.    However, the Proposal does not explicitly encourage banks to scale their climate-related  financial risk management responses based on the extent of their exposures, sizes,  activities or other factors.  By way of comparison, the “Proposed Interagency Guidance  on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management” recommends that third-party  relationship risk management be based on “the level of risk, complexity, and size of the  banking organization and the nature of the third-party relationship.”13  B.  Recommendations  We recommend that the final guidance expressly adopt the concept of proportionality and  further emphasize a risk-based approach to managing climate-related financial risks.   Specifically, we recommend that the final guidance:   Reflect a principles-based approach, as currently proposed, and not prescribe  particular risk management practices;14   State that banks should employ a risk-based approach that considers materiality in  managing climate-related financial risk, consistent with how banks determine  materiality and manage other risks; and                                                    11   See “RMS Manual of Examination Policies: Risk-Focused, Forward-Looking Safety Soundness  Supervision,” FDIC (2021), available at https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/section20- 1.pdf.   12   87 Fed. Reg. 19507, 19509 (Apr. 4, 2022).  13   86 Fed. Reg. 38182, 38185 (July 19, 2021).  14   This recommendation is responsive to Question 4 posed by the FDIC: “Would regulations or  guidelines prescribing particular risk management practices be helpful to financial institutions as they  adjust to doing business in a changing climate?” 
  7    1007823514v8  Contact us & learn more at  www.rmahq.org  1801 Market Street, Suite 300    Philadelphia, PA 19103   Clarify that banks should design and implement climate-related financial risk  management practices and processes that are commensurate with the extent of  their exposures to climate-related financial risk, in addition to their size,  complexity, business activities, and overall risk profile.15   III.  The final guidance should acknowledge that (a) at present, banks may  determine it appropriate to prioritize assessing potential climate-related  financial risk impacts over the time horizons that banks use in strategic  planning and related assessment processes and (b) once assessment  capabilities mature, consistency in the time horizons used by banks may be  beneficial by facilitating industry benchmarking.   A.  Observations and Considerations  The Proposal states that “[a]s part of forward-looking strategic planning, the board and  management should address the potential impact of climate-related financial risk  exposures on the bank’s financial condition, operations (including geographic locations),  and business objectives over various time horizons.”16  The Proposal also notes that  relevant time horizons for understanding “the potential ways in which these risks could  evolve … may include those that extend beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning  horizon.”17  The RMA Consortium appreciates the importance of banks’ exploring potential climate- related financial risk impacts over various time horizons, including time horizons that  extend beyond those typically used in financial risk assessments.  As the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”) explains in its report on measurement  methodologies for climate-related financial risks, “[c]onventional capital planning  horizons have tended towards two- to three-year forecasts …, while strategic planning at  banks has tended towards three- to five-year periods ….  Conversely, many physical  climate risks are expected to increase in materiality over a much longer horizon.”18                                                    15   We recognize that size and complexity of banking organizations can be correlated with their potential  to pose systemic risk.  That said, there may be instances in which larger banks are less vulnerable to  losses resulting from climate disaster.  Notably, a recent report released by Federal Reserve Bank of  New York staff revealed that, in the case of extreme weather events over the last quarter century,  “losses at larger (multi-county) banks [were] barely affected and their income increase[d] significantly  with exposure,” whereas local banks, which do not benefit from diversification across multiple  geographies, experienced more negative stability effects from extreme disasters.

Reg. 19507, 19509 (Apr. 4, 2022).  17   Id. at 19510.  18   See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-Related Financial Risks – Measurement  Methodologies (Apr. 2021), at 20–21, https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d518.pdf. 
  8    1007823514v8  Contact us & learn more at  www.rmahq.org  1801 Market Street, Suite 300    Philadelphia, PA 19103  For example, the FDIC’s “RMS Manual of Examination Policies” generally encourages  banks to develop three to five year strategic plans, stating, “The planning time horizon  will not be identical for every bank, but a three- to five-year planning horizon is generally  satisfactory for most banks.”19  The RMA Consortium requests that the FDIC, as part of  its ongoing work to develop a supervisory response to climate-related financial risks, to  consider the expectation in the Proposal that, “[a]s part of forward-looking strategic  planning,” a bank “should address the potential impact of climate-related financial risk  exposures on the bank’s financial condition, operations … and business objectives over  various time horizons,” in light of the fact that climate-related financial risks can manifest  over much longer time horizons.    We also note that the Federal Reserve Board (“Federal Reserve”) requires nine-quarter  projection periods for its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”).20   After assessment capabilities mature, we encourage the FDIC to adopt an approach  toward time horizons consistent with those of the OCC and Federal Reserve. This would  be consistent with the Federal Reserve’s view that “[a] consistent approach across bank  regulatory agencies will best support the effective management of [climate-related]  risks.”21    We also appreciate the Proposal’s and OCC’s Proposal’s alignment with other U.S.  banking regulators in selecting scenario analysis rather than traditional stress testing  exercises in the context of climate-related financial risks.  The Federal Reserve has  distinguished scenario analysis from stress testing22 and has stated that the agency  currently only is developing a program on climate-related scenario analysis.23   Additionally, the FSOC Report strongly recommended that member agencies use  scenario analysis and did not recommend climate stress testing akin to the Dodd-Frank  Act Stress Tests or CCAR.24                                                      19   See “RMS Manual of Examination Policies: Section 4.1 Management,” FDIC (2022), available at  https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/section4-1.pdf.  20   Annual Company-Run Stress Test Requirements for Banking Organizations With Total Consolidated  Assets Over $10 Billion Other Than Covered Companies, 77 Fed.

Recommendations25  The final guidance should:    Retain the Proposal’s focus on scenario analysis rather than traditional stress  testing, consistent with the Federal Reserve’s approach and FSOC’s  recommendations; and    Outline expectations for scenario analysis frameworks and exercises—including  with respect to time horizons, assumptions regarding “plausible future states,”  requirements regarding which portfolios are stressed, and use of third-party  scenarios—that are consistent with those that the Federal Reserve ultimately  issues.  IV.  The final guidance should clarify that the scope of a board of director’s  responsibility to oversee climate-related financial risk is consistent with the  scope of its responsibility to oversee other risks facing the bank.   A.  Observations and Considerations  The RMA Consortium appreciates the FDIC’s plan to distinguish the roles and  responsibilities of the board and management with respect to climate-related financial  risk oversight in the final guidance. We believe the FDIC’s ongoing coordination with the  Federal Reserve and OCC in this area is important.  Both regulators have issued recent  guidance addressing the responsibilities of the board, as distinct from those of  management.26  B.  Recommendations  The final guidance should clarify that expectations regarding climate-related financial  risk management and the management of other risks are consistent.  Specifically, the final  guidance should clarify that the scope of a board of director’s responsibility to oversee  climate-related financial risk is consistent with the scope of its responsibility to oversee  other risks facing a bank,                                                                                                                                                    Reserve Board, OCC, and FDIC and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)  performed by the Federal Reserve Board on the largest banking organizations.”).  25   This section is, in part, responsive to Question 14 posed by the FDIC, “What factors are most salient  for the FDIC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises?”  26   See Federal Reserve, SR 21-3 / CA 21-1: Supervisory Guidance on Board of Directors’ Effectiveness  (Feb. 26, 2021), available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2103.htm;  OCC, Director's Book: Role of Directors for National Banks and Federal Savings Associations (Nov.  2020), available at https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/banker- education/files/directors-book.html.

The final guidance should clarify the FDIC’s expectations with respect to (a)  banks’ consideration of climate-related financial risk impacts on LMI and  other disadvantaged households and communities and (b) public  communications regarding banks’ climate-related strategies.  A.  Observations and Considerations   The RMA Consortium agrees with the FDIC’s statement in the Proposal that climate  change could have disproportionate impacts on the financially vulnerable, including LMI  and other disadvantaged households and communities, and that it is important for banks  to consider the implications on such stakeholders.  The RMA Consortium encourages the  FDIC to continue to collaborate with peer banking agencies, federal housing agencies,  and government sponsored enterprises to identify appropriate mechanisms for banks to  employ to respond to the potential impacts to these communities.  We appreciate the  banking agencies’ May 2022 proposal to update the Community Reinvestment Act  (“CRA”), which would allow banks to receive CRA credit for “disaster preparedness and  climate resiliency activities,” such as the development of financial products and services  to help the community prepare for future natural disasters.27  Our member institutions  welcome further discussion on this important issue.28   With respect to public statements, the Proposal calls for banks to “ensure that any public  statements about their banks’ climate-related strategies and commitments are consistent  with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements.”29  We encourage the FDIC to  clarify the wording of the expectation regarding public statements by stating that the  FDIC’s focus in this area is on whether banks make accurate disclosures regarding  climate risk plans, strategies, or actions.                                                      27   The current CRA guidance does not explicitly include credit for these activities, defined in the May  2022 proposal as “activities that assist individuals and communities to prepare for, adapt to, and  withstand natural disasters, weather-related disasters, or climate-related risks.” The May 2022  proposal also includes disaster preparedness and climate resiliency activities as “qualifying activities  in Native Land Areas.”  See OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, Joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:  Community Reinvestment Act (May 5, 2022), Section III.E.6(b).  We note that, in 2021, the New  York Department of Financial Services incorporated similar climate-based credit incentives into the  New York State Community Reinvestment Act. See New York State Department of Financial  Services, CRA Consideration for Activities that Contribute to Climate Mitigation and Adaptation  (Feb. 9, 2021),  https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20210209_cra_consideration.  28   This recommendation is responsive to part of Question 10 posed by the FDIC: “Should the agencies  modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment  Act, to address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged  communities?”  29   87 Fed. Reg. 19507, 19510 (Apr. 4, 2022). 
  11    1007823514v8  Contact us & learn more at  www.rmahq.org  1801 Market Street, Suite 300    Philadelphia, PA 19103  B.  Recommendations  The RMA Consortium encourages the FDIC to clarify its expectations with respect to (a)  banks’ consideration of climate-related financial risk impacts on LMI and other  disadvantaged households and communities and (b) public communications regarding  banks’ climate-related strategies in the following ways.   In order to effectively address disproportionate impacts, the RMA Consortium  encourages the FDIC to continue to collaborate with relevant agencies to identify  appropriate mechanisms for banks to employ to respond to potential climate- related financial risk impacts on LMI and other disadvantaged households and  communities, including through the CRA.   The final guidance should align expectations regarding banks’ public  communications with the U.S. securities disclosure regime, which requires  accuracy in public statements.  We further request that expectations regarding  public communications and disclosures align with any future rules and guidance  specifically related to climate disclosures issued by the Securities and Exchange  Commission.   VI.  The final guidance should harmonize with bank regulatory frameworks and  approaches for climate-related financial risk management in foreign  jurisdictions.   A.  Observations and Considerations  The RMA Consortium also appreciates the FDIC’s engagement on climate-risk  management with foreign banking regulators.  The scope of bank supervisors’ mandates  with respect to climate risk responses vary by jurisdiction, which may result in certain  requirements differing across jurisdictions.  Nevertheless, consistency to the extent of  consistent mandates among supervisors across jurisdictions in evaluating a bank’s  incorporation of climate-related financial risk management practices would facilitate  more efficient and effective compliance and climate-related financial risk management by  internationally-active banks and foreign-headquartered banks subject to international  laws and regulations on a consolidated, enterprise-wide basis.  B.  Recommendations  The final guidance should aim for high-level alignment internationally across  jurisdictions with consistent mandates.  In particular, the RMA Consortium recommends  the following:    The FDIC should seek to coordinate among cross-jurisdictional authorities and  aim for consistency in high-level industry standards across jurisdictions where 
  12    1007823514v8  Contact us & learn more at  www.rmahq.org  1801 Market Street, Suite 300    Philadelphia, PA 19103  appropriate, with the goal of creating “interoperable” climate-related financial risk  management guidance and principles.  As a result, the efforts of financial  institutions to create tools and processes with respect to climate risk management  in one jurisdiction may still be relevant and utilized to adhere to requirements in  another jurisdiction.  VII.  Conclusion  RMA Consortium appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments and  thanks the FDIC for its efforts in developing guidance for banks on climate-related  financial risk management practices.  The RMA Consortium looks forward to continuing  its engagement with the FDIC on these issues.   *  *  *  Sincerely,     Fran Garritt  Director         Risk Management Association","The Risk Management Association’s Climate Risk Consortium (RMA Consortium) submitted a comment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regarding its proposed principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. The RMA Consortium, representing 30 leading U.S. and Canadian banks, supports the FDIC's principles-based approach and appreciates the alignment with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). They recommend several clarifications in the final guidance, including defining a compliance approach that accounts for the time banks need to implement climate risk management processes, supporting a risk-based approach, and aligning with other U.S. regulators. They also suggest clarifying the board's responsibilities, considering impacts on low-to-moderate income communities, and harmonizing with international frameworks. The RMA Consortium emphasizes the importance of scenario analysis over traditional stress testing and calls for consistency in regulatory expectations across jurisdictions. They appreciate the FDIC's efforts and look forward to continued engagement."
2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-030,"1  Ref: KIG/66/2022  J u n e  3 ,  2 0 2 2  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street, NW  Washington, DC 20429    Japanese Bankers Association    JBA comments on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s draft Principles for  Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions    Dear Sirs/Madams:    The Japanese Bankers Association1 (JBA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions2 (hereafter “the Principles”), which provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound  management of exposure to climate-related financial risks.    We welcome that the FDIC’s Principles are broadly consistent with the proposed principles3 by the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision (hereafter “the BCBS Principles”), which will be a common baseline for  internationally active banks and supervisors. We encourage the FDIC to promote a domestically consistent  approach as well with other U.S. agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board.    Our member banks are in the process of implementing a climate-related financial risk management framework  at a group-wide level, engaging with the relevant regulators. If financial institutions with global operations are  required to comply with all the different guidelines in each jurisdiction, it would lead to ineffective risk  management and a burden for financial institutions. In order to avoid duplicative or different requirements for  financial institutions, we would like to ask the FDIC to continue to coordinate with international standard setting  bodies and jurisdictional supervisors. We would propose an interoperable approach where non-U.S. financial  institutions with U.S. operations can rely on and comply with the guidelines in their home country to the extent  they are consistent with the BCBS Principles and broadly aligned with the future FDIC guidance. For the same  reason of avoiding duplicative or different requirements, we also encourage the FDIC to coordinate with foreign  regulators to harmonize supervisory expectations to the greatest extent possible.    When incorporating climate-related financial risks into existing risk management, such as credit ratings and  credit costs, there are a number of challenges, including different time horizons (an extremely long term for  climate-related financial risks, which contrasts with current horizons used for existing risk management), and a  lack of data availability and credible data (such as data on the relationship between climate-related risks and  credit losses). Therefore, we recognize that it will require a considerable amount of time to establish quantitative  financial risk management practices at the client level. Given such data challenges and the evolution of climate  risk measurement methodologies/models, the future FDIC guidance needs to be flexible and principle-based.  We would like the FDIC to provide sufficient time for implementation of the future FDIC guidance,  incorporating the progress of international discussions and allowing us to take a phased approach to  implementation.    Also due to the challenges stated above, we believe that it will also be premature to include an expectation that                                                   1 The Japanese Bankers Association is the leading trade association for banks, bank holding companies and bankers associations in  Japan. As of June 3, 2022, JBA has 114 Full Members (banks), 3 Bank Holding Company Members (bank holding companies), 77  Associate Members (banks & bank holding companies), 58 Special Members (regionally-based bankers associations) and one Sub- Associate Member for a total of 253 members. Several of its largest member banks are active participants in the U.S. financial markets.  2 https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22027.html  3 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Consultative Document: Principles for the effective management and supervision of  climate-related financial risks  https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d530.pdf 
  2  financial institutions incorporate climate-related financial risks into their capital and liquidity planning  processes at this point in time, and that further data and development of quantitative tools and methodologies is  needed.      Comments on the General Principles    Strategic Planning  Given a lot of uncertainty around climate-related financial risks and data gaps, it will take a reasonable amount  of time to fully incorporate climate-related financial risks into business strategy and capital/risk appetite. We  would like to ask the FDIC to allow financial institutions to integrate climate-related financial risks into strategic  planning based on the data and methodologies that are available at this stage.    Scenario Analysis  We welcome the approach taken by the Principles, which recognize the distinction between scenario analysis  and traditional stress testing based on their different purposes. We believe that the future FDIC guidance also  needs to clearly differentiate between scenario analysis and stress testing.    We also support the idea that “management should develop and implement climate-related scenario analysis  frameworks in a manner commensurate to the institution’s size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile”  as stated in the Principles.      Comments on the Management of Risk Areas    Liquidity Risk, Other Financial Risk, Operational Risk, Legal/Compliance Risk, Other  Nonfinancial Risk  Further work will be necessary to understand the relationship between climate-related financial risks and  liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, and other financial/nonfinancial risk. In particular, we should achieve  a consistent and common understanding (measurement or methodology) of the transmission channel from the  risk driver of climate-related financial risks to each risk. Therefore, it might be premature at this stage to require  financial institutions to incorporate specific risk mitigation tools for those risks in the future FDIC guidance.  We would like the FDIC to secure enough time to take these risks into consideration, and allow us to apply  different time horizons for each risk category when implementing the guidance.      Response to the questions    Applicability  Question 1. What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model,  should inform financial institutions’ adoption of these principles?    The Principles set out that they are targeted at financial institutions with over $100 billion in total consolidated  assets. However, we believe that the scope of application of the future FDIC guidance needs to consider not  only asset size, but also to “reflect differences in institutions’ circumstances such as complexity of operations  and business models” in a comprehensive manner, as many factors can lead to material exposure to climate- related financial risks for financial institutions.    We agree that “all financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related  financial risks” as stated in the Principles. Therefore, we would like the FDIC to clarify the rationale to apply  the Principles only to large financial institutions, and clarify that the definition of “over $100 billion in total  consolidated assets” for non-U.S. financial institutions mean over $100 billion in total consolidated assets in the  U.S. rather than at the whole enterprise level. 
  3  At the same time, we believe that it is not appropriate to apply the same guidance both to “U.S. financial  institutions with over $100 billion in total assets” and to “non-U.S. financial institutions with combined U.S.  assets of over $100 billion” and that the FDIC should consider the circumstances and exposure to climate-related  financial risks of the U.S. operations of non-U.S. financial institutions in applying the Principles and future  FDIC guidance.    As noted above, we would also like to ask the FDIC to collaborate with the Federal Reserve Bank to harmonize  supervisory expectations for U.S. financial institutions, so that all financial institutions in the same  circumstances will be subject to the same supervisory expectations.    Tailoring  Question 2. How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its climate- related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile,  and scope of operations?    Since globally consistent standards for addressing climate-related financial risks and appropriate risk  management methodologies have not been established at present, we would like for the future FDIC guidance  to take a principle-based and flexible approach to enhance climate-related financial risk management practices  going forward.    Also, if the future guidance could provide good practices or case studies, it would help financial institutions to  enhance our capabilities for effective climate-related financial risk management.    We would welcome further opportunities for additional review before the FDIC finalizes the future guidance.    General  Question 3. What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these principles  into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with financial  institutions to understand those challenges?    As stated above, due to a lack of a common consensus on methodologies and monitoring/reporting metrics, our  member banks have been trying to explore how to develop a management framework on climate-related  financial risks. Other challenges include a limitation on data for analysis and the establishment of a data system  infrastructure. Therefore, we would appreciate it if public sectors and private sectors could jointly address these  challenges, and we would like the FDIC to consider providing sufficient time for the development of a risk  management framework by financial institutions.    Current Risk Management Practices  Question 5. What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to successfully  incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks?    For example, some member banks are using and developing the Risk Appetite Framework and quantitative  metrics (KPIs/KRIs) and scenario analysis on credit risk and market risk. They have disclosed the impact of  transition risks and physical risks in the risk management area in their annual report and sustainability report  aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.    Question 6. How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial risks are  material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?    Some member banks have developed and implemented a sound process for understanding and assessing climate- related financial risks. For example, one member bank has recognized climate-related risks as top risks in its  existing risk management framework, and regularly reported the financial impact of climate-related risks to the  Risk Management Committee under the control of the Board of Directors and the Risk Management Committee  and the Investment and Finance Committee, which are the committees of the Executive Committee. 
  4  It has also put in place a global and group framework where the chief risk officers in its group companies can  share and discuss measures to address climate-related risks.    Question 7. What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and  assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?    A clear common view of which time horizon is relevant has not been established, as they are still under  consideration globally. For example, when incorporating climate-related financial risks into existing  frameworks, such as credit ratings, consideration of different time horizons has not reached an international  consensus. The future FDIC guidance should allow for appropriate, risk-based flexibility across its supervisory  expectations (e.g., scenario analysis and strategic planning) to account for significant variability over longer  time horizons.    In addition, although it is necessary to measure long-term risks, it is very difficult to predict how society as a  whole will transition to a low-carbon economy or how each corporate will change its business in the long-term.  It should be noted that when and how much risk appears depend on the assumptions and presumptions by each  financial institution, and therefore it is the variation in measurement might be large. Therefore, we would like  international standard setting bodies and jurisdictional supervisors to clarify the concept of the time horizon for  measurement as much as possible, recognizing the need to balance these expectations with each financial  institution's discretion to make its own risk-based determinations.    Question 8. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies–for example, insurance  or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments–do financial institutions use to  hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks?    For project finance transactions, in general, physical damage from climate change (e.g. earthquake, flood,  windstorm, etc.) is mitigated through insurance.    Question 9. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services–for example, “green  bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate- related considerations into account–do financial institutions offer to clients and customers?  What risks, if any, do these products or services pose?    For example, our member banks provide the following products:  (i) Green loans, a loan product that finances eligible green projects such as investment in solar or wind power.   (ii) Social loans, a loan product that finances eligible social projects such as investment in the operation of  hospitals or affordable housing. Social loans can be utilized for climate change adaptation through projects  related to disaster response and preparedness.  (iii) Sustainability loans, a loan product that is a combination of social and green projects as described above.  (iv) Sustainability-linked loans (SLL), a loan product that sets sustainability performance targets (SPT) based  on a customer’s ESG strategy. The terms of the loan change depending on the achievement of the target.  SLLs can take climate related considerations into account when the SPT is related to climate change  mitigation or adaptation.  (v) Transition loans, a loan product that supports the transition of corporations from high to low GHG  emissions if the corporation has a transparent transition strategy (including targets) and appropriate  governance structure to support that transition.  (vi) Positive impact finance (PIF), a loan product that evaluates the social, environmental, and economic impact  of a corporation’s business and evaluates whether or not the corporation is working to increase its key  positive impacts and reduce its key negative impacts. Both positive and negative impact areas can be related  to climate change.    Most of the above products are provided in alignment with existing principles provided by the International  Capital Markets Association (ICMA), Loan Market Association (LMA), or United Nations Environment  Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI).   
  5  Question 10. How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate-related  financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities,  specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Should the agencies modify existing  regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act,  to address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged  communities?    We agree that it is important for financial institutions to take into account the impact of climate-related financial  risks on LMI and other disadvantaged households and communities. We would seek further clarification on the  FDIC’s expectations in this area.    Data, Disclosures, and Reporting  Question 11. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models from  borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure, monitor,  and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial institutions currently  obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data,  metrics, tools, or models?    Our member banks obtain specific data, such as climate-related variables, industry-specific variables, and the  amount of GHG emissions of individual firms, from vendors and public databases. A major concern with respect  to such data, metrics, tools, or models is the gap between firms’ disclosures/strategies and the results of scenario  analysis.  As an example, financial institutions recognize that carbon footprint is a useful source of information for their  decision-making, as well as communication with stakeholders (e.g. investors). Therefore, financial institutions  would like to estimate CO2/GHG emissions from their portfolio as soon as possible.  On the other hand, there are still many companies that do not collect or disclose their carbon footprint (Scope  1, 2 and 3). We also recognize that global standards for estimating carbon footprint have not yet been established.  So, the current situation is that each financial institution is still conducting research for the introduction of  standardized or consistent data. In such a situation, it is true that accurate risk measurement is difficult.  The above-mentioned challenges could be solved by (i) the standardization of metrics related to carbon footprint  measurement and/or (ii) the disclosure of carbon footprint reference data for each sector by  governments/regulators. We would like to ask the FDIC to continue to coordinate with international standard  setting bodies and jurisdictional supervisors to standardize metrics and/or to encourage governments to disclose  relevant data, as these activities are expected to boost disclosures for financial institutions.    Also, in order to obtain detailed output through scenario analysis, etc., elaborate management plans (for example,  how to deal with climate-related risks) of corporate clients are required from the perspective of understanding  long-term transition risks. Since the collection of these plans is likely to be very burdensome and time- consuming, we would like to ask for flexibility on the scope of risk measurement (for example, which industries  or sectors should be targeted for risk measurement, etc.).    We need a consistent and common understanding (measurement or methodology) for a transmission channel  from the risk driver of climate-related financial risks, although we understand that the BCBS report published  in April 20214 mentions the transmission relationship. A common approach would bring about enormous  benefits, such as accelerating the risk assessment process in financial institutions and allowing comparison and  benchmarking across the global financial system.    Question 12. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better  capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?    We would like the FDIC to leverage existing regulatory reporting requirements. Existing securities regulatory  disclosure regimes need to be leveraged regarding financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial                                                   4 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels  https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf 
  6  risks.    Scenario Analysis  Question 13. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that  requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial institutions  use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face?    Standardized climate scenarios are used to analyse the climate impact on borrowers’ financial statements, and  any missing variables are obtained from other sources. It is difficult to set assumptions regarding possible  technological developments and the investments of each firm based on such developments, and there is a limit  to incorporating firm-specific factors into the analysis.    At present, we understand that there is no established methodology for quantifying climate-related risks, such  as a VaR measure. It will take time to develop agreed-upon standards and methodologies.    Question 14. What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and  executing scenario analysis exercises?    We would like the FDIC to consider that uncertainties both in climate-related variables and macroeconomic  variables will increase as the time horizon becomes longer. Therefore, due care would be required when  analysing the results of scenario analysis.    In all risk area, where standard practices have not been established, the direction of quantification methodologies  for executing scenario analysis exercises needs to be indicated.    As proposed in Recommendation 4.4 of the “Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk” published in October  2021 by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)5, we agree to using existing common scenarios, such  as scenarios developed by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System  (NGFS), and therefore it would not be necessary for the FDIC to develop its own scenarios.

2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-031,"1  Finance Watch comments the on Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation Statement of Principles for Climate-Related  Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions    Opening Comment  Finance Watch welcomes the FDIC work on the principles for climate-related financial risk  management, which recognizes the challenges faced by banks and supervisors alike in this  area. However, our feedback outlines that principles-based guidance for supervisors and  financial institutions will not be sufficient to achieve timely and impactful outcomes in managing  climate-related financial risks of financial institutions. In addition to the principles, further  measures are needed, taking a precautionary approach to tackling these risks. This can and  should be done as part of the holistic review of bank prudential regulation and priority should  be given to the concrete, impactful and immediately feasible measures. Detailed points on  addressing climate-related financial risks can be found in our recent report “A silver bullet  against green swans”.1    A. Applicability  Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business  model, should inform financial institutions’ adoption of these principles?    The principles should be adopted with as large a scope as possible, given the financial  implications of climate change for all financial institutions. There can still be significant  implications from financial institutions of smaller sizes on customers and for the economy if  they are not properly managing climate-related financial risks. Whilst smaller financial  institutions may not pose the same systemic level of risk on their own, impacts from climate- related financial risks will be materializing at similar times for all banks and could make a  collective of smaller banks very systemically significant. Furthermore, in order to ensure  customer/depositor protection, all financial institutions should be obliged to run sound risk  identification and management processes.      As financial institutions have both micro and macro level exposure to climate-related financial  risks, it is important to ensure wide application of the principles. There is otherwise a potential  for large financial institutions to reduce micro-prudential risks, but for these risks to still be  systemic through macro level exposure in case risk reduction happens through “offloading” the  risks to other financial institutions or state entities without risk reduction at the systemic level.     An example would be the financing or insuring of the fossil fuel sector. This sector exposes  financial institutions to high transition risk at a micro level. Financing and ensuring the sector  also accelerates climate change. This increases exposure to physical risk at a macro level.                                                      1 Symon, Julia, A silver bullet against green swans: Incorporating climate-related financial risk into  bank and insurance prudential rules, November 2021. 
  2    B. Tailoring  Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its  climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size,  complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations?    Whilst developing future guidance on proportionate risk management practices will be  important, what is most urgently needed is federal level regulation to ensure that financial  institutions take a holistic approach to integrating climate-related financial risk. An underlying  principle for the assessment of proportionality must be to ensure that risk is still properly  managed and not to create a deregulatory agenda that transfers risk to clients or citizens to  reduce administrative burden. The FDIC should use its role on the FSOC Board to recommend  upgrading existing regulation to explicitly address climate-related financial risk.     Given the global nature of climate change, its impact and the interconnectedness of financial  markets, international coordination on minimum regulatory and supervisory requirements is  also both justified and needed.      C. General  Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft  principles into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage  with financial institutions to understand those challenges?    Climate-related financial risks have specific features, which pose significant challenges when  it comes to deploying existing prudential tools and approaches to tackle them.2 Specifically:    -  Disruption risk: Climate-related events are defined as “green swans” and have specific  features, which makes them impossible to predict and model. In particular, green swans  are characterized by: i) certainty of their occurrence despite highly uncertain impacts  and the impossibility to determine the exact timing of their materialization; ii) wide- ranging and existential impacts on the economy and the financial system; iii) a high  degree of complexity, including cascade effects and chain reactions in the environment,  economy and society.  -  Probabilities of climate-related events not reflected in past data: Traditional risk  modeling based on historical data is not possible as we are dealing with a forward- looking phenomenon, for which no past data can be used reliably to extrapolate the  future. By definition, when the data eventually arrives, it will be too late to avert a global  climate change-induced financial crisis.  -  Growing risk with prolonged inaction: The magnitude and probability of climate change  materialization are increasing as long as no tangible actions are taken to reduce                                                   2 BIS, BdF – P.

  3  greenhouse gas emissions. Once global temperatures have exceeded their pre- industrial level by 2°C, the consequences on human society and the global economy  will be irreversible and largely unpredictable.  -  The time horizon of climate-related financial risks materialization can be significantly  longer than the horizon of the current business forecasting, planning and risk  management frameworks. This poses additional challenges for financial institutions to  appropriately incorporate climate-related financial risks into management practices.   -  Environmental stability, including climate, is by nature a public good, which comes at  no cost to private agents. Coupled with the long materialization horizons of climate- related financial risks, this means that businesses and financial institutions do not have  incentives to consider the implications of their activities for the environment/climate.  Looking after public good is the mission of governments/regulators, not private agents.     Due to these specific features of climate-related financial risks, no credible methodologies or  tools have been developed yet to accurately identify and assess or measure these risks. The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published two reports in April 2021 outlining  numerous challenges and conceptual issues related to climate risk measurement and  methodologies. The most notable of these include the specific features of climate-related  financial risks (as was mentioned in Section 2 above), data gaps, difficulties to translate  climate-related events into financial impacts on institutions’ portfolios (climate risk drivers and  transmission channels).      Question 4: Would regulations or guidelines prescribing particular risk management  practices be helpful to financial institutions as they adjust to doing business in a  changing climate?    As outlined in the response to question 2, a holistic regulatory approach to integrating climate- related financial risk should be taken. This should include adjusting capital requirements for  sectors that are proven to pose high transition risk due to asset stranding as countries move  towards their climate commitments/objectives. The clear starting point here is the fossil fuel  sector, where the scientific case on their impact on climate change and risk of stranded assets  has been clearly made, including in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) report.3 This provides sufficient evidence and justification to realign capital treatment  of fossil fuel assets, to treat them as posing the highest levels of risk under existing regulatory  frameworks. Differentiation should be made between exposures to existing fossil fuel reserves,  as the assets associated with those will increasingly depreciate as reaching net zero by 2050  requires pre-determined reductions in the fossil fuel consumption; and exposures to new fossil  fuel exploration and expansion of the existing reserves, as there is no room for those activities  on the net zero trajectory.4  Based on this logic, fossil fuel related exposures should be either  subject to the highest credit risk capital charges under the existing prudential rules (exposures                                                   3 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, the Working  Group III contribution, 4 April 2022.   4International Energy Agency (IEA), Net Zero by 2050, A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, Flagship Report  – May 2021; IEA, World Energy Outlook 2021, October 2021. 
  4  to existing reserves) or to full equity funding requirement (exposures to reserve expansion and  exploration; this equates to 1250% credit risk weight under the Basel framework).  The same logic should be applied and expanded where possible to other sectors posing proven  high levels of climate-related financial risk based on the objectives of transition.     In addition, financial institutions should be required to undertake transition planning, as a risk  management process, which should include setting transition objectives and intermediate  targets. Transition plans and progress to achieving the targets they work towards should be  monitored and assessed as part of supervisory review processes. In addition, financial  institutions should set sustainability targets that are linked to the variable remuneration of  directors. This would ensure a more comprehensive approach to integrating climate-related  financial risk into risk management processes.       D. Current Risk Management Practices  Question 5: What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to  successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management  frameworks?  So far the approaches taken by financial institutions to incorporate climate-related financial risk  have been limited. The current high levels of financial performance of the sectors such as fossil  fuels (which are due, among others, to the fact that financial agents are not able to properly  price climate-related financial risks, as well as inherent short-termism of financial markets),  combined with limited political action to address climate change lead financial institutions to  focus on shorter term gains. This relies on a brinkmanship approach, where these financial  institutions hope to be able to divest and quickly adapt when transition risk or physical risk  materialize. The danger lies in the unpredictable, accelerating and irreversible nature of climate  change, which cannot be accurately modeled as things stand. This leaves financial institutions  with a limited view to the horizon and an incentive to try to extract short term profits from activity  that increases risk at both a micro and macro level.      In addition, internal and external credit ratings for fossil fuel assets do not take into account  transition, physical or disruption risk, meaning that there is an effective risk subsidy in place.  Capital requirements cannot be properly calibrated to cover the risk in this case, unless specific  updates to existing prudential rules are introduced. Until this underlying issue is dealt with,  other measures unfortunately are closer to window-dressing than risk management.    This conclusion is supported by the results of the European Central Bank (ECB) assessment  of the banks’ current progress on Pillar II measures, whereby the ECB has concluded that  banks’ current practices fall short of supervisory expectations.5 Banks were found to be “not  yet in a position to identify, manage and monitor [climate and environmental] risks at  counterparty level”. Also the banks’ plans to set a framework for climate management do not                                                   5 ECB Guide on climate-related and environmental risks setting supervisory expectations relating to  risk management and disclosure has been in place since November 2020. 
  5  yet ensure that most banks can properly manage these risks.6 The study by BlackRock  Financial Markets Advisory on “Development of tools and mechanisms for the integration of  Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) factors into the EU banking prudential  framework and into banks' business strategies and investment policies” also concluded that  “integration of ESG within banks’ risk management and investment practices, as well as  prudential supervision, is at an early stage” and “needs to be accelerated”.7      Question 6: How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial risks  are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?    Operationalization of the traditional guidance on materiality assessment represents a major  issue in the case of climate-related financial risks, as there is significant level of uncertainty  associated with climate-related risks, insufficient availability, as well as standardization and  consistency of data with which to analyze and measure these risks. Transmission channels  between climate events and financial implications for the balance sheets of affected institutions  require further exploration before these are fully understood.     The fact that the FDIC considers only financial materiality is a significant gap in its approach  to the interaction between climate change and financial institutions. Financial materiality is of  course essential, but when it comes to climate change financial materiality is fed by  environmental materiality. In other words, attempting to address financial materiality without  addressing environmental materiality is tantamount to deciding to ignore the root causes of  climate-related financial risks. A doom loop exists by which financial institutions, and in  particular banking institutions, make climate change possible by providing financing to the  fossil fuel industry, which is at the source of the bulk of CO2 emissions. At the same time,  financial institutions are themselves threatened by climate change. The lack of consideration  of the double materiality approach by the FDIC hinders its ability to develop appropriate policies  to tackle the vicious circle between climate change-enhancing financing and risks that it  represents to the financial institutions.      Question 8: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies—for example,  insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments—do financial  institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks?     It is important to note here that while financial institutions might be able to use certain strategies  to hedge or transfer risks on an individual level, from the systemic perspective the risk is not  reduced as long as climate change is not abated globally. A financial institution with a  satisfactory carbon balance does not mean that its climate risk is reduced. This risk is systemic                                                   6 ECB, The clock is ticking for banks to manage climate and environmental risks, Supervision  Newsletter, 18 August 2021.  7 BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory, Development of tools and mechanisms for the integration of  ESG factors into the EU banking prudential framework and into banks' business strategies and  investment policies, Final Study, May 2021 (published 27 August 2021); Executive Summary, p. 3, 7. 
  6  in nature and is only reduced by the sum of the individual and combined actions of all financial  and economic actors and at the same time. This is why coordinated actions of international  supervisors and public authorities in all jurisdictions are fundamental.      Question 9: What, if any, climate-related financial products or services— for example,  ‘‘green bonds,’’ derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take  climate-related considerations into account—do financial institutions offer to clients  and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose?    There is a significant risk of greenwashing and risk-washing with existing products and  services. A first key issue is that the current definitions of sustainable are questionable and  mostly unregulated. This can lead to them being very broad and not necessarily having any  measurable positive impact on climate change mitigation or adaptation that could be  considered as risk mitigating. This is not to speak to the intentions behind the efforts that take  place around the creation of sustainable definitions, but rather simply to their robustness for  risk measurement purposes.     ESG ratings of financial instruments and entities, which have become wide-spread suffer from  a number of drawbacks such as lack of transparency around the data and methodologies they  use, lack of clarity around their scope and purpose (e.g. if these rating capture only ESG risks,  which are financially material, or also ESG impacts, which might not be material to the risk  profile of the entity/instrument immediately, but might contribute to the risks in the system),  lack of data verification/validation and reliance on the data provided by the entities themselves.  As a result, there is a significant gap between what is assessed by ESG ratings and data  products and what is assumed (or implied) to be assessed, or what should be assessed in  order to improve investors’ contribution to achieving climate change mitigation in line with the  Paris climate commitments.    A further key issue is over the capacity of certain financial instruments to have an impact on  the real economy. Some financial instruments follow financial performance and exist as  ‘synthetic’ products without any capacity to directly impact economic activity. They are not  capable of having a positive impact of climate change that could be considered as risk  mitigating.    For the key reasons outlined above there is a real issue over potential risk-washing where  greenwashing (intentional or not) is taking place.       E. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting  Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models from  borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure,  monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial  institutions currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there  with respect to these data, metrics, tools or models? 
  7    There is currently a significant lack of data and climate models and metrics are still very much  under development. There are too many uncertainties over exactly when and how the impacts  of climate change will materialize. This means it is still not possible to quantify climate-related  financial risks. The process of properly developing these models, metrics, tools, developing  indicators and collecting data should continue to try and reach this goal with the degree of  accuracy possible, whilst realizing that due to the specific features of climate-related financial  risks, as outlined above, modeling these risks will likely never be possible with sufficient degree  of precision.    Data provided by ESG rating and data providers are increasingly being used as a source of  climate-related information. However, the challenges, which we mentioned in the response to  Question 10, contribute to opacity of the ESG ratings, which is compounded by the lack of  standardization and consistency of underlying data, for which no established accounting  standards are yet in place (in contrast to information from firms’ financial statements that  informs credit ratings). In its report “The Availability of Data with Which to Monitor and Assess  Climate-Related Risks to Financial Stability”, the Financial Stability Board warned against  using the ESG ratings as a source of climate-related information at this stage.8 This suggests  a need to accelerate international work on establishing possibly aligned data definitions and  metrics for the ESG, in particular climate-related data.     In the meantime, action is needed to address the absolute and scientifically asserted certainty  that climate change is and will have devastating impacts that will either require or force  significant changes to financial markets and economies. Either through a managed transition  or disruption as a result of climate change-related events. This certainty must form the basis  for taking regulatory action to ensure that climate-related financial risks are not threatening  financial stability and creating a pocket of untreated risk.      Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to  better capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?    Financial institutions can have an important role in the transition to a more sustainable  economy. They can use this role to mitigate their own exposure to transition risk, as well as in  turn reduce activities that contribute negatively to climate change. By extension this then  mitigates physical and disruption risks. Some large financial institutions are already starting to  make public commitments to divest from fossil fuels that do not start actively planning and  proving that they are transitioning.     There is an implied role for supervisors here to ensure the standardization and validity of  information relevant to financial markets provided by financial institutions. This role should  become more explicit and give supervisors an active mandate to set science-based standards                                                   8 FSB, The Availability of Data with Which to Monitor and Assess Climate-Related Risks to Financial  Stability, 7 July 2021. 
  8  and methodologies for alignment of financial institutions´ portfolios with the Paris agreement  goals, transition pathways towards these goals and monitor their implementation, to ensure  that financial institutions set credible transition goals and stick to them. Please also refer to the  response to question 4 here.     There is also a need to move towards internationally aligned standards on sustainability- related disclosures. The work of the ISSB, the SEC and the EFRAG will not be effective if each  jurisdiction creates different and incompatible frameworks. The starting point for standards  must take a double materiality approach as a basis for creating comparable information and a  common set of definitions and recognized metrics. Properly aligned standards would ensure  that the sustainability-related information needed for transition planning is available and that  disclosures are as meaningful as possible. This in turn is important to ensuring that transition  plans and sustainability targets are integrated into risk management processes.       F. Scenario Analysis  Question 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management  that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial  institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they  face?    Please see our response to Question 14.      Question 14: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and  executing scenario analysis exercises?    The world’s leading supervisors have put a lot of value on climate “stress tests” as a tool to  identify and manage climate-related financial risks across the financial system. These stress  tests have effectively been scenario analysis exercises so far. The results of these exercises  do offer valuable insights into the climate-risks of financial institutions and potential channels  and effects of their materialization. These insights in turn help shape supervisors’ actions and  also raise awareness among financial institutions to enhance their risk management practices  and adapt business models. However, there are significant limitations to the so-called “stress  tests”, which can be found in Finance Watch’s report “A silver bullet against green swans”.9    A fundamental point that needs to be further explored is the transmission channels between  climate events and financial implications for the balance sheets/capital of affected institutions.  As the BCBS report from April 2021 highlighted, “Existing analysis does not generally translate  changes in climate-related variables into changes in banks’ credit, market, liquidity or  operational risk exposures or bank balance sheet losses. Instead, the focus is on how specific  climate risk drivers can impact narrowly defined sectors of particular economies, individual                                                   9 Symon, Julia, A silver bullet against green swans: Incorporating climate-related financial risk into  bank and insurance prudential rules, November 2021. 
  9  markets, or top-down assessments of the macro economy as a whole”.10 The report concludes  that significant further research and empirical evidence are required. The European Banking  Authority (EBA) pilot exercise on identifying and mapping climate risks in the banks’ portfolios  reached similar conclusions.11     A key issue is that existing scenarios do not take into account the feedback loop, i.e. the impact  which the financial sector itself has on transition and climate developments. There can be  scenarios where the financial system plays a hampering role in transition so that the resulting  impacts of scenarios (risks) might be underestimated. The ECB has made progress to  overcome some of those challenges in its EU-wide stress test exercise; however, the ECB also  outlined that a significant amount of work is yet to be undertaken towards “a comprehensive  climate stress-testing framework”.12 The limitations of climate scenario exercises were  confirmed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) based on the experience  of 30 central banks and supervisors across the world.13    Importantly, “stress tests” have not yet led to and were not even intended to lead to conclusions  about the capital adequacy of the financial institutions assessed. Therefore, these “stress  tests” should be regarded as pilot exercises of exploratory nature. So far, only the ECB has  considered the possibility of imposing qualitative or quantitative requirements on a case-by- case basis on the results of its supervisory review.                                                       10 BCBS, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels, April 2021, p. 2.  11 EBA, Mapping climate risk: Main findings from the EU-wide pilot exercise, 21 May 2021.   12 S. Alogoskoufis, N. Dunz et al, ECB economy-wide climate stress test: Methodology and results,  ECB Occasional Paper Series, No 281, September 2021, p. 64-67. Some of the most notable of  advancements have been the following: i) analysis of banks´ credit and market portfolios at exposure  level, thus accounting for firm-specific vulnerabilities to climate risk factors; ii) capturing key  transmission channels of climate risks by means of employing models specifically developed for the  exercise; iii) analysis of the interactions between physical and transmission risks. Yet, with reference  to the identified limitations, the following avenues of future work have been outlined in the ECB report:  i) modeling of the banks’ endogenous reactions and their feedback loop to real economy; ii)  consideration of additional physical risk hazards; iii) inclusion of additional sets of bank portfolios such  as retail portfolio, which could not be considered due to lack of sufficient data or of sufficient  granularity; iv) modeling contagion dynamics in the financing sector that could amplify the impact of  climate risks.   13 NGFS, Scenarios in Action: A progress report on global supervisory and central bank climate  scenario exercises, Technical document, October 2021.","Finance Watch welcomes the FDIC's principles for climate-related financial risk management but argues that principles alone are insufficient. They advocate for a precautionary approach and additional measures to manage these risks effectively. Finance Watch emphasizes the need for broad applicability of the principles to all financial institutions, regardless of size, due to the systemic nature of climate risks. They call for federal regulation and international coordination to ensure comprehensive risk management. Challenges include the unpredictability of climate events, lack of historical data for modeling, and the need for a holistic regulatory approach. Finance Watch also highlights the risk of greenwashing in financial products and the importance of standardized, science-based data and metrics. They stress the need for financial institutions to integrate climate risks into their management practices and for regulatory bodies to enforce these standards. Scenario analysis and stress tests are seen as valuable but limited tools, requiring further development to assess the financial implications of climate events accurately."

Gruenberg  Acting Chairman  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street, NW  Washington, D.C. 20429  Acting Chairman Gruenberg,    Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) April 4, 2022,  Request for Comment on its draft principles for managing exposures to climate-related financial risks. We commend  the FDIC for taking proactive steps to assess climate-related financial risks, and for engaging with finance industry  participants (through mechanisms such as this request) as you consider plans for future action.    At CoreLogic, property data - spanning single family residential, multifamily residential, and commercial - is our DNA.  We provide real estate professionals, financial institutions, insurance carriers, government agencies, and other  housing market participants with reliable, property-level data, analytics, and platforms that deliver the most  qualified, comprehensive information available. We couple this with the country’s most extensive network of field  researchers, analysts, and data scientists to curate, connect, and uniquely enrich this property data with further  insightful intelligence, particularly climate-related financial risks. CoreLogic is connected at almost every step of  both the insurance and mortgage production process and has the insights necessary to help the FDIC and other  federal agencies implement and evaluate a strategy to tackle financial risks stemming from climate change.    Our wealth of property data, analytical capabilities, and connectivity throughout the financial ecosystem  places CoreLogic in the best position to holistically evaluate the physical risks of climate change and the  potential impacts to financial institutions, markets, and systemic risk.    The following pages will provide you with best practices that we suggest FDIC consider in its regulatory framework  when guiding institutions on reliably assessing the physical risk of damages to property and infrastructure.  Importantly, our comment will also suggest mechanisms for how institutions can forecast varying climate change  scenarios and their projected severities, including how these scenarios may alter property-level, physical risk profiles  in the years and decades to come.    Thus, we believe the FDIC and the financial industry at large will benefit greatly from an approach that utilizes a  currently available, market-tested business intelligence platform, which combines the best of commercially  available, open source, public, and other government proprietary data, analytics, and models, enabling them to  answer any number of pressing policy questions, including which communities are most vulnerable to the effects of  climate change.     Our team of scientists, economists, and public policy experts would welcome the opportunity to brief the FDIC staff  on the information contained in this response. We look forward to continued conversations with your office as we all  work collaboratively to protect our financial system from climate-related risks.      Sincerely,   Pete Carroll  Executive, Head of Public Policy & Industry Relations  Direct: 202.276.6295       Email: pcarroll@corelogic.com 
    1      NOTES ON RESPONSE OUTLINE    In our response, we address each of the six general principles that FDIC has identified as integral to their  eventual rulemaking:    A. Governance  B. Policies, Procedures, and Limits  C. Strategic Planning  D. Risk Management  E. Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting  F. Scenario Analysis However, in outlining the necessary steps that need to be taken by the FDIC – and other federal regulators –  we have addressed the FDIC’s specific questions in our own order, organizing our responses to better reflect  our prioritization of these actions.     As such, we first dive into the specific data & analytical capabilities that are necessary to measure and report  climate-related financial risks. This leads directly into our discussion of scenario analyses and risk  management practices. Once the data & analytical capabilities have been identified and addressed, we then  begin to discuss proper ways to oversee this accumulation and assessment of data (governance), as well as  suggestions for certain policies and procedures that can minimize the burden to financial institutions’  strategic planning processes.            
    2    E. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting  Climate change introduces two facets of risk to an institution:    1. Physical risk to their assets due to climate shifts such as rising sea levels and changing weather  patterns and volatility.    2. Transition risk causing a loss of value of the investments in sectors (such as Oil, Gas and Coal) in which  they are invested.      At CoreLogic, our focus on the first of these two prongs – physical risk – has led us to develop a unique  understanding of the specific data sets and analytical capabilities that will be required by the financial sector  to both measure and assess overall climate-related financial risk.     The first step is to establish a baseline of the current risk profiles for all physical structures across the United  States.      Establishing a Baseline of Physical Risk    Climate risks are high-gradient perils that can change over short distances, making them wide-reaching yet  still acutely felt.     To understand these disparities, current and future risk data on numerous natural hazards – such as flood,  wind, wildfire, and more – is needed for each individual structure. This is key: despite the fact that many areas  in the U.S. are exposed to multiple natural hazards, the industry has historically reviewed these hazards  individually. Although insightful, this does not provide an accurate risk measurement for structures that are  impacted by multiple hazards. Instead, we need structure-specific, integrated hazard risk scores. The goal of  an integrated hazard risk score is to represent the total hazard risk for any location across the U.S.     Because many property-and-casualty insurance companies and enterprise risk managers are already looking  for a single score to reflect the combined risk of all natural hazards that affect their portfolio, CoreLogic  created such a model that combines our existing natural hazard datasets into a comprehensive single hazard  score. In our experience, these such models should incorporate, at a minimum, the following hazard risks:      Earthquake    Wildfire    Inland Flood    Severe Convective Storm    Winter Storm    Hurricane/Tropical Storm Surge    Hurricane/Tropical Storm Wind    To create these scores, we utilized risk modeling to combine the severity and frequency of damage into a  composite risk score, which represents the sum of the Annual Adjusted Loss (AAL) for the seven individual  hazards mentioned above for approximately 105 million residential structures across the U.S. The value of  this composite AAL, relative to the calculated Reconstruction Cost Value (RCV), is used to rank all structures  with a 1-100 score, where the higher scores equate to higher risks. When combined with our innovative  Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models from  borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure, monitor,  and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial institutions currently  obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data,  metrics, tools or models? 
    3    Hazard-Effected Loan Performance (HELP) models, which correlate the property’s composite natural hazard  risk score to a probability of mortgage loan delinquency, default, and economic loss severity, these climate- related financial risk analytics can be used not only in property and casualty insurance markets, but also in  the housing finance ecosystem (primary and secondary), by investors in residential mortgage-backed  securities (RMBS), asset-backed securities (ABS), and credit risk transfers/other financial risk derivatives, and  by financial services prudential regulators for supervisory stress testing and oversight, as well as by publicly  traded companies preparing materiality disclosures in Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC  filings. The AAL for the seven individual perils mentioned above and the composite AAL is calculated using our  high definition Catastrophe Risk Models conditioned with today’s climate.    Additionally, these composite scores can be represented in a composite risk map to identify the areas with  the highest risk homes. The map below illustrates risk levels across the country, showing that the highest risk  homes are in California (dominated by earthquake and wildfire); Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska  (dominated by tornado/hail); along the Mississippi River (dominated by river flooding and earthquake risk);  and large Gulf and Atlantic coastal stretches (dominated by hurricane winds and storm surge/riverine  flooding).      CoreLogic 2020 Climate Change Catastrophe Reporti        Catastrophe modeling and property risk analysis are paramount to accurately predicting, down to a parcel  and structure(s) level, the damages that could occur. Institutions can model large-scale financial needs (for  example, ensuring adequate capital reserves) using composite risk scores for a certain portfolio or area to  understand their AAL. The insurance industry has already begun to adapt to climate change evolving in the  way they protect homeownership and property, offering new insurance options and transformational  experiences that better suit today’s reality of risk and policyholder expectations.    With composite risk scores available across the United States, the second step is to get as granular as possible  with those assessments.            100  Risk Score  1  No Data 
    4    Achieving Granularity    There appears to be a perception within federal government that physical risk from climate change is already  well understood. We respectfully suggest that various agencies look deeper into the data and analytics – at  least with respect to reliable property-level physical risk assessments.     To reliably assess physical risk, one must be able to both identify the property itself and identify the specific  structure(s) on that property that require separate assessments. This identification requires  geospatial/location data that can reliably assess the geographical boundaries of a property and its  structure(s), along with rich data describing the attributes of the property’s parcel/land and the structure itself.  If the underlying location data is not accurate, assessments – such as AAL calculations – will not reflect the  true risk to the structure, as exemplified below.        Source: CoreLogic      These reliable assessments involve the use of models that are based on underlying data inputs that reliably  determine First Floor Height (FFH) Elevation (relative to sea level and ground level). They also require use of  reliable technology innovations: most notably Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology, which  employs an approach called Digital Elevation Monitoring (DEM) – the remote sensing technique used to  identify the 3-D footprint of the structure(s), its ground elevation, and height above sea level – as well as the  structure’s first floor height relative to the ground elevation and sea level, including the number of feet/inches  above ground or below ground relative to industry standard “safety” benchmarks.        Source: CoreLogic 
    5    The key to reliability is use of 1-meter resolution DEM, the level of granularity necessary to permit reliable  assessment of FFH elevation and related footprint data in any municipality that has relatively large population  centers, including exurbs, suburbs, and urban core. Using anything less – such as 10-meter or 30-meter  resolution DEM – in densely populated areas will not provide reliably accurate assessments for individual  households, as evidenced below.        Source: CoreLogic      Now that we’ve identified composite risk scores and achieved a structure-specific level of granularity, the next,  forward-looking step is to project future risk levels based on expected impacts from climate change.      CoreLogic has no additional comments regarding existing regulatory reporting requirements.    Our only recommendation is that, should FDIC choose to augment regulatory reporting requirements to  capture financial institutions exposure to climate-related financial risks, the FDIC follow an approach that  includes the following:       Using market-tested, industry-leading climate-related financial risk models and related data that  establish a baseline of the current risk profiles for all physical structures across the United States,  which should include granular, integrated hazard risk scores that consider a wide number of  potential perils, as well as average annual loss and reconstruction cost value estimates, which can  be combined with property/flood insurance coverage and loan-level performance data to ascertain  both collateral value and loan delinquency exposures.       If applicable, projecting future risk levels based on expected impacts from climate change, through  the use of industry leading tools that are market-tested in conjunction with data, technology, and  internationally recognized climate scenarios for stress testing catastrophe models.        Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better  capture financial institutions' exposure to climate-related financial risks? 
    6    F. Scenario Analysis  Climate Scenarios and Catastrophe Risk Models    The best way to measure climate-related financial risk is to use industry leading tools that are market-tested  in conjunction with data, technology, and internationally recognized climate scenarios to stress test climate  / catastrophe risk. CoreLogic recommends using catastrophic risk models informed by the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the leading world body for assessing the latest science related to climate  change, its impacts, and potential future risks.ii Composite risk scores that integrate IPCC climate scenarios  with market tested natural hazard modeling will give both financial institutions and the FDIC a clearer  understanding of the climate-related financial risks facing the industry.    Over the past decade, the IPCC has worked to create Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to model  prospective climate futures based on varying projected level of greenhouse gas concentration in our  atmosphere. These four pathways provide insight into potential rises in global temperature alongside a  number of additional consequences, such as rise in sea level. The IPCC 6th Assessment Report (due 2022) will  include five Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSPs) scenarios to model prospective climate futures based on  varying projected levels of greenhouse gas concentration in our atmosphere.            IPCC: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis, Summary for Policymakersiii  Question 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that  requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial institutions  use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face? 
    7    CoreLogic has taken these IPCC scenarios – which define the severity and frequency distributions of different  future climate parameters (e.g. global temperature, sea surface temperature, sea level rise, precipitation, etc.)  – and integrated them with our own suite of hazard risk data & high definition catastrophic probabilistic  models to produce climate change risk metrics for each RCP scenario down to the individual property level,  as exemplified by the case study below on Miami, Florida, where we calculated Average Annual Loss and  Probable Maximum Loss estimates across the different IPCC climate change scenarios.      CoreLogic Average Annual Loss and Probable Maximum Loss Estimates across Different Climate Change Scenarios        Climate Change Multi-Peril Risk Index for Every Building in Miami under 2021, 2030, and 2050 Climate Conditions          This figure above shows the multi-peril risk index for every building in Miami under today’s climate conditions  (left-most figure), as well as the projected conditions in the years 2030 and 2050 (center and right-most figures,  respectively). As we move from today’s climate conditions to the future projections, more buildings move  from green to yellow and from yellow to red as their risk profiles increase due to the effects of climate change.    As mentioned above, the IPCC expects to release an updated assessment report (‘Assessment Report 6’ or ‘AR  6’) in the first half of 2022. It is widely expected to be a significant update from the current assessment report  (AR 5), which was produced in 2014. In preparation for this update, CoreLogic is readying its platform to  incorporate the scenarios from AR 6 as soon as they are available. 
    8      Recommendation: In order to effectively measure the financial sector’s exposures to climate-related  financial risks, institutions and the FDIC will need access to granular, property-specific data and precise  location analytics to understand exposure down at the individual structure level, which can then be  aggregated to portfolio and geographic levels for more comprehensive and insightful analyses.    Recommendation: The FDIC will need to establish a baseline of current physical risks, which should be  collectively represented by a structure-specific composite risk score.    Recommendation: To best measure climate-related financial risk, the FDIC will need to use market- tested industry-leading tools in conjunction with data, technology, and internationally recognized  climate scenarios for stress testing catastrophe models, such as those used by the IPCC in their current  (and future) assessment reports.  In an effort to prevent another system-wide failure as experienced in the financial crisis of 2008-2009, banking  supervisors and governments around the world tightened regulatory standards – bringing stress testing to  the forefront.iv In general, stress tests are aimed at providing an overall assessment of a company’s current  risk position, the key drivers of that risk, and the main sensitivities of its portfolio.v     As such, stress tests are a constant topic in discussions surrounding climate-related financial risks. Appearing  before the Senate Banking Committee in mid-July of 2021, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the  U.S. central bank is looking into using climate stress scenarios to make banks more aware of and resilient to  ever-more-frequent severe weather events, specifically stating “My guess is that’s a direction we’ll go in”.vi A  couple of months later, in September 2021, a new study was published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York that offered a model for potential future stress tests on big banks for their exposure to risks from climate  change.vii viii Additionally, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) included a question on stress testing in  its January 2021 Request for Input on Climate and Natural Disaster Risk Management, asking if FHFA should  “implement a stress testing, scenario analysis, or similar program to assess the regulated entities’ climate and  natural disaster risk?”ix    If the FDIC decides to follow this same path, it may be beneficial to institute region-specific climate stress tests  that can be used by institutions across all geographic markets in the United States. Incorporating region- specificity into climate stress tests would be beneficial to both the regulator and those being regulated, as it  would allow both to separately analyze portfolios that may face differing types and levels of climate risk,  before combining those analyses to produce a nationwide assessment of risk. This level of granularity is  necessary due to the varying impacts of climate change across distinct regions of the United States, which  affect region-specific portfolios in distinct ways. Additionally, it would be beneficial for the FDIC to separately  engage with private sector third parties to evaluate the entire market’s economic loss potential for these  scenarios. The comparison of these two sources of data would help the FDIC assess both the quality and  completeness of industry exposures.    Recommendation: If the FDIC decides to implement climate stress tests for larger institutions, it should  consider instituting region-specific tests to allow for separate analysis of portfolios that may face  differing types and levels of climate risk.     Recommendation: If the FDIC decides to implement climate stress tests for larger institutions, it should  engage private sector third parties to evaluate the entire market’s economic loss potential for these  scenarios.     Question 14: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and  executing scenario analysis exercises? 
    9    D. Risk Management  Case Study: Current Mortgage Investor Practices    Banks, mortgage servicers, and capital markets investors are actually already assessing how climate change  has altered the physical risk profile to properties servicing as collateral to their mortgage loans and Mortgage  Servicing Rights (MSRs). Due to the current absence of new regulatory requirements, these entities are  approaching climate-related financial risks in a manner aligned with their existing risk management practices.    However, even the more proactive banks are still in the early stages – they are looking to understand and  quantify their climate risks, and CoreLogic is presently assisting them with the tools and techniques that we’ve  described throughout this response.     The figure below provides an example of merely one way mortgage investors are utilizing our composite  natural hazard scores and related data, analytics, models, and software tools. In this example, a large  commercial bank has engaged ten “sub-servicers” who provide performing and non-performing mortgage  servicing activities on the commercial bank’s behalf. For the first time, the commercial bank wanted to  evaluate how their sub-servicers were distributing natural hazard risk (i.e., current physical risk) across the  portfolio of MSRs they were responsible for. As noted in Figure 14, six of the sub-servicers were deemed to  have too heavy a concentration of natural hazard risk in the MSR book they are responsible for servicing, while  three servicers had a moderate concentration risk profile, and only one that was deemed to have an adequate  concentration risk profile. This insight was crucial to the commercial banks, who subsequently worked with  their sub-servicers to rebalance their respective MSR books under their respective purviews so that each of  them achieved a “green” (i.e., adequate concentration risk) rating.      Percentage of Loans in Servicer Portfolios by Composite Risk Score    Question 5: What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to successfully  incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks? 
    10      Moreover, once the commercial bank was able to establish the current physical risk baseline to the MSRs  across their book of business, as well as across the sub-servicers servicing those MSRs, the commercial bank  could apply future climate scenarios, using CoreLogic catastrophe modeling techniques, to assess how many  of the properties serving as collateral to the mortgage loans in the MSR book of business are at risk of having  Probable Maximum Loss (PML) exceeding 10% from the next 50 to 100 years as a result of future climate  change scenarios.        Consistent with the SEC climate-related financial risk Proposed Rule (RIN 3235-AM87), it generally makes  sense to leave the work of determining materiality of climate-related financial risks to the financial  institutions themselves. However, the FDIC can provide guidance that offers clarity to financial intuitions and  reduces their burden, while still promoting healthy corporate governance practices.     For example, a financial institution can use CoreLogic climate models to assess the current and future climate- related financial risk to their assets for which property serves as collateral (e.g., RMBS) or influences the health  of the asset (e.g., municipal bonds). With this quantitative assessment, financial institutions can decide how  to best incorporate these findings into assessments of how they may materially affect their financial condition,  as part of their existing corporate governance procedures.        Please refer back to our response to Question #13 above, where we discuss specific time horizons and  demonstrate how multiple climate change scenarios can be visually represented.                              Question 6: How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial risks are  material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?  Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and  assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? 
    11     We highlight the insurance industry again for what may be a helpful example for financial institutions and  regulators when considering disadvantaged and LMI communities.     The effect on availability and affordability when considering climate and financial risk mitigation strategies  and financial products should be viewed through a number of demographic lenses, most notably income and  race. Some areas are becoming more costly to insure but are still appealing (e.g., coastal properties).  Affordability is not the major concern here, as these homeowners tend to be higher-income individuals with  the ability to afford higher insurance costs for beachfront properties. Instead, insurance availability is the  greatest cause for concern. Many insurers may be unwilling to offer policies for expensive properties built in  high-risk areas.    That being said, there are still low-to-moderate income homeowners that live along the coast, residing in  poorer communities, and are less able to fortify their homes or absorb increasing insurance costs. These  homeowners are disproportionately people-of-color living in majority-minority communities. Efforts should  be made to identify these communities and homeowners (perhaps through an analysis of Reconstruction Cost  Values (RCVs) of homes within the community) and provide them with assistance. Comprehensive home-by- home analytics are available to enable this type of supervisory evaluation of communities at risk by relying on  data and analytics providers.    Recommendation: The FDIC should undergo an analysis of LMI and minority communities living in high- risk areas to quantify the total level of risk these communities face and the amount of federal/state  assistance that would need to be directed toward these communities to mitigate these risks.                Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate-related  financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities,  specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Should the agencies modify existing  regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act, to  address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged  communities? 
    12    A. Applicability  No additional comments.              Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model,  should inform financial institutions' adoption of these principles? 
    13    B. Tailoring  Please refer back to our response to Question #14 above, where we discuss region-specificity issues, which  could be implemented by financial institutions themselves when developing their own internal climate- related financial risk management practices.            Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its climate- related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile,  and scope of operations? 
    14    C. General  In order for the FDIC to assess and regulate climate-related risk in the financial sector, it must ensure that it is  receiving accurate, comparable, and actionable information from financial institutions, which brings us to a  key structural issue that must be addressed: standardization.    To understand the varying levels of risk that institutions face – and to rank-order the geographic  areas/institutions with the most exposure – the FDIC needs to receive comparable, standardized reports. The  current lack of a common reporting mechanism creates confusion for both financial institutions and the FDIC.  Institutions do not have a concrete understanding of the information that they need to include in their  supervisory reporting, leading them to potentially omit data that the FDIC considers material while including  data that is not applicable to the FDIC’s oversight authorities.     From the FDIC’s perspective, a common reporting structure is necessary to compare individual institution’s  risk exposure at a specific point in time to understand where the highest concentrations of risk exist. It is also  needed to accurately assess whether an institution is taking proactive steps to address their climate-related  risks over the course of multiple reporting periods.    Recommendation: The FDIC should take steps to standardize the reporting forms and data that it  collects from institutions, in order to accurately assess and manage climate-related financial risk.    The financial industry as a whole could learn important lessons from the insurance industry.     Insurance companies have been on the front lines of understanding, pricing, and mitigating the risk caused  by the increasing frequency and severity of natural hazard events due to climate change. CoreLogic works  hand-in-hand with the insurance industry – from underwriting to risk management to claims – to help families  and businesses protect their homes and properties. This protection starts with understanding risk, having the  latest and greatest underwriting tools and construction cost data, keeping close tabs on Mother Nature, and  being at the ready in a moment of loss.    Big data and technology are disrupting risk-assessment norms, and insurers are rethinking how they  fundamentally conceptualize risk itself. Traditionally, the focus was on the size or severity of claims—not the  probability that there would be a claim in the first place. This incomplete concept of risk affects market share  with insurers leaving potential profits on the table.     True disruption will come not from the most high-tech industry participants but from those who use data and  technology to get smarter about insurance risk assessment and mitigation, which we’ve seen from our clients  over the past several years.    Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft principles  into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with financial  institutions to understand those challenges?  Question 4: Would regulations or guidelines prescribing particular risk management practices  be helpful to financial institutions as they adjust to doing business in a changing climate? 
    15    Our clients in the insurance industry are monitoring the effects of climate change on catastrophe event  frequency and severity, relying largely on loss projection models and active event monitoring, and using these  to manage enterprise-level risk accumulations. To a limited extent, these are used to support pricing but are  somewhat limited due to lack of acceptance.    Additionally, many communities are embarking upon resilience efforts, but insurers are struggling to  incorporate these into their analytics. More effective resilience requires better cataloging of all community  resilience efforts (especially more uniform reporting), and improved auditing of mitigation plans to ensure  that the work was completed and is effective.    Recommendation: The FDIC should coordinate with the Treasury FIO and state insurance regulators to  the extent that FDIC wishes to provide guidance for financial institutions regarding the  consideration/evaluation of community resiliency efforts, the impact of those efforts on the overall risk  levels of their portfolios, and how those efforts may be viewed by insurers, among other transition- related risks.             
    16    Appendix A – Comprehensive List of Recommendations      F. Scenario Analysis    Recommendation: In order to effectively measure the financial sector’s exposures to climate-related  financial risks, institutions and the FDIC will need access to granular, property-specific data and precise  location analytics to understand exposure down at the individual structure level, which can then be  aggregated to portfolio and geographic levels for more comprehensive and insightful analyses.    Recommendation: The FDIC will need to establish a baseline of current physical risks, which should be  collectively represented by a structure-specific composite risk score.    Recommendation: To best measure climate-related financial risk, the FDIC will need to use market-tested  industry-leading tools in conjunction with data, technology, and internationally recognized climate  scenarios for stress testing catastrophe models, such as those used by the IPCC in their current (and future)  assessment reports.    Recommendation: If the FDIC decides to implement climate stress tests for larger institutions, it should  consider instituting region-specific tests to allow for separate analysis of portfolios that may face differing  types and levels of climate risk.     Recommendation: If the FDIC decides to implement climate stress tests for larger institutions, it should  engage private sector third parties to evaluate the entire market loss potential for these scenarios.       D. Risk Management    Recommendation: The FDIC should undergo an analysis of LMI and minority communities living in high-risk  areas to quantify the total level of risk these communities face and the amount of federal/state assistance  that needs to be directed toward these communities.      C. General    Recommendation: The FDIC should take steps to standardize the reporting forms and data that it collects  from institutions, in order to accurately assess and manage climate-related financial risk.    Recommendation: The FDIC should coordinate with the Treasury FIO and state insurance regulators to  provide guidance for financial institutions regarding the consideration/evaluation of community resiliency  efforts, the impact of those efforts on the overall risk levels of their portfolios, and how those efforts may be  viewed by insurers.

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention:  Comments—RIN 3064–ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429  Re: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions  Dear Mr. Sheesley,  Truist appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation’s (“FDIC”) draft Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions (“FDIC Proposal”)1 (RIN 3064– ZA32).  Truist  supports the FDIC’s efforts to develop principles-based guidance to assist financial institutions in  managing the possible impacts of physical- and transition-related risks associated with climate  change in a manner that is consistent with the existing risk management framework described in  the FDIC’s regulations and guidance.   Truist Financial Corporation is a purpose-driven financial services company committed  to inspiring and building better lives and communities. Truist has a leading market share in  many high-growth markets in the country, and offers a wide range of services including retail,  small business and commercial banking; asset management; capital markets; commercial real  estate; corporate and institutional banking; insurance; mortgage; payments; specialized  lending; and wealth management. Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Truist is a top  10 U.S. commercial bank with total assets of $544 billion as of March 31, 2022.      During 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, Truist continued to build, integrate, and  advance climate risk-related programs and initiatives across the enterprise.  This included    1   FDIC, Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions, 87 Fed.

    expanding its risk management teams and creating a dedicated climate risk management  function that seeks to identify and evaluate climate risks and opportunities, and to integrate  climate-related considerations into the Company’s risk management framework and strategic  plans.  We do this by developing business practices that protect and conserve natural resources  and reduce the carbon footprint of our own operations and that of our clients, as well as by  harnessing opportunities to invest in innovative new products, services, and partnerships in areas  such as renewable energy. Truist has also enhanced its climate-related reporting and  transparency.    Truist supports the development of principles-based guidance for climate-related  financial risk management. Truist further encourages the FDIC to continue coordinating with the  other bank regulatory agencies as well as broader governmental entities operating in this area to  ensure consistent requirements and supervisory expectations with respect to climate-related  financial risk management.   General Principles    Climate-related financial risks may impact financial institutions across the range of  traditional risk types and are likely to manifest in unique ways depending on each institution’s  size, complexity, operational footprint, business model, and strategy. The FDIC Proposal, in most  cases, establishes principles-based standards that allows FDIC-regulated banks to tailor their risk  management programs to the unique attributes of each institution.  As climate-related financial  risk management practices evolve and financial institutions develop processes to identify the  climate-related financial risk exposures from their business activities and operations, individual   banks should have the flexibility to tailor their risk management programs to address the unique  circumstances of each institution, including with respect to its size, business model, and client  portfolio.  Given the variances among FDIC-regulated banks’ size, geographic footprint, and  business models, the final guidance should clearly acknowledge that managing climate-related  financial risk should be risk-based and that “one size does not fit all.”     In addition, many FDIC-regulated banks are subject to regulation from other  governmental agencies, including prudential and financial market regulators, who are  contemplating or have proposed their own climate related requirements.  As the regulatory  landscape evolves, the opportunity for divergent regulatory frameworks grows rapidly absent  coordination among these governmental agencies.  Early analysis on the impact of climate- related financial risks suggests that the effects of climate risk can be observed through traditional 
    risk types.2  Given the interconnectedness of climate risk across risk types, it is imperative that  supervisory expectations for climate-related risk management are consistently developed and  applied, or banks may face the prospect of having to manage their climate-related financial risks  to differing regulatory standards, potentially requiring redundant and inconsistent compliance  requirements, resulting in increased costs and burden to the financial system as a whole without  corresponding benefits.  Governance     The proposed governance principles helpfully posit that the responsibility and  accountability for climate-related financial risk may be integrated within existing organizational  structures or by establishing new structures for climate-related financial risk.  Truist believes that  the flexibility this implies would allow institutions to properly design governance structures that  align with the way climate risks manifest within their institution.  However, the FDIC Proposal  also suggests that an institutions’ board of directors should have “an understanding of the  potential ways in which these risks could evolve over various time horizons and scenarios.”  Truist  believes the final guidance should recognize the complexity and uncertainty of planning over  longer time horizons, due to, among other things, the high number of scientific, macroeconomic,  financial, and other variables that can vary and must be taken into account when assessing  climate-related financial risk.  In addition, more quantitative and statistically-based aspects of  climate-risk management are in emerging stages, as many of the data points necessary to  accurately assess climate-related financial risk, even in the medium term, are simply unavailable  and there is substantial uncertainty with respect to the timing and scope of impacts of climate- related financial risk over medium- and longer-term time horizons.  Truist believes that  acknowledging that climate-related scenarios are less robust and predictable over long-time  horizons will encourage directors to obtain more information over longer time horizons and  enhance the usefulness of strategic planning over a longer time horizon.    Policies, Procedures, and Limits     Truist supports the proposal to incorporate climate-related risks into policies and  procedures to provide guidance on the institution’s approach to these risks that are in line with  the strategy and risk appetite set by the board of directors.  However, Truist does not believe  that it is appropriate to include formal “limits” for climate-related financial risks at this time.   Institutions should have the flexibility to assess their exposure to climate related risks, develop    2 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-related risk drivers and their transmission channels, Bank for  International Settlements,  https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf?msclkid=44a8db7bcff811ec85062206d907bb66 Accessed May 9, 2022 
    and inform their risk appetite and risk management frameworks prior to considering whether  any limits or thresholds would be appropriate.      The imposition of limits at this time could have unintended consequences, including  constraining the flow of capital and access to credit for certain industry segments and asset  classes, potentially exposing banks to additional legal and reputational risks.  Many energy- related firms seeking to transition away from higher-climate-risk activities will rely on financing  to achieve their business objectives, which very well could align with societal goals of reducing  climate-related risks.  Truist strives to serve its clients through their climate transition and the  imposition of arbitrary or premature limits could constrain Truist’s ability to do so.      Strategic Planning      Truist also supports the distinction between climate-related scenario analysis from  traditional stress testing exercises.  Truist agrees that scenario analysis can be an effective tool  in evaluating the resiliency of an institution’s strategy and risk management relative to the  structural changes arising from climate-related risks.  However, we believe the FDIC at the same  time should acknowledge that the relative immaturity of underlying data and methodologies may  limit the effectiveness of scenario analysis to accurately forecast potential impacts of climate  risks on a bank’s long-term strategy.      Risk Management    The proposal states that a financial institution should employ a comprehensive process  to identify emerging and material risks stemming from the institution’s business activities and  associated exposures.  While Truist agrees with the overall statement, we encourage the FDIC to  clarify that individual banks should develop a materiality standard for their use and application  in the risk appetite framework.  Truist believes that clarifying the meaning of “material” as  distinct from materiality in the context of securities laws provides banks with some comfort that  determinations made in the context of climate-risk management will not generate securities  liability.  Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting     Truist agrees that the climate-related financial risk information should be incorporated  into the institution’s internal risk reporting framework, including reporting, monitoring, and  escalation.  However, given the existing data challenges facing institutions, the extent of any  reporting should be commensurate with the capabilities and preferences of the institution. This 
    is not the case as climate change has the potential to manifest or drive risk within each of the  existing primary risk types.  As such, the final guidance should clearly state that climate risk does  not need to be treated as a stand-alone risk for reporting purposes.  Management of Risk Areas      The proposed principles further break out how banks should incorporate climate-related  financial risk across traditional risk types despite the previously acknowledged data limitations  limiting the ability of banks to effectively execute such an exercise.  Given the rapid development  of industry thinking and best practices on climate risk management and climate data collection  and analytic capabilities, any final guidance should provide sufficient flexibility for institutions to  develop, adopt, implement, and refine both (i) data capabilities and methodologies and (ii)  quantitative risk management tools that depend on that data, such as risk limits, risk appetites,  or scenario analysis.  These tools are instrumental to the application of the principles highlighted  in the management of risk areas section.     Other Comments on the Proposal  The FDIC Proposal states that “the manner in which financial institutions manage climate-related  financial risks to address safety and soundness concerns should also seek to reduce or mitigate  the impact that management of these risks may have on broader aspects of the economy.”  Truist  is concerned that this language may be read to imply a new, affirmative obligation for banks to  implement risk management activities in a way that mitigates the impact of its lending activities  “on broader aspects of the economy.”  Depending on the circumstances, such an obligation could  be at odds with a bank’s primary obligation to operate in a safe and sound manner, and present  boards of directors, management and regulators with contradictory mandates on a continuous  basis.  Truist encourages the FDIC to reconsider whether this kind of statement belongs in  prudential regulatory risk management guidance or is better left to elected policymakers.  Truist  also encourages the FDIC to coordinate with the other federal banking agencies regarding  concerns over broader economic impacts of climate-related financial risk management.   The FDIC’s proposal also requests comment on whether the federal banking agencies should  modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community  Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), to address the impact that climate-related financial risks may have on  low- and moderate income and other disadvantaged communities. Consistent with other  recommendations in this letter Truist encourages regulators modifying any existing regulations  to take measures to ensure they do not create a prescriptive regime that doesn’t reflect  variability across firms. Truist believes that there are multiple areas ripe for modification when  evaluating existing regulations and guidance to address climate-related financial risks on low- 
    and moderate income and other disadvantaged communities such as: i) clearly articulating which  types of activities, for both individual properties and large-scale community projects, would be  eligible for CRA credit; ii) ensuring transition externalities are addressed in a manner that  balances safety, soundness, and fairness through coordination and consultation with the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; and iii) coordination with the federal housing agencies  and government sponsored enterprises to improve other relevant federal programs, such as  flood insurance.

Sheesley   Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments—RIN 3064–ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429    RE: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management (RIN 3064–ZA32)    Dear Sir:    The Texas Bankers Association (TBA) is the oldest and largest state banking association  in the nation consisting of approximately 400 federally insured depository institutions  headquartered or conducting business in the State of Texas.  We take this opportunity to submit  comments and express process concerns in response to the Notice of Proposed Policy Statement  published in the Federal Register of April 4, 2022.1       By way of prefatory comment, on February 1, 2022, TBA’s Board of Directors adopted  the following resolution:  Resolved, that the TBA Board of Directors urges the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Board of Directors not to make any official policy decisions until  bipartisan representation is returned to the Board.     In several recent decisions, the Supreme Court has pointed out that multimember  administrative agencies, as opposed to single directorships, are accorded independent authority  due to several organizational features including, most notably, a board composition consisting of  members not being “from the same political party.”2  In doing so, the Court further observed that  “the Board was designed to be ‘non-partisan’ and ‘act with entire impartiality’ and to also  avoid  a ‘complete change’ in leadership ‘at any one time.’”3     1 87 Fed. Reg. 19508.   2 Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 140 S. Ct. 2183 (2020), citing Humphrey's  Executor v. United States,  55 S. Ct. 869 (1935); 295 U.S. 602 (1935).    3 Humphrey's Executor, Id. at 619-624. 
  At the time of the adoption of the Proposed Policy Statement, the membership of the  FDIC’s Board of Directors contained none of these essential conditions.     The Proposed Policy Statement would for the first time seek to establish, monitor, and  presumably enforce risk-management policies purportedly aimed at addressing “harm to people  and property arising from acute, climate-related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and  heatwaves, and chronic shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in  precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.”4   In addition to leading into yet another costly regulatory paradigm for banks, this is an  extraordinary leap into environmental policy that is well-removed from the FDIC’s self-stated  mission of examining and supervising financial institutions for “safety and soundness and  consumer protection.”5 The Proposed Policy Statement requests input on 14 separate issues but  fails to commence, as it must, with the specific statutory basis within the Federal Deposit Insurance  Act for exercising agency powers premised on global climate factors.   Here again, in overturning a COVID-related regulation, the Supreme Court has just  admonished that it expects Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise  powers of “vast ‘economic and political significance.’”6  Since its creation in 1933, no FDIC  regulation, policy statement, or other action has ever approached the size or scope of the proposal  under discussion herein.      The controlling statute lists the following areas as the prescribed standards for the “safety  and soundness” of insured depository institutions:  (A) internal controls, information systems, and  internal audit systems; (B) loan documentation; (C) credit underwriting; (D) interest rate exposure;  (E) asset growth; and (F) compensation, fees, and benefits.7  Nowhere on this list is there any  inference to broader climate issues beyond those already being addresses as directly related to the  performance of credit transactions such as collateral protection, flood insurance, etc.   It is well-established under principles under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) that  agencies are required to provide the “essential facts upon which the administrative decision was  based” and explain what justifies their determinations with actual evidence beyond a “conclusory  statement.”8  In terms of factual support, the Proposed Policy Statement cites only to the Financial  Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (2021) and the  Financial Stability Board report entitled the Implications of Climate Change for Financial Stability  (2020).         4 87 Fed. Reg. 19508.    5 https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers    6 Alabama Assn of Realtors et al. v. Dept. of Health & Human Services, No. 22A23s (Aug. 26, 2021).    7 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1.      8 Allied-Signal, Inc. v. Nuclear Reg. Comm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 152 (D.C. Cir. 1993).   
The 2021 FSOC report admits while “significant data related to climate change already  exists, there remain gaps in connecting the science of climate change to financial risk assessments  and real-world economic impacts.”9     In this regard, it is difficult to distinguish the Proposed Climate Policy Statement from  previous efforts to limit credit to politically disfavored industries.  Often referred to as “Operation  Choke Point,” those initiatives were appropriately withdrawn in the face of due process and other  legal concerns.       In Texas, we consider oil and gas to be an essential American industry which, last year  alone, contributed $411.6 billion to the state economy.     Estimates by Texas regulators further indicate the oil and gas industry comprises 35% of  the Texas economy and much of this activity involves small to medium-sized Texas banks and  scores of family-owned small businesses and service companies that underpin the energy sector.   The Proposed Policy Statement on Climate fails to encompass any small business impact analysis  section by which we specifically mean to include not just smaller banks but also the adverse impact  of this proposal on small business borrowers.      Moreover, energy destabilization resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, along with its  consequences, have demonstrated that domestic oil and gas production remain critical for  America’s economic and national security.     The Proposed Policy Statement specifies that it is directed at FDIC-regulated financial  institutions with more than $100 billion in total consolidated assets.  In practice, however, and as  amply demonstrated throughout the implementation of the Basel III bank capital rules, there is an  inevitable downhill flow to agency regulations and examination policies regardless of the  purported asset-size limitations.  Moreover, the documents accompanying the release of the  proposal itself indicate that the small bank exemption may only exist for an unspecified period of  time.      Lastly, we request your attention to the disparities which exist between the FDIC ’s climate  proposal and those published by other federal and state agencies.  In particular, we would point to  the FDIC requirement that insured banks “should also seek to reduce or mitigate the impact” of  climate risks on the economy in general.10  We are not aware of any other form of such an  unprecedented mandate such as this in the comparable proposals of the other federal banking  regulators and the Securities Exchange Commission.       As the principal federal regulator of state-chartered banks, the FDIC should also be aware  that the Proposed Policy Statement may also be in conflict with state law, such as Chapter 809,  Texas Government Code, which prohibits Texas state agencies from investing their public funds  in any company that penalizes or limits commercial relations with fossil fuel-based companies.   Texas is not the only state where this may be the case.  Therefore, the complicating effects of  incongruent state and federal policies on state-chartered institutions must be considered.        9 Id. at p. 23.    10 87 Fed. Reg. at 19509. 
The lack of FDIC independence, the assumption of authorities not granted, and the scope  of the proposed Policy Statement without complete assessment of its economic, regulatory, and  community impacts are significant proposal defects.  Thank you for taking these views into  consideration.        Most Gratefully,  Chris Furlow  President & Chief Executive Officer","The Texas Bankers Association (TBA) expresses concerns over the FDIC's Proposed Policy Statement on Climate-Related Financial Risk Management. TBA argues that the FDIC lacks bipartisan representation and questions the agency's authority to enforce climate-related policies, which they see as a departure from its mission of ensuring financial safety and soundness. The TBA highlights the absence of statutory basis for such policies and criticizes the lack of a small business impact analysis. They also point out potential conflicts with state laws, particularly in Texas, where the oil and gas industry is significant. The TBA warns of the proposal's potential economic impact, especially on small banks and businesses, and notes disparities with other federal and state agency proposals. They urge the FDIC to consider these issues before proceeding."

Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change—a crisis that puts our  financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk.  Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to  take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their  short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities.   I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:  Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business;  Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available;  Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits;  Make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments; and  Avoid risk management strategies that disproportionately harm disadvantaged communities. The FDIC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon  emissions. Banks’ management of climate-related risk should be factored into their supervisory  ratings, too.  It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate- related risk. The FDIC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks 
2 on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies  from banks where appropriate.    Thank you for your consideration of my comments. Please do NOT add my name to your mailing list.  I will learn about future developments on this issue from other sources.    Sincerely,  Christopher Lish  San Rafael, CA","The comment, submitted by Christopher Lish, addresses the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regarding the ""Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions."" Lish urges the FDIC to prevent financial institutions from exacerbating the climate crisis through continued investments in fossil fuels, which pose risks to the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. He supports the proposed guidance that recommends banks integrate climate risk management into all business levels, plan for long-term climate impacts, update models with new data, define climate risk exposures, and ensure internal strategies align with public climate commitments. Lish emphasizes the importance of avoiding risk management strategies that harm disadvantaged communities and suggests that banks' climate risk management should influence their supervisory ratings. He calls for the FDIC to issue strong guidance to minimize climate-related risks and protect against unsafe banking practices. Lish requests not to be added to the FDIC's mailing list."

Nevertheless, ICBA is concerned the FDIC  principles, if finalized, will have far-reaching consequences that will negatively impact the small  communities serviced by community banks.  ICBA is also concerned the FDIC principles will eventually be  applied to community banks, forcing an untenable and unnecessary regulatory burden upon the nation’s  smallest banks and their customers.3       1 The Independent Community Bankers of America® creates and promotes an environment where community  banks flourish. With nearly 50,000 locations nationwide, community banks constitute roughly 99 percent of all  banks, employ nearly 700,000 Americans and are the only physical banking presence in one in three U.S. counties.  Holding nearly $5.9 trillion in assets, over $4.9 trillion in deposits, and more than $3.5 trillion in loans to  consumers, small businesses and the agricultural community, community banks channel local deposits into the  Main Streets and neighborhoods they serve, spurring job creation, fostering innovation and fueling their  customers’ dreams in communities throughout America.     2 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Financial Institutions, RIN 3064-ZA32, 87 FR 19507, (April 4, 2022) available at: https://www.govinfo.gov  /content/pkg/FR-2022-04-04/pdf/2022-07065.pdf.    3 For example, in a statement accompanying the publication of the FDIC principles, Acting Chairman Gruenberg  expressly stated, “all financial institutions, regardless of size, complexity, or business model, are subject to climate- related financial risks.”  FDIC, Statement by Martin J.

Page 2 of 10    Additionally, ICBA is troubled the agency published the FDIC principles without first conducting any  independent studies or gathering empirical data from FDIC supervised institutions to examine the extent  to which banks may or may not be managing climate related financial risks, and in turn, the degree in  which climate risks may, or may not, pose an immediate threat to bank safety and soundness or the  stability of the financial system.4  The FDIC principles are nearly identical to the OCC’s draft principles for  climate-related financial risk management for large banks (“the OCC principles”), which the OCC  published only six months ago.  Notably, the OCC principles were also published without that agency  performing any studies or gathering empirical data to demonstrate climate-risks are a threat to bank  safety and soundness.5      The absence of empirical data to support the publication of either the FDIC principles or the OCC  principles coupled with the FDIC’s repurposing of the OCC principles suggests the true aim of this  proposal may be to effectuate “Operation Chokepoint” by choking off legal but climate disfavored  businesses and industries from the financial system.  Operation Chokepoint was a misguided agency  initiative that should never be resurrected, no matter how laudable the end-goal may be.    In light of these concerns, ICBA appreciates this opportunity to reiterate the comments we offered in  response to the OCC’s proposed framework, offer our recommendations for how the FDIC principles or  future guidance can be improved, and share our reasoning why the FDIC should not apply this proposed  climate risk management framework to community banks.    I.  The FDIC Has Not Published Empirical Data to Support Its Conclusion that Climate-related  Financial Risk Is a Threat to Bank Safety and Soundness.     On May 20, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Treasury, as  the Chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), to “engage with FSOC members” to assess  climate-related financial risk.6   In response to the Executive Order, the FSOC subsequently published a  report on climate related financial risks, which directed FSOC members to “address climate-related  financial risks consistent with their mandates, focusing on the safety and soundness of regulated  institutions.”7  Only two months later, on December 16, 2021, the OCC published the OCC principles  which set forth the sweeping conclusion that “weaknesses in how banks identify, measure, monitor, and    4 See FDIC, Statement by Martin J. Gruenberg, Acting Chairman, FDIC Board of Directors on the Request for  Comment on the Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (March 30, 2022) available at: https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/2022/spmar3022.html, wherein  the Acting Chairman stated, “The effects of climate change and the transition to reduced reliance on carbon- emitting sources of energy present emerging economic and financial risks to the safety and soundness of financial  institutions and the stability of the financial system.”      5 See generally Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management  for Large Banks (Dec. 16, 2021) available at: https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr- occ-2021-138a.pdf.      6 Exec. Order No. 14,030, 87 Fed. Reg. 27967 (May 20, 2021).    7 Financial Stability Oversight Council Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (Oct. 21, 2021) available at:  https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf.   
Page 3 of 10    control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate could adversely  affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall financial system.”8       While both the President and the FSOC asked the federal financial regulators to explore climate-related  financial risks consistent with their mandates, neither concluded climate-related financials risk  constitutes a safety and soundness risk to individual banks.  Yet, the OCC principles and the FDIC  principles cite the FSOC Report as the definitive support for the agencies’ conclusions that climate- related financial risks may threaten bank safety and soundness.      The echo chamber between the FSOC, the OCC, and now the FDIC is reverberating.  ICBA questions why  the FDIC has not offered its own additional, independent, or separate evidentiary, statistical,  meteorological, or empirical support for its position, or cited even a single instance of bank failure  related to an extreme weather event or due to a bank’s failure to manage climate-related financial risk.   Additionally troublesome is that the FDIC has not acknowledged that other federal financial regulators  have concluded “the average FEMA disaster is not detrimental to bank stability.”9     Without more data to support its conclusions, any final rules or guidance the FDIC issues on climate- related financial risk could be deemed arbitrary and capricious.  To mitigate these concerns, we  encourage the FDIC to gather empirical data, conduct studies, and coordinate with the members of  FSOC, as well as other government stakeholders including the SBA, FEMA, and USDA, prior to engaging  in further rulemaking or issuing additional guidance related to climate-related financial risk.      II.  The FDIC Should Explain Its Approach to Climate-related Financial Risk Is Not Intended to  Facilitate “Operation Chokepoint.”    ICBA is concerned the FDIC principles, however well-intentioned the framework may be, will politicize  the agency, jeopardize the independence of the agency, and discourage banks from doing business with  legal but climate disfavored industries such as carbon-intensive industries.  Because the FDIC principles  broadly apply to every facet of risk management, and do not provide guidance to banks or examiners to  differentiate material climate-related risk exposures from all conceivable climate-related risk exposures,  there is a troubling possibility the FDIC could cite deficiencies in climate-related risk management at  every bank in every examination.  As such, ICBA is concerned the FDIC could use the FDIC principles to  implement “Operation Chokepoint” and pressure banks to terminate business relationships with clients  engaged in lawful activity by “de-risking” their portfolios and declining basic banking services, such as  deposit accounts and loans, to entire categories of industries the FDIC believes may present climate- related financial risk.      The FDIC broadly defines “transition risks” as “stresses to certain banks or sectors arising from the shifts  in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the changes necessary to    8 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large  Banks (Dec. 16, 2021) available at: https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021- 138a.pdf.      9 Staff Reports, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, How Bad are Weather Disasters for Banks?, No. 990 (Nov. 2021)  at page 9 (emphasis added) available at: https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr990.    
Page 4 of 10    limit climate change.”10  Although the FDIC does not further define transition risks, provide examples of  transition risks, or specify which industries or occurrences might pose the most material transition risks,  the FDIC principles require large financial institutions to analyze transition risk considerations within  every aspect of risk management, including governance, policies, procedures and limits, strategic  planning, risk management, data risk measurement and reporting, and scenario analysis.  The FDIC  principles also require large financial institutions to analyze transition risks within every facet of risk  assessments including credit risk, liquidity risk, other financial risk, operational risk, legal and compliance  risk, and other nonfinancial risk.    Both the breadth and lack of specificity in this proposal leave open the possibility that any number of  lawful industries could be choked off from the financial system for posing climate risk, including  industries that are carbon-intensive, or consume large amounts of water, energy and other natural  resources, or produce, supply, or consume fertilizer and chemicals, or generate waste, and the list goes  on.      It is plausible an examiner could broadly interpret the FDIC principles in such a way that any banking  activity that poses a physical or transition climate risk must be eliminated entirely. Banks should not be  forced by their regulator to de-risk entire categories of business customers based on speculation that   transition risks, no matter how remote, could negatively impact the customer. Further, while  community banks typically are not the primary source of financing for large energy producing  companies, they do provide the majority of small business credit in those communities where energy  production, refinement, transportation and other ancillary businesses exist.  Policies that would reduce  access to credit to those businesses because they are connected to the fossil fuel industry would have  devastating impacts on the local economies served by community banks.            The Department of Justice has concluded that Operation Chokepoint was a “misguided initiative” and  that “law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular  administration might disfavor.”11  If the FDIC has no intention of forcing banks to de-risk their portfolios  or choke off lawful but climate disfavored industries from the financial system, the agency should make  this abundantly clear in any finalized guidance and/or rules and state there will not be a supervisory  expectation that banks de-risk entire geographies or industries from their lending portfolios.    III.  Current Risk Management Practices Adequately Protect Community Banks from Climate- related Financial Risks.      As stewards of their local communities, community bankers have every incentive to ensure their lending  practices support the long-term prosperity of their local economies.  A community bank cannot flourish  without the success of the local community because its customers and loan portfolios are geographically  concentrated within the local markets the community bank serves.  The risks of economic shocks,    10 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Financial Institutions, RIN 3064-ZA32, 87 FR 19507, (April 4, 2022).     11 Letter from Stephen E.

Page 5 of 10    customer displacement and damaged collateral (risks the FDIC characterizes in the context of climate  change as “transition risks” and “physical risks”) are not novel risks for community banks to manage,  and each of these risks, if not properly managed, undoubtedly has the potential to impact a community  bank.  But history has shown that because community banks are experts in managing their risk,  community banks do not fail simply because climate-related financial risks exist.  This fact is evidenced  by the FDIC’s failure to publish any empirical data to explain the Acting Chairman’s conclusion that  “climate-related financial risks pose a clear and significant risk to the U.S. financial system, and if  improperly assessed and managed, may pose a threat to safe and sound banking and financial  stability.”12  Importantly, although FDIC data shows 4,104 U.S. banks have failed since 1934, the FDIC  principles do not describe a single instance of bank failure due to a bank’s improper management of  “physical risks” and “transition risks” related to climate change.13      While the FDIC believes “financial institutions are likely to be affected by both the physical risks and  transition risks associated with climate change,” these “affects” are not necessarily negative, and do not  ipso facto constitute threats to bank safety and soundness.   In fact, in a recent New York Federal  Reserve staff report titled, ”How Bad are Weather Disasters for Banks?” (“the Staff Report”), the  financial regulator evaluated all FEMA disasters and found “generally insignificant or small effects on  bank performance and stability.  In particular, loan losses and default risk at local banks [did] not  increase significantly . . . [m]oreover, not all effects are bad; income of multi-county banks increase  significantly with disaster exposure.”   According to the Staff Report, “local banks” (i.e. community  banks) have “superior geographic knowledge” that “helps them avoid areas where disaster risks are  more frequent than expected based on common knowledge.”14  Community banks have superior  geographic knowledge as compared to their large-bank counterparts because “banks located closer to  their borrowers have been found to harbor knowledge of both borrowers and local risk that more  distant lenders may lack.”15  For example, “local banks reallocated mortgage lending from census tracts  where flood risks seem understated relative to the FEMA maps (given recent flooding experience).”16  By  contrast, the Staff Report’s authors did not observe similar behavior at multi-county banks.17      12 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Statement by Martin J.

Page 6 of 10    The detailed findings from the New York Federal Reserve are strong evidence community banks do not  need additional regulation to manage climate-related financial risks.  Since the late 19th century,  community banks have successfully implemented risk management practices, and in so doing, have  weathered and survived every type of natural disaster, including catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes,  earthquakes, wind events, droughts, freezes, snowstorms, wildfires, landslides, volcanoes, and flooding.   As detailed below, community banks’ current, validated, and long-standing risk management practices  are not only adequate for community banks to evaluate climate-related financial risks, but they are also  effective in ensuring community banks are operationally resilient and protected from failure in the  aftermath of economic shocks and natural disasters.     a. Disaster Preparedness and Response  Community banks are well-equipped to prepare for and respond to natural disasters and property  losses.  Community banks maintain detailed business continuity plans which outline the processes the  bank will follow before, during, and after a natural disaster to safeguard employees, customers,  products and services, and remain operational with limited business disruption.18  These disaster plans  are not obscure documents buried in dusty file drawers but are instead meticulously prepared, diligently  tested, and carefully guarded reference guides that bank employees are ready to follow at any  moment’s notice.  Business continuity plans not only contemplate the physical destruction of bank  collateral, including the bank headquarters, ATMS, and branches, but also detail how the bank will  respond to the needs of its customers and the community-at-large, and, in particular cash needs, in the  aftermath of a disaster’s destruction.  As part of these plans, community banks proactively ensure they  have enough cash on hand to meet customer needs and that redundant systems are in place so  customers can continue to use debit cards and banks can readily access digitally stored bank records.   Community banks also contemplate how bank employees can continue to utilize operationally critical  systems and communicate with bank personnel, emergency responders, regulators, customers, and  vendors in the event there is a loss of power, loss of physical bank records, inaccessible roadways, and  displaced bank employees and customers.      b. Concentration Risk Management  Community banks are also adept in managing other types of risks, such as concentration risk, under the  FDIC’s existing risk management framework.  Every community bank portfolio is concentrated  geographically, thus all community banks are exposed to some degree of credit concentration risk.  Yet,  exposure to concentration risk, even significant concentration risk, is not indicative that a bank will fail  or that the bank should be subject to heightened supervisory scrutiny.  Instead, the relevant inquiry is  whether the concentration risk is material and whether the bank has properly managed its risk  exposures.  To measure the materiality of concentration risk, community banks and their regulators  evaluate the quantity of risk exposures, the quality of a bank’s risk management framework, the  strength of bank governance, the adequacy of internal controls, and perform stress tests.  As  demonstrated during thousands of examinations, community banks are adept in mitigating risk due to  seasonal weather changes and natural disasters, and credit concentration and should not be subject to  additional burdensome, costly, duplicative, and unnecessary climate-related risk management practices.    18 See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FIL-62-2017, Interagency Supervisory Examiner Guidance for  Institutions Affected by a Major Disaster (Dec. 15, 2017).  See also FFIEC, Business Continuity Management Booklet  available at: https://ithandbook.ffiec.gov/it-booklets/business-continuity-management.aspx.     
Page 7 of 10      c. Underwriting Practices and Estimating Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (“ALLL”)  Existing due diligence and underwriting practices enable community bankers to carefully assess the level  of risk posed by every customer relationship and ensure effective controls are in place to monitor these  relationships on an ongoing basis.  If necessary, community banks will shorten the maturity of their  loans to protect the bank not only from interest rate risk but also from many different types of  underwriting risks including climate risks.      Additionally, under the current supervisory framework for estimating credit losses, banks are expressly  required to consider “qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses  associated with the institution’s existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience.”19 The FDIC  and other prudential regulators expect allowance estimates for ALLL to be “based on a comprehensive,  well-documented, and consistently applied analysis of the loan portfolio, and should take into  consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including  environmental factors such as industry, geographical, economic, and political factors.”20     Plainly stated, the qualitative and environmental factors community banks currently use to analyze the  adequacy of ALLL already estimate and quantify climate-related financial risk.  For example, if a bank is  located in a market that is in severe drought, the bank will increase qualitative and environmental  factors to account for this increased risk to the loan portfolio, which in turn results in an increase in the  bank’s allowance estimate.  Since community banks already consider qualitative and environmental  factors as part of their “comprehensive, well-documented, and consistently applied ALLL analysis,” and  since most community banks will be subject to CECL by 2023 and be required to be forward looking with  their estimates of loan losses, a separate risk management framework for climate risk is unnecessary.    d. Securing Insurance Policies to Offset Risk  With respect to their lending and investment activities, community banks are keenly aware of the  importance of risk mitigation particularly during times of economic stress or extreme weather  events.  To mitigate climate, disaster, and concentration risks, community banks ensure their property  loans have adequate flood insurance and their agricultural loans have adequate crop insurance.  Crop  insurance allows agricultural producers to recover from severe weather disasters and repay their farm  loans.     Additionally, community banks diversify their agricultural loan portfolios by utilizing the safety nets,  insurance, and market protections for farmers and agricultural lenders authorized by the farm bill,  including the Farm Service Agency’s Guaranteed Farm Loan Programs.  The farm bill, adopted by  Congress approximately every five years, provides an income safety net for commodity prices to bolster  income for farmers and ranchers. The farm bill also offers farmers and ranchers several guaranteed farm  loan programs. The guaranteed farm loan programs protect up to 90 – 95 percent of the loan principal,    19 Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of Thrift Supervision, Interagency Policy  Statement on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, available at:  https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws  /rules/5000-4700.html.    20 Id.  
Page 8 of 10    thus ensuring the repayment of most of the loan principal should farmers and ranchers become unable  to repay their loans. These programs also help protect community banks against loan losses by providing  tools to manage their concentration risks, which is particularly important to banks that specialize in  agricultural lending.    IV.  Mandatory Scenario Analysis Is Not Appropriate for Community Banks.     Scenario analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise that should not be mandatory for  community banks.  To perform mandatory scenario analysis, community banks would likely need to hire  specialized third-party consultants and experts to perform the work.  Our members report that even  conservative estimates for an independent audit can exceed $100,000.  Because there are few  individuals and firms qualified to perform climate change scenario analysis, the demand for this service,  if mandatory for community banks, would only push the costs of these audits and exercises even higher.   Community banks cannot afford to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to third parties to perform  climate change scenario analyses, particularly if these analyses are evaluating immaterial or remote  climate-related financial risks or are unlikely to result in any measurable changes to business operations.    Since most community banks will be subject to CECL beginning in 2023, many of them will find it  necessary to stress test their loan portfolios to make accurate estimates of future losses under the new  accounting standard.  Further, community banks can test and validate their business continuity plans by  participating in FEMA’s National Exercise Program and the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation  Program.  Given that community bank portfolios are generally not as complex as large bank portfolios,  and because community banks already perform numerous stress testing exercises, community banks  simply do not need to perform yet another duplicative scenario analysis.      ICBA is also concerned mandatory scenario analysis could force community banks to engage in an  impossibly difficult exercise of forecasting for remote risks that may occur decades in the future, or  which may never transpire.  The longer the timeframes that are selected in scenario analysis for default  and loss projections, the more speculative and expensive the analysis becomes, while the utility of the  exercise, and the likelihood of any measurable changes to the business, are greatly reduced.    V.  Any Approach to Climate-related Financial Risk Management Must be Guided by Materiality    One of the biggest challenges community banks would face in incorporating the FDIC principles into  their risk management systems is anticipating, measuring, forecasting, and analyzing unknown and  unquantifiable risks.  As proposed, the FDIC principles are incredibly broad and lack specificity to help  banks and examiners identify material climate-related financial risks that could warrant heightened  scrutiny.  The FDIC principles do not contain any guardrails to ensure examiners cannot get carried away  in criticizing financially healthy banks on the basis of remote, or highly speculative, or immaterial  climate-related risks.       The FDIC principles also do not contain defining terms, detailed hypothetical or explanatory examples,  time periods for forecasting, or even specify a common data set banks should use to analyze climate  related financial risks.  ICBA is concerned that without any of these limits, the FDIC principles can  broadly apply to every type of physical risk or transition risk imaginable, no matter how immaterial or  remote, and banks could therefore be subject to undue regulatory scrutiny for minor deficiencies in 
Page 9 of 10    their risk management programs that are only tenuously related to climate-risk.  The resources and  costs that would be necessary to comply with the FDIC principles could quickly overwhelm a community  bank’s limited staff or force a community bank to de-risk entire industries or loan portfolios even if the  bank had no other safety and soundness weaknesses.    VI.  ICBA Recommendations     To the greatest extent possible, the FDIC should coordinate with other agencies and develop a  harmonized approach to climate change with the members of the FSOC, as well as the SBA,  FEMA, and USDA.  These agencies should adopt a flexible approach that acknowledges evolving  bank and supervisory practices as well as varying degrees of material climate-related financial  risks.     The FDIC should conduct outreach meetings with community banks to better understand why  climate risk principles that may be appropriate for large institutions are not appropriate for  community banks.     The FDIC should not apply the FDIC principles or any climate-related financial risk framework to  community banks with fewer than $100 billion in assets.     Before finalizing the FDIC principles or any additional guidance, the FDIC should conduct studies  jointly with the members of FSOC, as well as the SBA, FEMA, and USDA to understand whether  empirical data supports the conclusion that climate risks are a significant threat to the safety  and soundness of the financial system, and to determine whether a separate climate-related  financial risk management framework is necessary.     The FDIC should host voluntary climate risk exercises, similar to tech sprints, to facilitate an  open dialogue among government stakeholders, banks, insurers, vendors, and other third  parties and to identify whether a separate climate-related financial risk management framework  is necessary.     If the FDIC’s climate-related financial risk management framework is not intended to “choke- off” specific industries from the financial system, any future guidance should expressly inform  examiners there is no supervisory expectation that banks de-risk legal but climate disfavored  industries.     ICBA is supportive of some incentive-based solutions to address climate change.  For example,  the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) recently issued an industry letter  which describes the circumstances in which banking institutions subject to the New York  Community Reinvestment Act (“NY CRA”) may receive credit in connection with financing  projects addressing climate change, including credit for financing activities that reduce or  prevent the emission of greenhouse gases that cause climate change, and adapt to life in a  changing climate.  The NYDFS has stated banks may qualify for credit under the NY CRA for  community development lending or qualified investments that stabilize community  development such as investments in renewable energy and water conservation equipment to  reduce utility payments for low to moderate income (“LMI”) tenants, community solar projects,  microgrid or battery storage projects in LMI areas with high flood and/or wind risk, projects

Martin J. Gruenberg  Acting Chair, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th St. NW   Washington, DC 20429  Thank you, Chairman Gruenberg, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks.  Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change–a crisis that puts our financial system, people of  color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk.   Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps  necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from  endangering our economy and communities.  I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they:  1. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; 3. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 4. Make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments; and 5. Avoid risk management strategies that disproportionately harm disadvantaged communities. The FDIC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’  management of climate-related risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too.  It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate-related risk. The FDIC  must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against  unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.  Sincerely,  East Peterson‐Trujillo  they/them/theirs  Climate Financial Policy Campaigner, Public Citizen  (925)705‐5814 | ept@citizen.org | @east_p_t
Martin J. Gruenberg Acting Chair, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 550 17th St. NW Washington, DC 20429 Thank you, Chairman Gruenberg, for taking up the issue of climate change and banks. Banks' continued investments in fossil fuels are driving climate change–a crisis that puts our financial system, people of color and low-income communities, and our planet at risk. Regulators must not let financial institutions gamble with our future. We need you to push banks to take the urgent steps necessary to address the dangers they face from climate change, and stop their short-term business decisions from endangering our economy and communities. I support the proposed guidance’s recommendations to banks that they: 1. Incorporate climate-related risk management into every level of business; 2. Plan for climate change over a long time horizon, and update models as additional data becomes available; 3. Develop clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures, and metrics for setting limits; 4. Make sure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public-facing climate commitments; and 5. Avoid risk management strategies that disproportionately harm disadvantaged communities. The FDIC must ensure that banks’ actions match their commitments to zeroing out their net carbon emissions. Banks’ management of climate-related risk should be factored into their supervisory ratings, too. It is in the best interest of both the public and banks themselves to act now to minimize climate-related risk. The FDIC must use the full extent of its authority to issue strong final guidance to banks on climate risk, continue to protect against unsafe and unsound bank practices, and require remedies from banks where appropriate.

It criticizes banks for their continued investments in fossil fuels, which contribute to climate change and pose risks to the financial system, marginalized communities, and the planet. The comment supports the FDIC's proposed guidance urging banks to integrate climate-related risk management into their operations, plan for long-term climate impacts, define risk exposures, align internal strategies with public climate commitments, and avoid strategies that harm disadvantaged communities. It emphasizes the need for banks to match their actions with their commitments to reduce carbon emissions and suggests that climate risk management should influence banks' supervisory ratings. The comment calls for the FDIC to use its authority to enforce strong guidance and ensure banks take necessary actions to mitigate climate-related risks."

Given the intensifying pace of climate change, it is important to have a continuous  dialogue with banking regulators to develop and determine the best approach to the  treatment of climate-related financial risks.      We welcome the agencies’ principles-based approach to addressing risk management  practices related to climate risk. We support public sector efforts to establish regulatory    1 Please see Appendix for information regarding each Association.   2 87 Fed.

                                                                                       2    principles and guidance surrounding new and emerging climate-related financial risks  that align with the existing risk management regulatory framework. We believe that  climate-related financial risks are drivers of existing risks. Accordingly, banks are at a  developmental stage in embedding these risks into their existing risk management  frameworks.     As an initial matter, we are concerned with a statement in the FDIC’s preamble to the  proposed principles that was not included in the OCC’s proposal.  Specifically, the  FDIC’s preamble states that “the manner in which financial institutions manage climate- related financial risks to address safety and soundness concerns should also seek to  reduce or mitigate the impact that management of these risks may have on broader  aspects of the economy.”  We are concerned that this vague statement suggests that  financial institutions are subject to an obligation to manage risks in order to lessen the  impact of activities “on broader aspects of the economy.”  This would not only be an  unprecedented requirement for financial institutions to have to comply with, but it also  could have the unintended impact of forcing banks to develop risk management practices  related to the “broader economy” that are impossible to measure in practice.  We  therefore request that the FDIC delete this reference in the final iteration of these climate- risk guidelines.    Currently, our member banks’ risk management practices, in the context of climate- related financial risk, have centered around the identification and evaluation of potential  climate-related financial risks under different scenarios, specifically focusing on  assessing potential materiality for different risks over different time horizons.5 These  efforts have helped identify some inadequacies and challenges, including data limitations  and complexities arising from a variety of different scenarios and time horizons.  However, given the various challenges our members face when conducting scenario  analysis, as explained in more detail below, we believe it is currently premature to  incorporate climate-related financial risks into capital and liquidity adequacy assessment.      Our comments below focus on four (4) key areas that are particularly important to our  members as they are an integral part of an effective risk-management framework. These    include:    • Data: The availability of relevant, accurate and timely data is the key  impediment in quantifying climate-related financial risks into banks’ exposures.    • Scenario analysis: Institutions should have flexibility to create their own model  designs with the data available based on principles-based regulatory guidance.   • Responsibility of the board: An effective risk-management framework should  clearly distinguish and define the role and responsibility of the board relative to  senior management.     5 To-date, banks have employed various time horizons in determining climate-related risk. 
                                                                                       3    • Regulatory coordination: As climate-related financial risks are global in  nature, regulators should use their best efforts to coordinate on a regional and  international basis when establishing principles or guidance that address climate  risk.     Data    The key challenge that banks face in incorporating climate-related financial risk into their  respective risk management frameworks is the fact that existing data and tools to measure  and quantify climate-related financial risk—and in particular, longer-term transition and  physical risks—are only just emerging. Such data will need to undergo substantial  exploration, refinement, and adaptation over time. Although data capabilities are  improving, significant gaps in data sourcing, capture, standardization, and aggregation  substantially affect the accuracy of projections and risk assessment. For example, there is  a growing disparity between the increasing availability of transition risk data as compared  to less available physical risk data. Consequently, banks’ ability to understand and  analyze physical risks is still evolving.     In this regard, we agree with the agencies’ view reflected in the Principles that sound risk  management is significantly dependent on the availability of relevant, accurate, and  timely data. We also appreciate that the Principles acknowledge that the development of  bank risk management frameworks to embed climate-related financial risks is iterative  and will continue to evolve alongside wider developments, such as the availability of  better quality, and more specific data.     Accordingly, any additional guidance published subsequent to these Principles should  take a flexible approach, encouraging banks to individually consider, with the data  presently available, how climate-related financial risks impact their particular business  and respective risk management frameworks.     Scenario Analysis     We agree with the agencies that climate-related scenario analysis is an important tool that  can be used to explore the potential impacts of climate-related financial risks on banks’  portfolios and the overall business model. We recognize that such an exercise could  enhance efforts to understand potential impacts, limitations, and improve our  understanding of what needs to or can be done in the context of climate-related financial  risk.     We are supportive of the agencies’ view that firms should develop and implement  climate-related scenario analysis frameworks in a manner commensurate to the bank’s  size, complexity, business activity, and risk profile. To-date, our members are actively 
                                                                                       4    engaged in developing their scenario analysis capabilities and running exercises across  different parts of their portfolios.     Given liquidity and shorter term nature of trading book positions, banks may not deem this risk as  material and should have flexibility around how to incorporate climate into market risk  measurement.  We support further development of climate scenarios to reach a consensus  on available scientific and economic forecasts and a range of scenarios, such that  individual banks can then tailor their approach to reflect their bank specific business  models and risk profiles. For example, the Network for Greening the Financial System,  Representative Concentration Pathways, and International Energy Agency’s scenarios  can be used to meet regulatory and risk management needs.    Also, publicly available climate scenarios do not provide banks with the appropriate  sectoral and regional granularity to directly translate scenario output into readily  consumable inputs for internal risk modeling. For banks, the value of climate scenario  analysis can only be fully realized when the science-based or macroeconomic output is  expanded into more granular financial impacts that can be applied across a diverse set of  client industries and sub-sectors. Additionally, there is still a limited understanding of the  climate economic models that drive these scenarios, which makes it more challenging for  banks and vendors alike to expand scenario output while staying within the bounds of the  model.    Given these challenges, scenario analysis should be considered an exploratory exercise,  at this point in time, that enables firms to identify key areas of the business model that  could be impacted by climate risk (both transition and physical) events. Conducting such  exercises should also inform the firm’s modelling strategies as the industry gradually  develops more sophisticated capabilities. Indeed, many of our members are participating  in industry-wide initiatives developing scenario analysis frameworks and methodologies  to assess climate-related impact. In this regard, any guidance from the agencies should be  principle-based and should allow institutions to have flexibility to create their own model  designs with the information at-hand.       Responsibility of the Board     We are concerned that, as drafted, the Principles sometimes inappropriately equate the  role of the board to that of the senior management, and thus, improperly assign  responsibilities to both the board and senior management interchangeably. For example,  the Principles recommend that the board “incorporate climate-related risks into [banks’]  internal control frameworks” and “monitor how climate-related financial risks affect the  bank’s exposure to risk related to changing prices.” These types of responsibilities run  counter to the board’s role as an oversight body that oversees and challenges the  executive management team, holding the executive to account. In this regard, we  recommend that references to “monitoring” should include only management and not the 
                                                                                       5    board. Such responsibilities are better suited for the senior management and key staff that  have access to the day-to-day information and can create and amend policies within the  bank based on the available information. Blurring the lines between boards and  executives could defy the purpose of strong internal governance.    In addition, the Principles place a significant amount of responsibility on the board with  respect to strategic direction as it relates to climate-related financial risk and fail to  recognize banks’ various internal management structures. For example, the board is  expected to determine the bank’s “risk appetite” in the context of climate-related  financial risk, whilst this is typically the responsibility of senior management. In general,  banks may assign these responsibilities in different ways. In certain cases, the board may  play a more hands-on role; while in other cases, the senior management designs and  crafts the banks’ strategic direction, with the board endorsing the plan and providing  general oversight.       We provide a few other examples where we think this distinction could be better  clarified:    • Governance section   o A materiality concept should be included in this section, as it is elsewhere  (e.g., “actively oversee the bank’s material risk taking activities”).  o The general statement “sound governance includes . . .” would benefit  from some delineation between board and management responsibilities.   • Strategic planning section – “Boards” should not be included in references to  public statements as this is beyond the scope of what the board would actually be  tasked with, in particular “any” public statement.  • Credit risk section – Suggest amending the last sentence to “Management should  determine changes to credit risk appetite or relevant risk management metrics as a  result of climate risk, which would be approved by the board these risks.” The  Principles should also clarify that management “determines” and the board  approves credit risk appetite.  Accordingly, the Principles would benefit from: (1) more flexibility in acknowledging  various bank structures, (2) clear differentiation between the roles of the board and senior  management, and (3) recognition that, in general, a board’s responsibilities with respect  to the governance are distinct from the responsibilities of the bank’s senior management.     Regulatory Coordination     Given a fast-evolving landscape, the effective global coordination of prudential and  supervisory principles is critical. Our members are keen on global financial regulators 
                                                                                       6    developing common principles of how to address climate-related financial risks across  the financial system.    Global regulatory coordination will support banks in embedding climate-related financial  risks into their risk management frameworks, including across operating entities in  different jurisdictions. Any finalized Principles should address the need for harmonized  supervisory principles, domestically and internationally.    In this regard, we would welcome additional, coordinated guidance from the regulatory  community in the following areas:     • Consensus around scientific and economic forecasts and further international  coordination and collaboration on the development of climate-risk models.   • Solutions to overcome a lack of relevant granular data and development of robust  climate-related financial risk model frameworks; and  • Collaboration between prudential and market regulators to mitigate any  unintended negative impacts on capital markets, including transition finance  market.

We commend the  agencies for their consideration of these important issues. We look forward to the  issuance of further guidance relating to climate-related financial risks.    Our members are strongly committed to maintaining the safety and efficiency of the U.S.  financial markets and recognize that banks have a big role to play in the management of  climate-related financial risks. We hope that the FDIC will consider our suggestions, as  they reflect the extensive knowledge and experience of financial market professionals  within our memberships.

They support the FDIC's and OCC's goals to enhance risk management but express concerns over a vague statement in the FDIC's preamble suggesting banks manage risks to lessen broader economic impacts. They argue this could impose unprecedented and impractical requirements. The Associations highlight challenges in data availability, scenario analysis, and the roles of boards versus management. They call for flexibility in regulatory guidance, emphasizing the need for global coordination and improved data and scenario analysis frameworks. They also stress the importance of clear distinctions between board and management responsibilities in risk governance. The Associations appreciate the opportunity to comment and look forward to further guidance."

Applicability  Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model, should  inform financial institutions' adoption of these principles?  MESG believes the principles can be applicable to institutions of any size and location. An argument  could be made that smaller financial institutions are even more vulnerable to climate risk due to  (typically) localized/concentrated composition of their portfolios. Thus, such financial institutions  shall benefit from a robust climate-related financial risk management framework, e.g., in the form of  capital relief from geographical diversification across less climate-hazard prone areas, or from  diversification across sectors with different exposure to transition risk. 
       B. Tailoring Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations? While the principles capture the necessary requirements at a high level,it could be helpful to further outline how financial institutionscould reflect climate-related risks in capital adequacy assessments. There could be additional guidance on specific forward-looking metricsthatinstitutionsshoulduse to assess and in turn,disclose their physical and transition risks. For example,somemetrics have been suggested in the appendix of the TCFD report Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, released in October 2021.C.

Current Risk Management Practices Question 5: What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks?Financial institutions are starting to integrate climate data into their risk management processes. For example, a large North American bank leveraged MA’sclimate macroeconomic scenarios and climate-adjusted probability of default data to assess exposure in the bank’s portfolio under multiple scenarios. Likewise, insurance firms use RMS’(a Moody’s Analytics Company)baseline models and climate conditioned catastrophe models to examine physical risk exposure in their portfolios. For more information on these and other examples see the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative released The Climate Risk Tool Landscape, 2022 Supplement.Question 6: How do financial institutions determine when climate related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?

Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and  assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks? 
       Webelieve that a range of short to long term time horizons are relevant depending on afinancialinstitution’s risk management objectives. For shorter-horizon analyses, MA’sresearch3shows how historical data can be used to estimate the probabilities of events such as cyclones, and the impact from such events. In addition to the use in business, shorter-horizon analyses can be used as steppingstones by banks to develop their methodological and data capabilities before embarking on more challenging yet important long-horizon analyses. Datasets are currently available with a variety of time horizons, such as climate-adjusted probability of default models with a 30 year time horizon.4Likewise, for longer-term analysis existing datasets integrate climate risk into economic risk modeling out to 2100.5Question 8: What, if any, specific products,practices, and strategies—for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments—do financial institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks? Question 9: What, if any, climaterelated financial products or services—for example, ‘‘green bonds,’’ derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account—do financial institutions offer to clients and customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose? Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Should the agencies modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act, to address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Although this question is directed at financial institutions, MA and MESGoffer the following perspectives based on our experience on these topics. Academic research demonstrates that equity concerns related to climate risk exposure of vulnerable communities are indeed a major concern. For example,as per the MESG blogpost ‘Racial Justice and Climate Change: Exposure’quoting research by Jesse Keenan and others on ‘blue-lining’ brings to light the risk of reinforcing historical and current discriminations and worsening social and racial injustice. More background on climate risk and disadvantaged communities is available here.There are opportunities to test alternative risk mitigation options such as varying insurance coverage, exploring asset-level resilience measures (such as waterproofing lower floors, upgrading to fire resistant    3 Ozkanoglu et al.

More background on climate risk and  disadvantaged communities is available here.  There are opportunities to test alternative risk mitigation options such as varying insurance coverage,  exploring asset-level resilience measures (such as waterproofing lower floors, upgrading to fire resistant 
       material, etc.), engaging with borrowers and communities on their risk exposure and risk management, or adjusting holdings within a portfolio to balance risk. For example, lenders can engage with mortgage applicants around their asset’s climate risk exposure so that they understand the risks they are taking and the true costs associated with the asset. Lenders can encourage home buyers to invest in resilience measures that will increase the viability of the mortgage while decreasing their own financial risk exposure. Likewise, lenders may be able to work with loan insurance or mortgage insurance to reduce premiums, e.g., if a homebuyer paid a higher price for a more resilient home (or if the homebuyer implements their own resilience measures that meet certain resilience standards). Engaging with local governments to ensure they are positioned to invest in adaptation and protect vulnerable communities could also mitigate potential negative impact on lower income households. Additional discussion on adaptation and racial justice is available here.E. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models from borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial institutions currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools or models? We believe it is crucial for financial institutions to collect data on the geographical footprint of their counterparties due to the localized nature of physical climate change risk. For corporate loans, this includes the locations of firms' facilities, as well as their suppliers. This data is essential to properly quantify counterparties' exposures to physical risk and understand their portfolio-level implications. Business interruption due to climate related issues with suppliers needs to be addressed and quantified by banks and financial institutions, in addition to risks associated with operations of the counterparties themselves.With respect to managing transition risk in their portfolio, we believe it is also important for the institutions to collect data on GHG emissions footprint, emissions reductions plans, business models, physical risk management plansand other relevant metrics which enable anassessment of how well-positioned a counterparty is to manage the risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. This data enables capturing the “green” or the “non-green” (high-emitting) dimension of a portfolio, which is a fundamental question for assessing transition risks, as they increase with the share of ”non-green” exposures or decrease with the share of ”green” exposures. When data on companies’ practices are unavailable, financial institutions can also use predicted metrics which approximate how  material, etc.), engaging with borrowers and communities on their risk exposure and risk management,  or adjusting holdings within a portfolio to balance risk.  For example, lenders can engage with mortgage applicants around their asset's climate risk exposure  so chat they understand the risks they are caking and the true costs associated with the asset. Lenders  can encourage home buyers to invest in resilience measures that will increase the viability of the  mortgage while decreasing their own financial risk exposure. Likewise, lenders may be able to work  with loan insurance or mortgage insurance to reduce premiums, e.g., if a homebuyer paid a higher  price for a more resilient home (or if the homebuyer implements their own resilience measures that  meet certain resilience standards).

With respect to managing transition risk in their portfolio, we believe it is also important for the  institutions co collect data on GHG emissions footprint, emissions reductions plans, business models,  physical risk management plans and ocher relevant metrics which enable an assessment of how well- positioned a counterparty is to manage the risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon  economy. This data enables capturing the ""green"" or the ""non-green"" (high-emitting) dimension of a  portfolio, which is a fundamental question for assessing transition risks, as they increase with the share  of ""non-green"" exposures or decrease with the share of ""green"" exposures. When data on companies'  practices are unavailable, financial institutions can also use predicted metrics which approximate how 
       well a company is managing the risks. These predicted metrics facilitate portfolio screening for risk identification.6Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?We support the ongoing work on a global level to address climate-related credit risks for lending, insuranceand investment institutions, as important actors of the economy. We believe regulatory requirements should be harmonizedas much as possible in order to provide effectivity and legal certainty for the markets. We are of the opinion that the clarification of quantitativemetrics for financial institutionsto use to report on their exposure to physical and transition risk in regulatory frameworks can help to drive meaningful climate risk assessment and disclosure. For example, for physical risks, it is important to focus on identifying high-risk assets rather than averaging risk in a portfolio, as average risk can mask meaningful exposure to extreme conditions at individual assets. Incorporating property level physical risk profile such as climate risk score into existing credit risk models is crucial in deriving the climate-adjusted probability of defaults(PDs)and loss given defaults (LGDs)for mortgages, which can in turn inform meaningful disclosure.Further, while heat maps are a useful starting point, they have limitations as tools for concentration risk analysis in that they typically don’t reflect the correlations between and within segments. For instance, a location may have high levels of risks related to cyclones but not cause much concentration risk if the exposure to that location is low and cyclone risks in that location have low correlations with other risks relevant to the portfolio (e.g., cyclones in other locations). Traditional heatmaps can be extended to also reflect the correlations between the segment-specific risk in question and other risks relevant to the portfolio, making them more meaningful for disclosure.The appendix of the TCFD report Implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures released in October 2021,provides additional examples of forward-looking metrics for physical and transition risk that could inform disclosure guidance.   6 See Licari, Juan et al. “ESG Score Predictor: Applying a Quantitative Approach for Expanding Company Coverage,”  Moody’s white paper, July 2021: https://assets.website- files.com/5df9172583d7eec04960799a/60ebeb09c292affa13ff4a0e_ESG%20Score%20Predictor_090721.pdf  well a company is managing the risks. These predicted metrics facilitate portfolio screening for risk  identification.6  Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture  financial institutions' exposure to climate-related financial risks?

       F. Scenario Analysis Question 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face?The scenarios of the Network for Greening the Financial Systemhave emerged as common templates for scenario analysis globally. Leveraging these scenarios as a starting point helps to improve standardization and comparability across different regions and can help lower the barriers to entry for institutions. Building from these scenarios, institutionscan then consider creating custom climate scenarios that are tailored to their business models, exposures and strategy to stress test their holdings. Prescribing specific scenarios, particularly those thatleveragestandardized scenarios and widely adopted scenarios, isan important first step. However, results from a custom climate scenario can reveal weaknesses that may otherwise not show up in the standardized regulatory scenarios, and they can be more relevant in evaluating the financial institutions’risk management objectiveswhich makes them an important next step. Question 14: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis exercises?In a stress testing exercise, firmsoften need to expand on the prescribed regulatory scenarios to include more detailed concepts and more granular geographic coverage to tailor to their own exposures. Usually, for a given scenario, the economic model is calibrated by taking the variable paths specified by the scenario and setting the key levers of the model to reproduce the scenario’s paths. In the context of climate risk scenarios, it is important to re-evaluate the economic model to see if the model equations are specified based on economic theory, and they feature shock properties that are essential in scenario construction, including the creation of economic forecasts consistent with different climate change assumptions. Adding climate related scenario levers such as carbon taxes, emissions and fuel consumption to the economic model should also be considered to allow for a direct linkage between climate risks and the economy. We support the adoption of scenario analysis and climate stress tests in the near term, although we also acknowledge that they will continue to evolve and improve as these models are continuously refined.We also recognize that it is vital for regulators to necessitate short-term assessments which set out an organization’sexposure to the financial risks from acute physical risk within its existing business planning horizon. Answering questions like “what impact would a cyclone in Florida have on my portfolio?” would, among other uses cases, help an institution stress test its capital planning. F.

Answering questions like ""what impact would a q clone in Florida have on my  portfolio?"" would, among other uses cases, help an institution stress test its capital planning.","Moody's ESG Solutions (MESG) submitted a public comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. MESG, in collaboration with Moody's Analytics, supports the integration of climate-related financial risks into underwriting and portfolio management, emphasizing the need for continued research to incorporate climate risk factors into financial modeling. They propose expanding economic capital frameworks to include climate-related credit risks and suggest that these principles apply to institutions of all sizes, with smaller institutions potentially more vulnerable due to localized portfolios. MESG advocates for additional guidance on metrics for assessing and disclosing physical and transition risks, and highlights the importance of data on geographical footprints and greenhouse gas emissions for managing these risks. They also discuss the need for harmonized regulatory requirements and scenario analysis to improve climate risk management. MESG emphasizes the importance of considering the impacts of climate-related financial risks on disadvantaged communities and suggests engaging with local governments to mitigate these impacts. They support the use of scenario analysis and stress tests to evaluate financial institutions' risk management strategies."

INTERNATIONAL BANCSHARES  CORPORATION  June 3, 2022  Via email: Comments@fdic.gov  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary  Attn: Comments- RIN 3064-ZA32  550 17th Street N.W.  Washington, D.C. 20429  Re:  Comments on Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions (RIN 3064-ZA31)  Dear Sir:  The following comments are submitted by International Bancshares Corporation (""IBC""),  a publicly-traded, multi-bank financial holding company headquartered in Laredo, Texas.  IBC maintains 167 facilities and 261 ATMs, serving 75 communities in Texas and  Oklahoma through five separately chartered banks (""IBC Banks"") ranging in size from  approximately $480 million to $9.3 billion, with consolidated assets totaling over $16  billion. IBC is one of the largest independent commercial bank holding companies  headquartered in Texas.  This letter responds to the request for comment by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (""FDIC"") related to the FDIC's Statement of Principles for Climate-Related  Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (""Statement""). The Statement  contains draft principles that would provide a high-level framework for the safe and sound  management of exposures to climate-related financial risks for large banks with over $100  billion in assets. The FDIC wants to implement these principles in order to ""support efforts  by large financial institutions to focus on key aspects of climate-related financial risk  management."" [Statement at 19507]  The statement outlines two primary climate-related risks: physical risks and transition  risks. According to the FDIC,  Physical risks generally refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute,  climate-related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, and  chronic shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in  precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. Transition risks  generally refer to stresses to certain financial institutions or sectors arising from  the shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated  with the changes necessary to limit climate change. [Statement at 19508]  IBC has provided general comments and comments to the specific requests as noted  below.  709078.000074 4895-2182-5057.4  1  P.O. DRAWER 1359, LAREDO, TEXAS 78042-1359 {956) 722-7611  IBC-6011-01 
General Comments  The FDIC and other federal regulators should be careful not to conflate ""climate change""  and climate-related risk. Any implementation of the principles or other related regulatory  requirements needs to clearly define ""climate-related risk."" Many articles and studies on  climate-related risk focus on any number of future timelines and speculate on widely  differing scenarios about how ""climate change"" may affect climate-related risk. Using  these two terms coextensively is a mistake. The existence, extent, and effects of ""climate  change"" remain the subject of a continuing debate, data collection and evaluation.  Climate science is in its infancy. IBC does not dispute that wildfires, hurricanes, and other  destructive weather events may be leading to increased climate-related risks. However,  it is important for the FDIC to be clear and accurate with its terminology in this space. This  is especially important in order for insured institutions to understand exactly what the  FDIC's goals are. Is it the case the FDIC is primarily concerned with, in its opinion,  addressing ""climate change"" or the threat of climate-related risk related to insured banks'  stability? These are two vastly different issues that would require significantly different  plans and implementations, to say nothing of the fact that the FDIC, as a financial  regulator, generally should not be engaging in environmental policymaking.  The FDIC has a solution in search of a problem. Existing FDIC rules and guidance already  provide a comprehensive risk management and safety and soundness framework for  insured banks. [Statement at 19509] The risks the FDIC notes in the Statement are not  fundamentally novel or unique. Regarding physical risk, hurricane alley exists. Flood  zones exist. Tornado zones exist. Regarding transition risk, automobiles and the internet  were invented and categorically changed our lives and the financial system of this  country. Historically, banks have taken these realities into consideration in all of their  activities, from consumer lending to merchant banking investments. It would be criminal  ineptitude if the largest bank lenders to fossil fuel companies did not consider the  changing economy and rise of renewable energy as a challenge to such markets as a  matter of course. The FDIC seems to believe climate-related risk is an ephemeral threat  that is otherwise not on the radar of insured banks. IBC is confident this is far from the  truth. Climate-related risks are merely another case of changing times requiring a re- evaluation of the market landscape at both a micro and macro level, a process that banks  have engaged in since the dawn of the modern financial system. The threat of  environmental risks is not new, it is merely changing. Like all geographic changes, banks  will learn to adapt or will face the consequences, like every other business. Did the FDIC  step in with highly burdensome principles and guidelines when the internet threatened to  throw our economy into upheaval? Did the FDIC step in when horse and buggy  businesses faced obsolescence from automobile manufacturers? Or did the FDIC leave  it to the banks' discretion in considering these economic realities when engaging with  those businesses and markets? This is no different than traditional oil and gas companies  facing increased uncertainty due to competing renewable alternatives. Unless the FDIC  thinks these risks fundamentally endanger the insurance fund, it should not attempt to  strong-arm a climate agenda onto insured depository institutions.  Banks are well-practiced in adapting to and managing changes in consumer market  preferences and the commercial environment. Climate-related financial risks are already  2 
naturally embedded into this risk assessment process through the dynamic market,  economic, and counterparty data that are the backbone of robust risk management. As  the policy goals, definitions, and methodologies behind climate-related financial risk  identification evolve, banks of all sizes will continue to apply traditional credit and financial  risk tolerances and parameters to their balance sheets to manage their risks and support  the customers and communities they serve. The heavy hand of regulators is not needed  to ensure adequate consideration by insured banks.  Banks, like all other businesses in this country, will begin to factor in additional climate  considerations throughout their activities as applicable. These principles should not be  foisted upon banks in an attempt to create an artificial response instead of allowing the  response to grow and be addressed naturally. The free market should be left to address  any climate-related risks and the changing economy, and stakeholders should be left to  adjust their policies and practices over time to adapt to these changes. Time will also  reveal through innovation new ways to adapt to the changes and any challenges.  IBC also urges the FDIC to work in close conjunction with the other banking and financial  agencies and international standard setting bodies to address climate-related risk,  including closing data gaps and applying a consistent set of definitions, assumptions and  methodologies. Notably, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities  Exchange Commission have both recently published proposed guidance and new rules  related to climate risk. The FDIC should work with these and other federal regulators to  ensure that any climate risk guidance and rules are conformed and harmonized between  the various regulatory frameworks that apply to insured banks. This is especially true of  the National Credit Union Administration, as banks should not (again) be subject to  onerous regulatory obligations that their tax-advantaged credit union counterparts are not.  Climate-related risk should not be another area in which banks face a huge disadvantage  compared to credit unions, primarily driven by regulatory malpractice.  Additionally, the principles single out climate-related risk from other risks for unnecessary  special treatment. Insured banks no longer may simply treat climate-related risk as they  would any other risk. Instead, the principles would require banks to specifically focus on  climate-related risk in a variety of ways. For instance,  1. Banks must communicate about climate-related risks in particular, must specially  assign responsibilities for them ""throughout the organization,""  and must be  reported by bank management to the board. [Statement at 19509]  2. Climate-related risk is singled out for assessment with regard to ""stakeholders'  expectations, the bank's reputation, and ... disadvantaged households and  communities."" [Statement at 1951 O]  3. Banks must ""incorporate climate-related risks into their internal control  frameworks, including internal audit,"" regardless of whether those risks would  qualify for control or audit coverage under the procedures that the banks have  reasonably adopted for other sorts of risk. [Statement at 1951 O]  4. Bank management must ""develop and implement ...  scenario analysis  frameworks"" for climate-related risks but not for other risks. [Statement at 19510]  3 
5. Banks are to ""consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting  and ongoing monitoring of portfolios."" [Statement at 19510]  Singling-out climate-related risk for these additional and heightened analyses and  obligations is unjustifiable. Climate-related risks do not pose greater risk than, for  example, technological disruption, economic downturns, domestic political changes,  foreign conflicts, civic unrest, changing consumer preference, and public health crises.  IBC is especially concerned that federal regulators are choosing to focus on issues that  are not critically important to financial institutions, while ignoring problems that  fundamentally challenge the continued safety and soundness of regulated depository  institutions. For example, changes in consumer protection regulations, financial services  technology, and the Uniform Commercial Code have greatly increased the risk of fraud  and unauthorized transactions, and the potential liability of financial institutions related to  those risks. Instead of climate-related risk, financial institutions and their customers would  be much better served if regulators could focus on and address the increased fraud risks  and related liabilities. Even if climate-related risk is one of the most important risks for  certain institutions, that is not true for all insured banks, let alone the vast majority of those  banks. Banks would be encouraged, potentially required, to exclude entire geographies  and markets that are implicated in climate-related risks. By singling out climate-related  risk for special attention and treatment, the principles would prompt banks to deny  financial services and credit, or offer such on worse terms, to consumers and businesses  that might be affected by climate-related risk. This would be de-risking on steroids. This  includes the entirety of the traditional energy and agricultural sectors, other industries that  are carbon-intensive, or consume large amounts of water, energy, and other resources  or produce, supply, or consume fertilizer and chemicals, or generate waste, as well as  others that may be alleged to be at risk from possible changes in law or public opinion  regarding climate-related risk. There would be no clearer example of the government  picking and choosing winners and losers in the economy writ large. This is patently  unacceptable. Because the principles require banks to consider climate-related risks to  ""the bank's reputation,"" banks would be forced to consider whether loan applicants  viewed favorably by ""green activists"" or are ""green enough."" [Statement at 19511] Banks  may interpret the principles to require that they lend only to businesses that make certain  ""green commitments"" (e.g. net-zero emissions by 2030, etc.). Businesses that are  accused of or perceived as harming the climate or not being ""green"" enough may find it  hard to obtain credit or reasonable loan terms. Banks may even refuse to provide  standard transactional and deposit services to businesses that are no in favor with climate  activists.  Finally, IBC notes that climate-related risks and impacts are actually not all detrimental to  banks, and can actually increase the health and stability of a bank's operations. In fact, a  study published by the Federal Reserve found that weather disasters have not, in fact,  damaged banks' bottom lines in any material way, and concluded that weather disasters  are not likely to be a material source of bank instability, regardless of the size of the bank.1  1 See "" How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks?"" available at  (https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr990.pdf); and ""How Bad Are  Weather Disasters for Banks? Not Very, Study Finds,"" available at  4 
The Federal Reserve found that, between 1995 and 2018, increased lending by banks  heavily concentrated in geographic areas affected by natural disasters and major weather  events actually increased the banks' profitability and only caused modest increases in  loan-loss rates. After large weather disasters, both consumers and businesses may need  credit to rebuild and repair. Earnings on new loans related to these destructive events  can offset losses on prior loans and ultimately strengthen a bank's balance sheet, to say  nothing of the good these new loans do for the community re-building efforts.  Specific Requests for Information  A. Applicability  Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model,  should inform financial institutions' adoption of these principles?  IBC Comment: IBC strongly urges the FDIC to make clear that these principles  will not be applicable to or held against institutions with less than $100 billion in  assets, which amount should be indexed for annual future increase. IBC also asks  that the FDIC exempt minority-owned depository institutions and community  development institutions from the principles. These institutions largely serve rural  and underserved communities and would be completely hamstrung if additional  restrictions on their ability to lend or provide services to these populations were  implemented. Defining and quantifying climate-related impacts on traditional bank  risks is a relatively new and complex process. Given all of the uncertainties, and  to accommodate what will likely be significant changes to the practice of climate- related financial risk identification, IBC urges the FDIC to continue to take a  principles-based approach that is flexible and iterative, and that allows banks to  assess the risks they identify as the most material to their unique circumstances.  IBC requests that the FDIC not expand the scope of the principles to these banks  until more robust data is available, and the climate-related financial risks and  opportunities are better understood.  As a general note, the complexity of what is being proposed and asked of insured  banks regarding measuring, monitoring, and controlling climate-related risks can  only be met by the largest financial institutions. The level of difficulty of expertise,  to say nothing of the time and costs, required is simply outside the capabilities of  small and mid-sized community banks. This will no doubt be a boon for ""climate  consultants"" who will start aggressively marketing their services to financial  https://www.newsdesk.lexisnexis.com/click/?p=aHROcHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c2Rlc2subGV4aXNuZXhpcy5j  b20vYXJOaWNsZS80NzQOMjE50TkzMy5odG1sP2hsaD02NWZINTdkYyZmaWQ9MTl1MDEONCZjaWQ  9lVRBM09ESTQmdWlkPU 1UTXdNVGd6&a=47 442199933&f=UHJpbnQ&s:::YWxlcnQ&u=am1 leWVyQG  R5a2VtYS5jb20&cn=RHlrZW1hlEdvc3NldHQgUExMQw&ci=107828&i=335&si:::72083&fmi=654543496&  e:::QW1 lcmljYW4gQmFua2Vy&d=130183&t=3&h=1 &mbc=Q1 QzL2E9NDcONDlxOTk5MzMmcDOxNGUm  djOxJnM9MSZobGg9NjVmZTU3ZGMmZmlkPTEyNTAxNDQmeD1 RMFd6eDILbjdhWFZXL TRwVW96NVI  3JnUxPU5EJnUyPXVwLXVybj p 1 c2Vy01 BBNTUzNjg4NQ&fi::: 1250144&ai=226734&wa= 1 &ac=226734_ 1  649246884000&ck=a91 f070fdb67f2652ac5bd 1 e6800fead  5 
institutions. Notably, the FDIC received at least one comment letter from such a  climate science consultant, which unsurprisingly included a full-throated  endorsement of the Statement and went as far to ask that the FDIC ""explicitly  require financial institutions to research, outline, and detail the correlation between  climate risks and the financial risks to which they are exposed, and provide  transparency into the data utilized to validate any assumptions that underlie their  models."" [Comment Letter of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.] Bankers should not  need a doctorate-level understanding of climate science in order to do their jobs.  Instead of focusing on creating jobs and helping local businesses, these principles  will simply spur bank ""investment"" in consulting firms in order to meet these new  requirements. It must also be pointed out there are many experts that do not  believe the science is settled when it comes to climate change. In fact, the ability  to forecast or model climate change is believed to be highly suspect. That is clearly  set out in ""Unsettled,"" a book authored by Steven E. Koonin, a climate expert.  B. Tailoring  Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its  climate-related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size,  complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations?  IBC Comment: Future guidance will be absolutely necessary as the principles as  they currently exist are esoteric to the point of confusion, and do not offer any  concrete methodologies for how a small or mid-sized bank can even begin to start  addressing the issues involved. Future guidance will need to ensure that bankers  do not require a climate science degree to understand and implement the required  principles. It is critical that the FDIC seek frequent public input from banks of all  sizes to ensure supervisory goals and expectations align with current capabilities,  are properly calibrated to the risks, and regulations do not penalize bank  customers or the communities banks support.  Banks of all sizes must identify, monitor, and manage their risks. IBC highly  recommends that any forthcoming regulation will be tailored to reflect differences  in banks' circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.  Banks of differing sizes and complexity are engaged in different combinations of  activities, which in turn present a wide variety of risk profiles. This is also the case  with climate-related financial risks, with the added challenge of significant  uncertainty around definitions, data, and the capacity to build necessary systems  and expertise, as discussed herein. Many of the largest institutions are devoting  significant resources to better understand how to assess and integrate climate- related financial risks, while many smaller institutions are still trying to determine if  they have exposure based on current models and definitions, and if so, what it may  mean for their institution, their customers and their communities. Additionally,  smaller institutions rely on third parties for data, analysis, and reporting, so they  will need additional time to quantify and assess their climate-related financial risks.  6 
As argued herein, IBC asks that the FDIC not make the climate principles  applicable to small and mid-sized institutions until climate-related financial risk is  more precisely identified and understood, the methodologies have evolved, and  the FDIC can provide robust guidance and requirements. Future supervisory  expectations or further regulation will need to be calibrated for smaller institutions,  mitigating any negative impact on their communities.  Finally, one of the biggest challenges community banks would face in complying  with and implementing the principles is anticipating, measuring, forecasting, and  analyzing unknown and unquantifiable risks. The principles are incredibly broad  and lack specificity to help small and mid-sized banks and examiners identify  material climate-related financial risks that may warrant review and heightened  scrutiny. As currently proposed, IBC believes the principles do not contain  sufficient protections that would ensure examiners do not get carried away in  criticizing healthy banks on the basis of remote, highly speculative, or immaterial  climate-related risks. The principles also do not contain defined terms, detailed  hypothetical or explanatory examples, time periods for forecasting, or even a  common data set banks could use to analyze climate related financial risks.  Without these limits, the principles can broadly apply to every type of climate- related physical risk or transition risk imaginable, no matter how immaterial or  remote, and banks could therefore be subject to undue regulatory scrutiny and  enforcement actions for minor and immaterial deficiencies in their risk  management programs. The resources and costs that would be necessary to  comply with the principles would quickly overwhelm a community banks' limited  staff or force a community bank to de-risk entire industries or loan portfolios even  if the bank had no true safety and soundness weaknesses.  C. General  Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft  principles into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with  financial institutions to understand those challenges?  IBC Comment: To start with, the FDIC should make clear how these principles  should be incorporated into risk management systems. The FDIC already has  ample risk management regulations and guidance, as previously noted. To the  extent it feels the need to include these principles in that framework, it should carry  the laboring oar in order to do so. Banks already consider climate issues, such as  increased wildfire and flood risks, when evaluating transactions as part of their risk  management. If the FDIC wants to include these principles, or parts of them,  formally into its risk management requirements and guidance, it should do so itself.  Question 4: Would regulations or guidelines prescribing particular risk management  practices be helpful to financial institutions as they adjust to doing business in a changing  climate?  7 
IBC Comment: As always, clear and concise guidance from regulators is  necessary to enable banks to meet regulator expectations and provide stability to  the federal regulatory framework. Banks want to comply with regulatory  expectations, but it is nigh impossible if there is not sufficient guidance and  cooperation from regulators regarding their expectations. Especially given the  nascent stage of climate science and climate-related risk assessment,  comprehensive and flexible regulatory guidance will be necessary if the FDIC  chooses to impose climate-related risk obligations on insured banks.  Question 5: What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to  successfully incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management  frameworks?  IBC Comment: As noted elsewhere herein, banks are already incorporating  climate risk in their risk assessment and management frameworks. As they have  done since our modern financial system was created, banks are adapting to the  changing economy and geographic realities without a mandate from regulators.  Markets change. Economies change. Land use changes. Climate-related risks are  not a uniquely new, insurmountable hurdle for banks to address without the  overbearing hand of regulators directing the way. Perhaps there is no one ""right""  way forward to address climate risks. In fact, there certainly is not, especially when  insured banks come in so many different sizes, locations, and specialties. The  FDIC should strive to provide guidance that is flexible and broadly adaptable by  banks of all types. Risk assessment and management is not broken, so there is  nothing to fix. Banks, as always, are constantly adapting based on new market  realities and changes without the need for regulator management.  Question 6: How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial risks  are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?  Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying  and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?  IBC Comment: Insured banks are highly-regulated financial institutions that are  key providers of liquidity within an economy that must support individuals,  companies, and communities in the immediate-, short-, intermediate-, and long- terms, often in the context of financing economic transition and avoiding the harm  that will come to communities if financing of businesses and industries essential to  local economies is abruptly or unnecessarily curtailed. A careful balance must be  achieved that recognizes the potential effects of climate-related risk, but does not  trigger actual transition risks harmful to the economy.  Some risks are considered in the short to medium term (1-3 years), such as  reputation, extreme weather, and public policy risks. Other risks are considered  over a longer time horizon, such as business, market sector, and geographic  8 
concentrations, demographic changes, operational resiliency, and geopolitical  trends. Climate-related credit risks should be considered on a time horizon  commensurate with the nature of the underwriting, transaction, and collateral. Time  horizons for climate-related risks should generally be tied to the underlying  transaction. For example, for short-duration loans and other instruments, the  appropriate time horizon may be current exposure and the exposure at 1 or 2 years  out. For mortgage-related assets, the 7- and 10-year time horizons are common  points of analysis and projection, while certain real estate transactions tend to look  at 10- to 30-year time horizons.  But defining and quantifying the impacts of climate-related risks on traditional bank  risks is a relatively new and complex process, with the assumptions backing the  analyses dependent on a vast number of policy choices and outcomes, over  timeframes that extend far beyond those used to assess traditional banking risks.  Climate-related risks are inherently tied to government action and policy, which is  simply unpredictable on a macro, long-term timeline. Will combustion engines  eventually be banned? Will sweeping changes to off-shore drilling rights and  permits be enacted in the next five years? It is impossible to know, but comfortingly,  it has always been that way. Banks have learned to assess risk in an ever- changing American economy. To the extent the FDIC is set on implementing these  principles, it should make clear what time horizons would be applicable to the  underlying transactions and should acknowledge the complicated and dependent  nature of such time horizons as applied to climate risk.  Question 8: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies - for example,  insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments - do financial  institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks?  IBC Comment: IBC generally does not use specific products to hedge, transfer,  or mitigate its climate-related risks outside of standard insurance products (e.g.  flood insurance).  Question 9: What, if any, climate-related financial products or services - for example,  ""green bonds,"" derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take  climate-related considerations into account - do financial institutions offer to clients and  customers? What risks, if any, do these products or services pose?  IBC Comment: IBC does not currently offer climate-related financial products.  Because of the dearth of accepted facts, data, and methodologies, these products  pose risks related to accurately pricing future climate impacts from both physical  and transition risks.  Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate- related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and  communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Should the  agencies modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the  9 
Community Reinvestment Act, to address the impact climate-related financial risks may  have on LMI and other disadvantaged communities?  IBC Comment: These climate principles will absolutely do more consumer harm  than good. In fact, it is difficult to see how both consumers and small businesses  will not be harmed if these principles are adopted. For example, how are banks to  provide sufficient access to credit and banking services to rural and poor  communities in ""climate-affected"" areas? How can banks provide affordable  consumer and small business credit in areas prone to climate-related risk? Areas  prone to fire and flooding are already populated largely by poor and middle class  consumers, as are areas of higher pollution and those in close proximity to super- fund sites.2 Are banks no longer encouraged to engage with rural customers in  these areas? As certain areas become more prone to fire and flooding, are banks  to simply ignore the needs of those communities? How are banks supposed to  meet their Community Reinvestment Act requirements if they cannot engage with  these populations in a fulsome manner? Even the FDIC notes that ""[a]dverse  effects could include potentially disproportionate impact on the financially  vulnerable, including low- to moderate-income and other disadvantaged  households and communities."" [Statement at 19509] These principles will have a  negative impact on persistently impoverished areas, areas of minority populations,  and low to moderate income tracts. Simply put, the FD I C's principles would create  a ""green-lining"" problem where institutions may refuse to lend to and service  consumers in climate-affected areas. This could be the new redlining of the 21 st  century. This is to say nothing of the potential negative financial impacts these  individuals will face if banks are restricted, or even prohibited from, lending to  certain businesses and industries due to perceived climate-related risk. These  individuals may face job loss or decreased salaries, in addition to a further erosion  of their communities as businesses move to find more hospitable geographic  markets.  The FDIC needs to consider how it will implement climate risk guidance and  requirements in a way that banks are not punished for making loans in climate risk- implicated areas, on one hand, and also not punished for not lending in majority- minority and LMI tracts because of climate-related risks on the other hand. If  climate risk obligations are not implemented thoughtfully and carefully, banks will  face a Catch-22 no-win scenario regarding their activities in areas facing the most  climate-related risk.  E. Data, Disclosures, and Reporting  Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models from  borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure,  monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial institutions  2 See, EPA, ""Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States,"" September 2021; available at  https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021-09/climate-vulnerability_september-2021_508.pdf  10 
currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to  these data, metrics, tools or models?  IBC Comment: As noted herein, any climate-related risk principles or guidance  will almost certainly benefit the consultants that banks will be required to engage  and rely on, as bankers are not climate scientists. Many of the largest banks are  currently conducting climate-specific qualitative assessments, developing internal  models, and incorporating forward-looking, climate-related considerations into  strategy and new business assessment. As a practical matter, this nascent stage  of climate-related risk assessment means that banks are in the earliest stages of  exploring how to refine and adapt their management of climate-related financial  risks. For example, there is an absence of robust market data related to climate- related financial risk, a lack of standardized definitions surrounding what is meant  by climate-related risk, and limited information about how climate-related risk  interacts with traditional financial risks. The FDIC should proceed with care, and  avoid being ""too early"" on this matter, and implementing a framework that will  stagnate and become obsolete in a short time.  IBC believes that regulators should focus on ensuring that the largest, systemically  important banks are progressing in their climate-related risk assessment  capabilities and conducting internal climate-related risk analysis calibrated to the  risks that are material to their individual business model. Attaching regulatory  consequences to climate-related risk exposures at this time would be premature.  Additional regulation based on today's climate science and risk assessment  capabilities could potentially result in a misallocation of resources.  Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better  capture financial institutions' exposure to climate-related financial risks?  IBC Comment: If it must act, the FDIC should implement a modest set of general  principles and requirements for the largest insured institutions in order to  understand the effect such obligations may have on those institutions, small and  mid-sized institutions, and the nation's economy. Those findings should inform any  additional implementation of a more comprehensive climate-related risk  framework. Regulatory reporting requirements should scale with the size, clientele,  and complexity of the bank.  F. Scenario Analysis  Question 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management  that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial  institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they  face?  IBC Comment: Scenario analysis is typically a forward-looking assessment of a  potential future state of the world (or a specific section of it) over time, resulting  11 
from a plausible and possibly adverse set of assumed events or sequence of  assumed events. Scenario analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise  that should not be mandatory for community banks. To perform mandatory  scenario analysis, small and mid-sized community banks would likely need to hire  specialized consultants to perform the work. Even conservative estimates for an  independent audit can exceed $100,000. Because climate science is in its infancy,  there are few individuals and firms qualified to perform climate-related risk scenario  analyses. The demand for these services, if scenario analysis is mandatory for  community banks, would only drive up the costs of these audits and exercises.  Small and mid-sized banks cannot afford to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars  to third party consultants to perform climate-related risk scenario analyses,  particularly if these analyses are evaluating immaterial or remote climate-related  financial risks or are unlikely to result in any measurable changes to business  operations.  The accuracy and effectiveness of scenario analysis depends on the availability of  high-quality data, as well as advancements in modeling over medium and long  time horizons. However, given the immature state of modeling, including both the  availability of appropriate quality data and the modeling, detailed disclosure of the  assumptions used and projected financial impacts (i.e., the results) of scenario  analysis performed by banks are likely to be highly unreliable for the foreseeable  future. Any principles or guidelines should make clear that scenario analysis is just  one tool to be used in enhancing climate-related financial risk management. The  FDIC should make clear that scenario analysis is a separate exercise, distinct from  traditional stress testing, and is not intended to affect capital requirements or  supervisory actions. Any attempt to include scenario analysis into stress tests or  capital requirements are premature and would create confusion based on how  these nascent data sets and methodologies would influence current capital  requirements.  IBC recommends that until climate-related risks are better understood, and more  market and economic data is available, any climate scenario analysis be  performed using banks' internal models and processes.  Question 14: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and  executing scenario analysis exercises?  12 
While IBC appreciates the FDIC's use of principles rather than detailed or prescriptive  rules, IBC encourages the FDIC to continue to employ a flexible and iterative approach.  This will allow banks to adapt their risk management to their most material issues and to  adjust to the rapidly evolving climate-risk policy and practice environment.  Thank you for the opportunity to share IBC's view.  INTERNATIONAL B NCSHARES CORPORATION  President and CEO  13","International Bancshares Corporation (IBC) submitted comments on the FDIC's draft principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. IBC argues that the FDIC should not conflate 'climate change' with 'climate-related risk' and should clearly define the latter. They believe existing FDIC rules already cover risk management adequately and that climate-related risks are not novel. IBC suggests that banks are already adept at adapting to market changes, including climate risks, without regulatory intervention. They caution against imposing burdensome regulations that could disadvantage smaller banks and argue that the free market should address climate risks naturally. IBC also emphasizes the need for the FDIC to collaborate with other regulatory bodies to ensure consistent guidelines. They express concern that singling out climate risks could lead to banks denying services to certain sectors, potentially harming disadvantaged communities. IBC recommends that the FDIC's principles should not apply to smaller banks until more robust data is available and that any future guidance should be flexible and tailored to different bank sizes and complexities."

      February 14, 2022  The Honorable Michael J. Hsu  Acting Comptroller of the Currency   Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  400 7th Street SW  Washington, DC 20219  RE:  MBA Feedback on Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Banks  Dear Acting Comptroller Hsu:  The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)1 appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Office  of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) invitation to provide feedback on its draft Principles  for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (hereinafter “Draft Principles”).2   MBA is the national association representing the real state finance industry, including banks with  over $100 billion in consolidated assets. Our response, therefore, reflects a focus on the mortgage  lending and servicing activities of covered banks, including commercial, multifamily, and single- family mortgage lending and servicing. Specifically, we are focused on the impact of climate- related events that could result in increases in the credit risk associated with mortgages – and  how these risks are managed.   I.  OVERVIEW  The OCC issued the Draft Principles to address its concern that banks’ exposure to climate- related financial risks could affect the safety and soundness of banks and the overall financial  system.   From the perspective of mortgage lending and servicing, MBA agrees with the general principle  that climate-related impacts to credit risk can be analyzed across various dimensions, including  sectoral and geographic, to assess both current and possible future credit risk exposure from  physical and transition risks, including concentrations of risk.    1 The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) is the national association representing the real estate finance  industry, an industry that employs more than 390,000 people in virtually every community in the country.

  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 2  MBA also appreciates that the OCC is considering a principles-based rather than prescriptive  approach, and is focused on leveraging existing risk management frameworks rather than calling  for an entirely new framework. We urge the OCC to encourage other supervisors to adopt a similar  approach, and we also urge supervisors to recognize that this an evolving area with an evolving  understanding of the risks.  With respect to scenario analysis, we support the OCC’s distinction between climate scenario  analysis and regulatory stress testing and urge the OCC to recognize the exploratory nature of  scenario analysis given the limited availability and nascent state of methodologies and models.  Relatedly, the OCC should recognize that time horizons that may be appropriate for any particular  scenario analysis will be a function of the purpose of each analysis, the context of the analysis,  and possibly the availability of data.  II.  THE PROPOSED PRINCIPLES  The Draft Principles arise from the OCC’s concern that “[w]eaknesses in how banks identify,  measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and transition risks associated with a  changing climate could adversely affect a bank’s safety and soundness, as well as the overall  financial system.” The OCC describes those physical and transition risks as follows:  Physical risks refer to the harm to people and property arising from acute, climate- related events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, and chronic  shifts in climate, including higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation  patterns, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.   Transition risks refer to stresses to certain banks or sectors arising from the shifts  in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the  changes necessary to limit climate change.3  The OCC’s Draft Principles address those concerns by providing a high-level framework for the  safe and sound management of climate-related financial risks by large banks, “consistent with the  existing risk management framework described in existing OCC rules and guidance.”4 That  framework includes general principles for:   •  Governance;   •  Policies, procedures, and limits;   •  Strategic planning;  •  Risk management;   •  Data, risk measurement, and reporting; and   •  Scenario analysis.   The Draft Principles also apply those general principles across the established risk areas of credit  risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, legal/compliance risk, and other financial and non-financial risk.   Following its consideration of feedback on the Draft Principles as well as lessons learned and  best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions, the OCC plans to issue guidance that    3 Draft Principles at p. 1.  4 Id.  
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 3  would address the respective roles and responsibilities of boards of directors and management  and, consistent with the OCC’s risk-based approach to supervision, “appropriately tailor any  resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’ circumstances such as  complexity of operations and business models.”5 A similar approach may be adopted by other  supervisors that oversee smaller banks, credit unions, independent mortgage banks, and other  institutions in the mortgage industry, in a manner commensurate with their exposures to climate- related financial risk.   III.  CLIMATE CHANGE, CREDIT RISK, AND MORTGAGES  The Draft Principles describe the OCC’s climate-related expectations around credit risk as follows:  Credit Risk. The board and management should consider climate-related financial  risks as part of the underwriting and ongoing monitoring of portfolios. Effective  credit risk management practices could include monitoring climate-related credit  risks through sectoral, geographic, and single-name concentration analyses,  including credit risk concentrations stemming from physical and transition risks. As  part of concentration risk analysis, management should assess potential changes  in correlations across exposures or asset classes. The board and management  should determine credit risk appetite and lending limits related to these risks.6   This discussion of credit risk in the Draft Principles is of interest to MBA and its members who are  engaged in mortgage finance. The impacts of climate-related physical and transition risks to  mortgages are likely to be experienced principally in the form of credit risk.7 Acute climate-related  events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, floods, heatwaves, and chronic shifts in climate, including  higher average temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, sea level rise, and ocean  acidification that result in damage to property securing a mortgage can result in unexpected costs  to borrowers or losses to income, and can reduce the value of the property, all of which increase  credit risk. Shifts in policy, consumer and business sentiment, or technologies associated with the  changes necessary to limit climate change can have similar impacts that also could increase  credit risk.  The general principle that climate-related impacts to credit risk can be analyzed across various  dimensions, including sectoral and geographic, to assess both current and possible future credit  risk exposure from physical and transition risks, including concentrations of risk, is reasonable as  applied to mortgage credit risk. To the extent that identified climate-related credit risk is material,    5 Id. at p. 2.  6 Id. at p. 4.  7 Any increased mortgage default risk due to climate-related events could interact with liquidity risk for  loans that are securitized, as well. Depending on the nature of the securitization, banks may be  contractually required to advance payments to investors, even if borrowers fail to make these payments.  Most of the current mortgage securitization market is comprised of loans and securities that include  insurance or guarantees from government agencies or government-sponsored enterprises. As such,  advanced payments typically are reimbursed by the relevant insurer or guarantor, though the entity  servicing these loans needs sufficient liquidity to make advances until reimbursement occurs. The  experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which millions of borrowers across the country exercised  forbearance and skipped payments, showed that banks were well-equipped to meet these short-term  liquidity demands. 
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 4  it would be reasonable for those risks to be reflected in applicable elements of a bank’s risk  appetite.  We note that geography inherently is a key factor when assessing the risk of a loan secured by  real property. Improvements over time in key tools, such as flood- or wildfire-risk maps and  models, should foster improvements in the quality of such assessments. Assessing chronic  physical risks, or transition risks such as those arising from changes in building emission  standards or changes in consumer taste, will be more challenging.8 While there may be a  geographic dimension to such risks, it may be more challenging to project appropriately stressful  and plausible scenarios as to where or how such transition risk events could unfold.   IV.  MBA FEEDBACK    In response to the OCC’s invitation, MBA respectfully provides feedback below on the overall  approach taken in the Draft Principles, scenario analysis, time horizons, and impacts on  households and communities.   A.  Overall approach  We appreciate the overall approach to climate-related financial risk reflected in the Draft  Principles. Climate-related financial risk is a long-standing risk factor that is likely growing more  acute and is, therefore, subject to increased attention and analysis. The collective  understanding of this risk, however, remains in its relative infancy. The OCC’s principles-based  approach is, therefore, welcome and preferable to a more prescriptive approach.  In the Draft Principles, the OCC also recognizes that addressing climate-related financial risk will  require banks to leverage and enhance their existing risk-management frameworks – and not  establish independent new frameworks for addressing this risk. While climate-related financial  risk is not fully understood, it is important to recognize that banks do not face that risk unarmed.  Consistent with its approach of leveraging existing risk-management frameworks, the Draft  Principles also do not treat emerging climate-related financial risk as a separate, new category of  risk. Rather, the Draft Principles recognize that climate change is a financial risk driver that may  manifest itself in impacts on established areas of risk: credit risk, liquidity risk, other financial risk,  operational risk, legal/compliance risk, and other non-financial risk.  We note that these elements of the OCC’s approach are consistent with the approaches across  prudential regulators described in a recent Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) report on  climate-related financial risk:9     8 A recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff report shares this view as to the relative challenge of  the different elements of climate change credit risk. See Blickle et al., How Bad Are Weather Disasters for  Banks?, NY Fed. Staff Report, p. 3 (Nov. 2021, rev. Jan. 2022) (“Our findings suggest that the acute,  physical risks to banks are not first-order. Banks’ resilience against such risks should reinforce the financial  system more broadly. More chronic physical risks and transition risks may warrant more focus.” (citation  omitted)); available at sr990.pdf (newyorkfed.org)  9 See FSOC Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, pp. 27-32 Oct. 21, 2021; available at  https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf.  
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 5  Regulators and supervisors of depository institutions—the FDIC, FRB, OCC,  NCUA, and state banking supervisors (depository institution regulators)—expect  supervised institutions to manage all material risks and undertake steps to operate  in compliance with laws and regulations and in a safe and sound manner. As noted  previously, climate-related financial risks may manifest through traditional  prudential risk categories that are supervised under safety and soundness  mandates.   As part of their supervisory activities, the depository institution regulators expect  to review within traditional prudential risk categories, as relevant, how effectively  institutions incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management  systems and frameworks, appropriate to their size, complexity, risk profile, and  location.10  These elements of the Draft Principles effectively put banks on notice that the OCC expects them  to be actively engaged in incorporating climate change risks into their existing risk-management  processes. In addition, they also provide room for banks to have the flexibility needed to continue  to develop approaches to identify, measure, monitor, and control the potential physical and  transition risks associated with a changing climate that are tailored to their respective institutions.   For these reasons, we urge the OCC to continue the high-level, principles-based approach  towards managing climate-change risk facing OCC-supervised banks and to work with other  prudential supervisors to encourage them to adopt an aligned approach to their supervision of  financial institutions’ management of climate-related financial risk.    We also urge the OCC to appropriately temper its expectations by balancing its intent to increase  banks’ efforts in the area of climate-related financial risk with the recognition that this an evolving  area and, as such, banks are at the early stages of learning to assess and understand the nature  of the associated risks. With such a balance, we urge the OCC to facilitate progress in banks’  efforts to integrate climate-related financial risk into their existing risk-management frameworks  by engaging in constructive dialogue at different stages with banks and sharing information on  applicable risk-management best practices. The Draft Principles may provide an appropriate  foundation for such initial constructive dialogue.  B.  Scenario analysis    One of the Draft Principles is that climate-related scenario analysis is emerging as an important  approach for identifying, measuring, and managing climate-related risks.11 As the OCC describes,  climate scenario analysis is a forward-looking assessment of the potential impact on a bank of  changes resulting from climate-related risks. In contrast to traditional regulatory stress tests,  climate-related scenario analyses may address a longer time horizon and explore various “what  if” paths rather than near-term changes to economic or financial conditions.     10 Id. at pp. 27-28.  11 Draft Principles at p. 4. 
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 6  We appreciate that the discussion of scenario analysis in the Draft Principles provides a  framework of expectations without specifying prescriptive requirements for any particular type of  scenario analysis.   •  Scenario analysis can be applied alongside existing risk management practices;  •  Climate-related scenario analysis frameworks should be commensurate to the bank’s size,  complexity, business activity, and risk profile;  •  Scenarios should include clearly defined objectives that reflect the bank’s overall climate  risk management strategies, which could include identifying and measuring vulnerability  to relevant climate-related risk factors, including physical and transition risks, and  estimating climate-related exposures and potential losses across a range of plausible  scenarios;  •  Climate-related scenario analyses should be subject to oversight, validation, and quality  control standards that would be commensurate to their risk; and   •  Climate-related scenario analysis results should be clearly and regularly communicated  to all relevant individuals within the bank, including an appropriate level of information  necessary to effectively convey the assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty of results.  This element of the Draft Principles might also usefully include recognition of the relative  immaturity of underlying data and methodologies. Many data providers, for example, are still in  the process of developing and expanding on datasets that banks can integrate into their  scenarios. As a result, banks may reasonably employ data assumptions or approximations to  analyze the impacts of some scenarios.   Consistent with the approach taken under Other Financial Risk, it would be useful to recognize  that banks necessarily will work with the methodologies and data that are reasonably available  and refine them over time.12 This particularly will be the case in scenario analyses designed to  assess exposure to transition risk – for example, arising from future changes to building emission  standards or changes in consumer tastes that could affect mortgage credit risk. We recognize, of  course, that the assumptions, limitations, and uncertainty of results with respect to any scenario  analyses should be documented and provided along with any communication of results, so that  decisionmakers can gauge the level of reliance they can reasonably place on those results.     12 See id. at p. 5 (Under heading Other Financial Risk: “While market participants are still researching how  to measure climate price risk, the board and management should use the best measurement methodologies  reasonably available to them and refine them over time.”). 
  MBA Response to Draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management   February 14, 2022  Page 7  C.  Time horizons  The Draft Principles raise the question of the appropriate time horizons for risk assessment both  in the context of determining when a climate-related financial risk is material13 and specifically in  the context of the discussion of scenario analysis.14   This raises the question of whether there may be any preferred time horizons that banks will be  expected to apply. There can be no single answer to that question. Time horizons can vary with  the specific purpose of the scenario analysis. A scenario analysis used to assess the risk of a  bank’s current mortgage portfolio, for example, may employ a time horizon that correlates with  the expected durations of the mortgages in that portfolio. A scenario analysis for the purpose of  assessing the risks of a bank’s business strategies, in contrast, may employ a much longer time  horizon. In effect, the appropriate time horizon will be affected by the purpose of the analysis, the  context of the analysis, and possibly by the availability of data. Longer time horizons, of course,  also mean greater uncertainty as to the results.  * * *  MBA appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on the OCC’s principles and vision for large  bank management of climate-related financial risks. This is an important and emerging area of  risk that warrants attention. We urge the OCC to continue to rely largely on a principles-based  approach to managing this risk, one that leverages existing risk management and supervisory  processes, and that also provides sufficient flexibility both to tailor risk management to the risks  of individual institutions as well as to the evolving state of climate change risk and the evolving  state of the assessment of that risk.

The MBA appreciates the principles-based approach, which aligns with existing risk management frameworks and offers flexibility to tailor risk management to individual institutions and evolving climate risks. The MBA emphasizes the importance of managing climate-related credit risks in mortgage lending, highlighting the potential impact of climate events on credit risk. They support the coordination between FDIC and OCC and suggest that the principles should not create new frameworks but enhance existing ones. The MBA also discusses the importance of scenario analysis, urging the recognition of the exploratory nature of such analyses due to limited data and methodologies. They advocate for a balanced approach, acknowledging the evolving understanding of climate risks, and encourage constructive dialogue and sharing of best practices. The MBA's feedback to the OCC is considered applicable to the FDIC's principles, emphasizing a consistent approach across regulatory bodies."
2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-043,"Risk Management & Regulatory Compliance   BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) practice   TCS - USA    June 3, 2022  RE: Submission in Response to FDIC Request for Comment – ‘‘Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions’’ (RIN 3064– ZA32)  Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a global IT services and consulting organization headquartered in Mumbai, India and  operating in the United States among many countries worldwide. As representatives of TCS’s BFSI Practice specializing  in climate risk management and regulatory compliance, we hereby respond to the FDIC’s Request for Comment on  ‘’Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions’’ published on April 4, 2022.  We welcome FDIC’s renewed focus on climate risk management and concur with the FDIC’s view that sound  management of climate risk exposure by large financial institutions is critical for microprudential security and  macroprudential stability, would protect investors, and will promote efficiency and competition within the financial  system. We likewise share the conviction that climate risk management principles can meaningfully serve “to promote  a consistent understanding of the effective management of climate-related financial risks,” a worthy objective.  Given our expertise and experience in the climate risk management domain, in this response we would like to share  our perspectives on the draft principles, practical challenges faced by banks to comply with the proposed disclosures,  and recommendations for improvement.    Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model, should inform financial  institutions’ adoption of these principles?    Our Viewpoint: Considering the broader impact of climate-related events in adopting these principles, asset size,  location and business model are all important structural drivers of climate-related financial and non-financial risk  exposure. Additionally, financial institutions should consider the predominant sectors and sub-sectors represented by  their investing and lending activities, the tenor of financial instruments offered to customers and clients, the degree  and nature of their exposure to a wide range of financial counterparties, and the transmission channels through which  climate-related financial risks manifest and propagate in traditional financial risk management. Financial institutions  should also consider the breadth and complexity of their organizational structure and financial activities, as climate- related risk exposure is liable to increase while becoming more opaque in larger institutions.  Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its climate-related financial risk  management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations?   Our Viewpoint:  As climate risk is a new risk type for most financial institutions that is cross-cutting in nature across  numerous traditional risk categories, regulatory guidance will help financial institutions to clearly understand  capabilities expected by regulators to manage climate risks and put their best foot forward in planning and developing  those capabilities. 
Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft principles into their risk  management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with financial institutions to understand those challenges?   Our Viewpoint: Climate-related risks typically fit fat-tailed distributions: both physical and transition risks are  characterized by deep uncertainty and nonlinearity, their chances of occurrence are not reflected in past data, and the  possibility of extreme outcomes cannot be ruled out. In this context, traditional approaches to risk management  relying on extrapolation of historical data and on assumptions of normal distributions are inadequate to assess future  climate related risks. These particular characteristics of climate risk factors pose a significant challenge to financial  institutions in developing new types of assessment frameworks and new analytical models for modeling impacts due  to climate change. We recommend FDIC to share industry-level best practices and practical challenges in scenario  analysis and climate risk assessment exercises.  Question 4: Would regulations or guidelines prescribing particular risk management practices be helpful to financial  institutions as they adjust to doing business in a changing climate?   Our Viewpoint: Regulations and guidelines must strike a difficult balance between assuring effectiveness,  comparability, and consistency of practices among regulated institutions while promoting open-mindedness to new  views and practices and flexibility to accommodate approaches tailored to particular circumstances and institutions.  In this nascent and dynamic space of climate risk management, moderately prescriptive guidelines paired with lightly  prescriptive regulations is likely the best approach, to be refined over time based upon feedback from industry  practitioners.  Question 5: What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to successfully incorporate climate-related  financial risks into their risk management frameworks?   Our Viewpoint: From our practical experience with major banks and financial institutions, tools and approaches used  for measuring and monitoring exposure to climate related risks include, among others, exposure analysis and  materiality assessment, heat maps, climate risk dashboards, stress tests, and scenario analysis. These approaches can  be undertaken in a top-down fashion from the institutional or portfolio perspective as well as bottom-up from the  asset or enterprise perspective, and are best pursued in combination. The use of sophisticated data and modeling is  essential for large institutions to rapidly and at scale identify, assess, quantify, and manage risks across large portfolios,  though data quality and granularity and integration of climate modeling and analytics into enterprise risk management  systems requires painstaking and case-specific inspection. Firms should make sure that outputs from these tools  should inform the risk identification process and the management of short- and long-term climate-related financial  risks to an institution’s business model. Financial institutions should also take care to assess the limitations of data and  analytical tools, of the predictive capability of models, recognize inevitable limits in the ability to rigorously and  accurately quantify risk exposure, and consider these limitations in assessing and managing risk exposure.   Question 6: How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant  greater than routine attention by the board and management?   Our Viewpoint: Financial institutions typically conduct a materiality assessment exercise which aims to identify which  climate risk factors & channels are material to their nature and size of business. FDIC could consider including guidance  around materiality assessment, such as what are the key factors to be considered in such assessment and how  effectively outputs should inform institution’s risk appetite planning, policies, and controls.  Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality  of climate-related financial risks?   Our Viewpoint: Many financial institutions consider three different time horizons in climate risk assessment: Short- term, i.e., up to one-year; medium-term, i.e., 1 to 5 years; and long-term, i.e., greater than 5 years. FDIC might consider  issuing non-prescriptive guidelines on appropriate time horizons for climate risk assessment targeted to particular  types of financial institutions, portfolio composition, and risk exposures.   
Question 8: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies—for example, insurance or derivatives contracts  or other capital market instruments—do financial institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related  financial risks?   Our Viewpoint:  Considering that climate-related financial risks are transmitted through traditional risk channels such  as credit risk, liquidity risk, market risk, underwriting risk, and counterparty risk, the risk management and mitigation  mechanisms for managing climate-related risks are typically familiar, such as commodity and currency hedges; futures  contracts, options, and swaps; insurance and guarantees; capital and margin reserves; divestment; etc. Those climate- related risks perhaps most unique to climate change are related to regulation that could potentially lead to asset  stranding or the creation of new liabilities related to carbon pricing, regulatory penalties, and other forms of legal  liability.  Question 9: What, if any, climate-related financial products or services— for example, ‘‘green bonds,’’ derivatives,  dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related considerations into account—do financial  institutions offer to clients and customers?  What risks, if any, do these products or services pose?   Our Viewpoint: Climate-related financial products offered by financial institutions are quite numerous and growing in  number and variety. Inasmuch as these products’ environmental integrity, legal terms, and composition are not always  well understood, they may pose risks similar to those posed by other opaque and complex financial instruments and  assets. Inasmuch as these new products represent novel asset classes, their value may be subject to greater volatility,  particularly if their inherent value is less easily assessed or validated than established assets.  Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation  strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged  communities? Should the agencies modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the  Community Reinvestment Act, to address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other  disadvantaged communities?    Our Viewpoint: We suggest that FDIC should carefully review scenario analysis outputs from various financial  institutions and wider systemic impacts including impacts on disadvantaged communities both in terms of potential  heightened risk exposure as well as capital flight from/capital scarcity in vulnerable and exposed communities.  Stakeholder engagement in disadvantaged and LMI communities will also be an important input to such analysis. These  concerns may require amendments to existing rules and statues and adding special provisions so that impacts to LMI  communities are addressed at the policy level.  Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models from borrowers and other  counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related  financial risks? How do financial institutions currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there  with respect to these data, metrics, tools, or models?   Our Viewpoint: Please see the response to Question 5 above. Sourcing the right data is an important and difficult  challenge in climate risk management; for some core data requirements adequate data may simply be absent. Data  gaps and data quality are pervasive challenges in the climate risk space. Consequently, financial institutions have a  duty to conduct proactive data analysis and identify potential data quality (DQ) issues and employ for climate risk  management the DQ remediation framework used in managing other risks.   Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better capture financial  institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?   Our Viewpoint: We suggest that regulators conduct systemic stress testing to better understand systemic financial  risks due to climate risk factors. Macroprudential stress testing has been undertaken by the U.S. Fed, working with  partners such as the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), as a starting point to improve overall  understanding of impacts of climate risk to the financial system and helps in strengthening existing regulatory 
requirements like incorporating capital requirements for climate risk and assessing the need for new regulatory  regimes. Likewise, microprudential stress testing at the financial institution level is also called for, as has been  instituted as a regulatory requirement by financial regulators in the UK. In general, the SEC’s proposed approach to  mandatory climate risk disclosure by issuers provides valuable guidance for the banking sector.   Question 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions  about plausible future states of the world. How do financial institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools  and what challenges do they face?   Our Viewpoint:  Many financial institutions utilize references climate scenarios suggested by the IPCC, IEA, and NGFS  and use them as such in their stress testing exercises or make minor modifications to incorporate firm-specific  adjustments to those industry reference scenarios. Challenges in climate scenario analysis are multidimensional,  incorporating the following among other difficulties:  1. Sourcing, integrating, and ensuring quality of required data from various sources  2. Selecting a suitable reference period for climate scenario analysis  3. Setting input parameters and assumptions that are aligned with reference scenarios but suitably granular and  disaggregated for application at the financial institution level  4. Conducting sensitivity analysis to changes in input parameters and assumptions  5. Incorporating the impact of potential sudden and acute risk events, reflecting cascading crises and shocks, above  and beyond the ‘smooth’ onset of potential world conditions envisioned in future scenarios  6. Selecting representative potential macroeconomic and physical shocks for scenario analysis and stress testing to  instill confidence in the results of the assessment  7. Complexity in aggregating scenario analysis metrics across different geographic regions and industry segments    Question 14: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and executing scenario analysis  exercises?  Our Viewpoint: Among the factors for the FDIC to consider in scenario analysis are the following:   1) To what degree are the foregoing challenges (mentioned in the response to question 13 above) addressed?  2) What is the right balance of microprudential vs. macroprudential orientation in demanding scenario analysis  from regulated entities and assessing submitted information?   3) To what degree should scenarios be standardized across financial institutions, particularly given variety in  sectoral exposure, geography, financial instruments, institutional complexity, and balance sheet size?  4) What are the resource implications for the regulated entities and is the value of the scenario analysis results  commensurate with the required outlay?  5) To what degree can the FDIC learn, and promote learning within industry among practitioners, from the study  and propagation of methodologies used by the regulated institutions in designing and executing scenario  analysis?   6) To what degree should financial institutions be required to disclose details of such methodologies?

Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions / RIN 3064– ZA32     Dear Acting Chair Gruenberg,    On behalf of Public Citizen, a national public interest advocacy group, and more  than 500,000 members and supporters, we welcome the opportunity to comment  on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) Statement of Principles  for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions  (the Principles). Providing supervisory expectations for financial institutions is a  critical first step to advancing financial institution efforts to assess and address  these risks, and we appreciate the similar OCC and FDIC efforts to date to define  these expectations.    These Principles, similar to the earlier OCC Principles, provide a strong  foundation for protecting large financial institution safety and soundness. They  identify unique characteristics of climate-related risks while also insisting that  financial institutions incorporate climate risk into their existing risk management  plans. Building on the OCC Principles, the FDIC Principles more clearly  acknowledge that climate-related financial risks pose clear and significant risks to  the U.S. financial system and a near-term threat to safe and sound banking and  financial stability.      We appreciate that the Principles recognize how climate risk management  decisions have implications for a financial institution’s broader community  impacts. First, the Principles highlight how a financial institution’s decisions to  manage climate risk by increasing credit costs or decreasing credit availability  have the potential to disparately harm communities of color and low-income  communities. Second, they draw connections between a financial institution’s  publicly stated climate commitments, its internal management strategies, and its  safety and soundness. In both of these areas, financial institutions are already  acting in ways that raise concerns.    
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    2 The Principles could be strengthened, however, by (1) acknowledging and  addressing risks to community banks and savings associations; (2) providing  additional guidance on how financial institutions should account for the unique  aspects of climate-related financial risks, and additional detail on how to  integrate those risks into broader risk management structures; (3) indicating  ways to ensure that financial institutions’ internal strategies align with their  public commitments; and (4) ensuring fair access to financial services.    The Principles should be a first step in a broader regulatory program of  protecting financial institutions and the financial system from climate-related  risks. The Principles should be followed by interagency guidance from all federal  banking regulators detailing and addressing risks posed to community banks,  savings associations, and credit unions. This guidance should also explore  additional ways to make the banking system more resilient to the risks of climate  change, including through developing robust scenarios for scenario analysis at  the insured depository level, and incorporating climate-related risks into risk- weighted capital requirements for large financial institutions. Interagency  guidance should also consider measures to address the financial stability  implications highlighted in the Principles, such as a climate risk capital surcharge  for the largest financial institutions, concentration and portfolio limits for the  riskiest assets, and transition plans to reduce contribution to climate risk via  emissions financing.    To protect both financial institution safety and soundness and the communities  those financial institutions are supposed to serve, we encourage you to quickly  finalize these Principles as guidelines for safety and soundness under 12 U.S.C. §  1831p-1. Once finalized, these guidelines should serve as a basis for the  additional, detailed guidance.    I.  Smaller financial institutions need US regulator attention to  their safety and soundness.     The FDIC is the primary regulator for only a handful of large financial  institutions targeted by these Principles. The FDIC must also ensure the safety  and soundness of approximately 4000 community banks and savings  associations in the US, many of which are critically important for low and  moderate income communities.1 One in five counties exclusively depends on local  financial institutions like these for access to a physical bank branch.     The Principles’ focus on climate risk-related exposures of large financial  institutions—financial institution entities with over $100 billion in total  consolidated assets—only tangentially addresses the immediate and longer-term  threats to the safety and soundness of these smaller financial institutions, and, in  turn, to fair access by marginalized communities to financial services these  smaller institutions provide.      1 FDIC, FDIC Community Banking Study, (December 2020). 
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    3   Climate change is directly, increasingly, repeatedly, simultaneously, and often  permanently impacting homeowners, businesses, and infrastructure within  certain geographies, causing escalating economic and financial losses. As  borrowers and taxpayers struggle or fail to pay their bills, community banks and  savings associations tied to those geographies face heightened safety and  soundness concerns not faced by larger, geographically diversified financial  institutions.  As explained in a report by nonprofit Ceres:    Based on their local expertise, community banks tend to focus on a  few key sectors, such as residential mortgages, commercial real  estate (CRE), small business financing, and agricultural sector  loans. Given this focus, community bank loan portfolios are more  exposed to the physical risks of climate change considering the  vulnerability of these sectors to acute weather events in the near  term and transition risks in the medium to long term.2    The report observes there “are already examples of climate-related disasters that  have fundamentally impacted the safety and soundness of community banks and  credit unions.’’3 Hibernia Bank in Louisiana, for example, experienced $175  million in losses from Hurricane Katrina. A more recent analysis targeting credit  unions reflects the same concerns.4     A 2020 report by the Climate-Related Market Risk Subcommittee of the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC report), describes such repeated  ‘sub-systemic’ shocks as initiating “a systemic crisis in slow motion (emphasis).”5     Threats to the safety and soundness of community banks and savings  associations raise novel challenges for developing effective risk management  measures. Unlike large financial institutions, community banks and savings  associations cannot easily move or significantly shift portfolios; they exist  primarily to serve local community needs. And even where they can, taking such  measures would only further disadvantage the local communities that rely on  them. The FDIC cannot simply ignore these risks.    Nor does it have to. The Principles recognize that part of the FDIC’s mandate is to  consider and address the impact of financial institution activities on the  economy. The FDIC states, “the manner in which financial institutions manage  climate-related financial risks to address safety and soundness concerns should  also seek to reduce or mitigate the impact that management of these risks    2 Id.  3 Ceres, Financing a Net Zero Economy: The Consequences of Physical Climate Risk for Banks,  (Sept. 8, 2021).  4 Ceres, The Changing Climate for Credit Unions, (May 10, 2022).  5 Climate-Related Market Risk Advisory Subcommittee, Managing Risk in the U.S. Financial  System, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Sept. 2020).  
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    4 (emphasis added) may have on broader aspects of the economy.” The FDIC  should consider not only the implications of risk management, but also how  individual institutions are facilitating risks to the broader economy through their  support for greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting activities. When individual  institutions finance GHG emissions, they contribute to the increasing severity of  global warming, fueling the economic damage described above. As small banks  cannot manage climate-related risks without risking severe damage to their  communities, the FDIC should assess how working with all financial institutions  to manage their contribution to climate change can better mitigate those same  risks.    Such an approach is in line with the broader mandate the FDIC has to protect the  stability of the financial system. The Principles acknowledge a relationship  between climate change and financial stability concerns, including the possibility  of contagion from climate-related risks. Indeed, the Principles rightly define  climate-related financial risks as a clear and significant risk to the U.S. financial  system and a near-term threat to safe and sound banking and financial stability.  As discussed above, in the context of climate risk, contagion can occur not only  through a failure of large financial institutions and their links to other financial  entities, but also through the interconnectedness of the environmental and  financial systems and sub-systemic shocks related to this interconnectedness.     When financial institutions finance and facilitate fossil fuel-related activities and  high-emitting projects, they heighten the creation of financial risks and resulting  economic harms caused through connections between the environmental and  financial systems. This is exactly what many large US financial institutions are  doing. The Banking on Climate Chaos report and other studies have  demonstrated that large US financial institutions, through their financing and  facilitating of fossil fuel-related activities and other high-emitting projects,  contribute significantly to GHG emissions and, in turn, exacerbate climate- related risks.6 Similar to financial institution action during the subprime  mortgage crisis, financial institutions supporting fossil fuel-related activities are  creating risks that other entities are left to deal with. The Principles should  recognize that orderly reductions in such financing and support would  meaningfully reduce threats to safety and soundness for all financial institutions  — large and small — as well as the risks of impaired access to financial services  for all communities and risks to the financial system.7 Because few of the  financial institutions that must make these reductions are under the FDIC’s  primary jurisdiction, the FDIC should promote interagency action on these  concerns.

The Principles reinforce that weaknesses in how financial institutions identify,  measure, monitor and control potential climate-related financial risk can  threaten financial institution safety and soundness.8 To assure the safety and  soundness of financial institutions under its jurisdiction,9 the FDIC can prescribe  standards relating to internal controls, loan documentation, credit underwriting,  and other operational and managerial standards, as well as for asset quality.10  Such standards may be prescribed by either regulation or guideline.11 To  appropriately set financial institution expectations and act in accordance with its  mandate, we encourage the FDIC to clarify that it is issuing these principles as a  guideline under 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1.    Overall, the Principles provide an important foundation for appropriately  integrating climate-related financial risk into a large financial institution’s  broader risk management structures. The Principles make clear that financial  institutions must address climate risk management at every level of their  business, from the board level on down. This approach reflects international best  practices, as well as the magnitude of the threat that climate risk poses. The  Principles also appropriately direct financial institutions not to silo climate- related financial risks, but to make them a part of broader internal controls,  including the financial institution’s credit risk appetite and lending limits. This  approach helps make sure that the breadth of potential climate risk impacts is  incorporated into a financial institution’s operations, instead of being siloed in a  separate climate risk function with limited influence on risk taking.    The Principles also start to recognize the ways that climate-related financial risk  differs from the other forms of risk that financial institutions ordinarily seek to  manage. As other regulators have discussed, the effects of climate-related  financial risk will manifest in uncertain ways over a long time horizon.12 The  Principles reflect this by encouraging financial institutions to assess climate risk  over a time horizon that may extend beyond a financial institution’s typical  strategic planning horizon, and by recommending scenario analysis and other  tools for measuring such uncertain exposures.13 Climate-related financial risks  are also highly correlated, in ways that may make traditional hedging and  insurance approaches to risk management ineffective.14 The Principles recognize    8 FDIC, Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk Management for Financial Institutions  (Principles), 1 (April 2022).  9 12 U.S.C. §1.  10 12 U.S.C. §1831p-1.  11 Id.  12 See, e.g., Bank of England Prudential Regulation Authority, “Enhancing banks’ and insurers’  approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change,” Supervisory Statement, (April  2019).  13 Principles at 2  14 New York Department of Financial Services, Guidance for New York Domestic Insurers on  Managing the Financial Risks from Climate Change at 15. 
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    6 this by recommending that management assess potential changes in correlations  across exposures or asset classes, and set credit risk appetite and lending limits in  ways that reflect those potential correlations.15    From this foundation, the Principles can be strengthened by providing more  detailed expectations for how financial institutions address climate change. These  additional expectations fall into two categories: additional guidance for how  financial institutions should account for the unique aspects of climate-related  financial risks, and additional detail on how to integrate those risks into broader  risk management structures.    A. Financial institutions need more guidance on managing the unique  characteristics of climate-related risks.    1. Financial institutions must follow a precautionary approach rather than  relying solely on hedging, insurance, and diversification.    A lesson of the 2008 financial crisis is that even large and sophisticated financial  institutions like Lehman Brothers or Wachovia could not engineer away threats  that were too uncertain, too correlated, or too profitable. Hedging and insurance  are always susceptible to tail risks and unexpected developments. Particularly for  longer-term scenarios where global temperatures exceed 1.5°C, relying on these  solutions may introduce new risks instead of mitigating first-order ones. Climate  change will continue generating new and unpredictable risks that may turn  diversification into correlation. Similar to risks that were originated and  distributed through mortgages and mortgage-backed securities during the 2008  crisis, climate risks originated through financing of fossil assets and distributed  but unaccounted for now could lead to the kind of contagion and financial  instability that the Principles discuss.     A financial institution’s response cannot be to ignore uncertain or unpredictable  risks until they can be appropriately modeled. Rather, the FDIC should  encourage financial institutions to adopt a precautionary approach to climate- related financial risk. This is the approach to general climate risk favored by  experts like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It has also been endorsed as  part of the White House’s climate financial risk roadmap.16 It would be  reasonable for the FDIC to follow the lead of climate scientists and experts who  have concluded that action cannot rely on precise quantification and assessment  of the risks posed by climate change.    A precautionary approach means prioritizing reducing risk even where there is  not full certainty about its magnitude or probability and in the absence of perfect  scientific or economic data. Implementing this approach could mean taking on    15 Principles at 4  16 “A Roadmap to Build a Climate Resilient Economy”, The White House, October 14, 2021 at 17. 
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    7 less risk than what models suggest is acceptable, on the assumption that those  models do not accurately quantify the likelihood or magnitude of all relevant risk  factors, and showing greater sensitivity to high-magnitude risks even when  models suggest they are remote. This latter strategy is particularly apt in the  climate context. Climate models themselves under-forecast harms, largely  because significant aspects of climate change cannot be modeled yet. The science  is being updated constantly, and most updates darken the outlook. One way to  address this challenge is to ‘backtest’ scenario analysis models, similar to use of  backtesting in other contexts.17 Backtesting involves determining the extent to  which a model accurately predicts events that have already occurred, to  understand the extent to which model assumptions are robust. If backtesting a  model reflects a wide gap between expectations and reality, the model is less  likely to predict future scenarios accurately. If scenario analysis models cannot  accurately predict the last few years of climate impacts based on historical data,  then banks cannot use them to conclude that they are adequately accounting for  future climate risks.    When developing risk management procedures, precautionary approaches also  entail not just avoiding unacceptable harms, but also planning for resilience to  inevitable failures. And they counsel financial institutions to assume every part of  the business is subject to climate risk, even in seemingly implausible lines of  business. Global warming is still increasing and, even if it weren’t, scientific  knowledge is still developing.    2. Financial institutions should reduce risks now, even if they are unlikely to  manifest for many years.    A related challenge is the long time horizon under which many climate-related  risks may manifest. As the FDIC recognizes in the Principles, typical financial  institution strategic plans consider the risks and opportunities of the next three  to five years and may not be well suited for identifying or avoiding risks that may  take 30 or 40 years to fully manifest. As the time horizon lengthens, it becomes  more difficult to project how a financial institution’s operations and the broader  economic context will develop.     The FDIC recommends that financial institutions use scenario analysis to better  assess risks outside of the standard time horizons. But improved assessment will  help mitigate risk only if financial institutions embed the findings into their risk  models and management tools today. The uncertain and non-linear nature of  climate harms means that adverse outcomes projected to occur in 20 or 30 years  based on the best current climate science could manifest much sooner, or with  much greater severity. In addition, long duration assets that appear entirely safe  in a three to five year horizon may become extremely risky over two or three    17 Marie-Noëlle Woillez, Economic impacts of a glacial period: a thought experiment to assess the  disconnect between econometrics and climate sciences, (2020).   
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    8 decades. Finally, financial institution assets can become path dependent, as even  short-duration assets are typically refreshed with substantially similar ones. A  failure to start reducing foreseeable risks now means that necessary future  readjustments may be far sharper and more disruptive to a financial institution’s  business and to its customers. To better manage these risks, financial institutions  should be taking steps now to mitigate risks that they believe will not manifest for  years instead of assuming that they can mitigate those risks in the future.      B. Financial institutions should better integrate climate-related financial risk  into existing structures    1. The FDIC should add standards for assessing asset quality to its guidance.    The FDIC’s mandate to prescribe standards for safety and soundness includes  standards relating to asset quality.18 The FSOC’s Report on Climate-Related  Financial Risk repeatedly highlights the way that both the physical harms of  climate change and the ongoing transition toward clean energy and away from  greenhouse gas emissions may lead to sharp changes in the values of certain  assets.19 Because of this risk, financial institutions will need to incorporate  climate-related risks into their assessment of numerous affected asset classes.     The Principles should provide some initial expectations for how financial  institutions will undertake such assessments. This would be in keeping with  standard practice, as the FDIC provides guidance on assessing asset quality as  part of a safety and soundness exam. Along with the overall guidance in its Risk  Management Manual, the FDIC has issued Financial Institution Letters (FILs),  on asset classes that are subject to both physical and transition risks, including  for example an FIL on Prudent Risk Management of Oil and Gas Exposures and  an FIL on Prudent Management of Agricultural Lending During Economic  Cycles.    The FDIC should immediately highlight that these and other asset classes are  susceptible to climate-related risk and that climate risk is another vector for  cross-asset class risks. As an example, reserve-based lending to oil and gas  exploration companies is based on assumptions about the value of proven  producing reserves, subject to semi-annual borrowing base redeterminations.  The FDIC should explicitly state that financial institutions need to take transition  risk into account in valuing those reserves and in making assumptions about how  quickly the value of a producer’s borrowing base may decline. It should  recommend that financial institutions incorporate similar climate considerations  into their asset quality assessments across the board. The FDIC should also  announce its intention to revise FILs to reflect the specific approaches needed to  manage climate-related risk.     18 12 USC §1831p-1.  19 Financial Stability Oversight Council, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, 2021.

The Principles direct financial institutions to consider climate-related financial  risks as part of their underwriting and monitoring of portfolios.20 For financial  institutions to do this effectively, they must require useful climate-related risk  information from potential clients and have the capacity to assess that  information’s veracity and completeness. At a minimum, the information  financial institutions need should include information compliant with the Task  Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures recommendations, including a  company’s metrics, targets, and transition plans.21 For instance, for underwriting  credit, financial institutions should review the direct and indirect emissions  attributable to a company at present, as well as projections of how an extension  of credit would affect those emissions. This will help a financial institution assess  the transition risk it assumes from extending credit. Financial institutions should  also ask for a company’s own transition plans and understand how it is preparing  for a coming net zero transition. That will help the financial institution better  understand a potential client’s vulnerability to transition risk.    Financial institutions may find it difficult to obtain such information from some  clients and resist such a process. But a company’s failure to generate this  information is itself a red flag about its ability to effectively manage climate risk,  and should raise concerns about the safety and soundness of a loan. If financial  institutions feel that the current state of available information is insufficient to  appropriately assess climate-related risk, then they should work with the  Securities and Exchange Commission to develop and adopt disclosure and audit  rules that standardize and improve the transparency of such information for  reporting companies, as well as to broaden the scope of companies that must  report such information.    To help it assess how effectively financial institutions are managing these risks,  the FDIC should also work with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council (FFIEC) to require disclosure of relevant climate risk-related information  in the Reports of Condition and Income, colloquially known as “call reports,” that  financial institutions periodically file. Call reports today capture certain climate- related risk data, such as agricultural, automobile, and real estate assets, but they  do not provide details on the geographic distribution of loans or exposure to the  fossil fuel industry. The report should add a series of line items to each applicable  schedule about loans for fossil fuel exploration, production and fossil electricity  generation, as well as securities backed by these assets and derivatives  referencing them. As with real estate lending on the current call report, these  loans should be broken out by duration, with detailed information about    20 Principles at 4.  21 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, Guidance on Metrics, Targets, and  Transition Plans, 2021.

The call reports should also add additional  information about exposure of existing loan types to physical risks, such as  separate line items for loans and asset-backed securities secured by real estate in  flood zones or high wildfire risk areas.    It should not be any additional burden on financial institutions to disclose this  information, even if it does not align precisely with other reporting frameworks,  such as the one proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Information about financial institution exposures to high-risk assets should  already be part of management information systems and risk monitoring reports.  If financial institutions struggle to gather this information, then the FDIC should  be deeply concerned. It is likely that these financial institutions will also struggle  to monitor and mitigate risks properly.    III. To be aligned with common types of public climate  commitments, financial institutions’ internal management  strategies must follow climate science.     We applaud the Principles for addressing financial institutions’ climate  commitments. As we observe earlier, while the FDIC regulates only a small  number of institutions that have made commitments to “net-zero” emissions, the  FDIC has a strong interest in working with the OCC and the Fed to ensure that all  banks making such commitments align their strategies to climate science.      A number of watchdog groups have raised questions about the sincerity of bank  commitments to net zero, pointing out that financial institutions with insured  depositories are large fossil fuel funders.22 This disconnect should raise serious  concerns for financial institution regulators. It suggests that public management  statements about a financial institution’s strategic direction are not reflected in  its operational decision-making and internal controls. If the failure occurs in such  a public, high stakes arena, it should create doubts about how effectively  management can transmit other strategic direction and risk management  initiatives throughout the business. Such doubts indicate serious risks to a  financial institution’s safety and soundness.    The Principles’ direction that financial institutions must align their internal  management strategies and public climate commitments demonstrates the  FDIC’s understanding of this connection. Along with positive reputational  benefits, transitioning from financed emissions is a way to manage climate risk.23  Where financial institutions cannot or do not bring their internal practices in line  with their commitments, that failure should serve as an early warning sign that  the financial institution may not be able to implement other climate risk  management imperatives into its operations. Like climate risk management,    22 Rainforest Action Network et al., Banking on Climate Chaos: Fossil Fuel Finance Report 2021.  23 NYDFS Guidance, supra note 10. 
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    11 climate commitments are a developing field. Although a number of standard  setters like the Net Zero Banking Alliance are working to align criteria across  financial institutions, there is still no single definition or standard for what a  commitment means. To help financial institutions understand how banking  regulators will evaluate the alignment of their public commitments and internal  management strategies, the FDIC should work with the OCC and the Federal  Reserve to quickly follow these Principles with additional guidance on this topic.  Among the most significant questions this guidance should address are (1)  reliance on offsets; (2) limits on new fossil fuel development and phasing out of  fossil fuels; and (3) measurable near-term targets.    1. Financial institutions should not rely on offsets to achieve their net zero  commitments.    Some financial institution climate commitments rely, either implicitly or  explicitly, on financing reductions of carbon in the atmosphere in addition to  reducing the level of emissions financed by the financial institution.24 As  implemented, these reductions are intended to cancel out existing emissions  instead of ending them. This is the “net” in net zero commitments. Such  approaches are referred to as offsets.    Significant concerns exist about the efficacy of relying on nature-based offsets,  such as forests and wetlands, as sinks of greenhouse gasses. These include the  exaggeration of the level of additional carbon emissions actually avoided for  preservation of existing forests, the limits on the level of emissions that can  reasonably be sequestered via the creation of new natural carbon sinks, and the  challenges of protecting natural sinks from human and natural impacts in ways  that keep the emissions from being returned to the atmosphere at a later date.    ● Exaggeration of additional emissions reductions: Many carbon offset  deals pay for the manager of a forest to continue what they are already  doing, creating a challenge for assessing the “additionality” of an offset.  For instance, in 2019, the Albany Water Board sold carbon credits  generated by “preserving” forestland in the city’s watersheds.25 It  calculated the purported level of avoided emissions by using as a baseline  the amount of carbon that would be emitted if the land were industrially  managed. But the Albany Water Board does not harvest timber, and had  not previously indicated any intention of selling the land. Any emissions  avoided as a result of this deal were purely hypothetical. At best, the  carbon credits had no impact on emissions; at worst, they were used to  justify increased emissions. Such baseline accounting is typical of large    24 Anne Finucane, “Carbon Offsets Can Help in the Transition to Net Zero,” Bank of America  Newsroom (Jun. 8, 2021).  25 Dr. Charles D. Canham, “Rethinking forest carbon offsets,” Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies,  (May 19, 2021). 
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    12 dealers in carbon offsets and acceptable to many offset standard setters.26  Financial institutions relying on this kind of offset are performing an  accounting trick, not reducing carbon emissions. These offsets should not  be permitted, and a financial institution’s attempt to rely on them should  raise questions regarding management’s competence to meet any of its  commitments or, alternatively, its willingness to use other accounting  tricks to create the appearance of meeting them.  ● Limits on sequestration: Another approach to carbon offsets is  afforestation or, more plainly, planting trees. This superficially appealing  idea rapidly runs into challenges of scale. As of 2021, global climate  pledges already set a near term goal of using afforestation to sequester 2  gigatons of CO2 emissions annually.27 Meeting those commitments would  require ecosystem restoration of 678 million hectares—twice the land area  of the country of India.28 That level of afforestation is not plausible for one  year, much less annually, and attempts to pursue it on that scale would  likely trigger negative consequences for Indigenous peoples and local  communities residing on the land targeted for afforestation. Reliance on  afforestation for offsets at any scale is simply implausible, and should raise  questions about management’s ability to assess the feasibility of a project.   ● Protecting carbon sinks: Even assuming that some nature-based projects  actually sequester carbon emissions relative to a reasonable baseline, there  is still a challenge of maintaining them over time. Unfortunately, the  increasing physical impacts of climate change create a new set of hazards.  The increasing frequency of wildfires in 2020 and 2021 has burned a  number of projects designed to sequester carbon in Oregon.29  Some offset  projects have “buffer pools” of unused emissions, but the growing  frequency of wildfires will only increase the risk that those pools will be  exceeded, rendering their contribution to a net zero pledge null.     In addition to these nature-based offsets, there are efforts to develop or deploy  carbon removal technologies, such as carbon capture, utilization and storage  (CCUS), and direct air capture (DAC). Both technologies are largely unproven  with existing demonstration projects exhibiting challenges. For instance, a  hydrogen plant that Shell touted as using a carbon capture system actually  emitted 50% more greenhouse gasses than it sequestered during the period of its    26 Ben Elgin, “JPMorgan, Disney, Blackrock Buy Nature Conservancy's Useless Carbon Offsets,”  Bloomberg, (Dec 9, 2020).  27 Doreen Stabinsky, Chasing Carbon Unicorns: The Deception of Carbon Markets and Net Zero,  Friends of the Earth International (Feb. 2021).  28 Id.  29 Debra Kahn, Wildfires rage and a tool to combat climate change goes up in smoke, POLITICO  (July 27, 2021). 
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    13 operation.30 Meanwhile, the cost to capture carbon dioxide at the world’s largest  direct air capture plant is four to eight times higher than what is needed to turn a  profit.31 The plant’s operator does not expect direct air capture to be cost  competitive until the late 2030s at the earliest. Assuming for the sake of  argument that this projection is accurate, the technology will be far too late to  play a significant role in meeting science-based emissions targets. Given these  challenges, financial institutions relying on these technologies in their net zero  plans should have to demonstrate specific, committed projects that are fully  proven to reduce carbon safely and permanently at scale, and appropriately  incorporate the cost of both funding and adequately monitoring those  commitments into their profitability forecasts. No projects currently meet these  criteria, and there may be none for decades, if ever. Given the current state of  development, reliance on this technology to generate meaningful emissions  reductions as part of a net-zero commitment should be viewed with extreme  skepticism.    As a result of these concerns, and the current scarcity of offsets that meet quality  standards, offsets are becoming increasingly disfavored among those seeking to  reduce emissions in the financial sector and beyond. Global Financial Alliance for  Net Zero (GFANZ) Chair Mark Carney has indicated that use of such “carbon  offsets” should be a “last resort” to cover residual emissions that remain at the  conclusion of an extensive process to reduce absolute emissions to zero.  Similarly, the European Commission and Parliament provisionally agreed on the  need to prioritize emissions reductions over emissions removals. The clear global  standard is that claims of alignment with science-based targets should be based  almost entirely on reducing financed emissions. The OCC, FDIC and the Fed  should provide guidance on how it will assess the emissions removal component  of climate commitments that reflects the challenges in employing them.    2. Any science-based climate commitment must include a bar on financing  new fossil fuel projects.    The International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions Scenario and related  Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector say that, to limit global temperature rise  to 1.5°C and meet Paris Agreement goals, new fossil fuel development cannot be  permitted. But, as discussed above, U.S. financial institutions are the most  significant financiers of fossil fuels globally and have continued to fund both new  and existing development despite voicing their support for the Paris Agreement.  Financial institutions are not aligning their management plans with their climate  commitments, and cannot do so as long as they do not exclude fossil fuel  expansion from their business. The FDIC should work with the OCC and the Fed  to explain how it will assess the alignment of continued support for fossil fuel  expansion and other high emissions sectors, with net-zero climate commitments.       30 Global Witness, Hydrogen’s Hidden Emissions (Jan 20, 2022).  31 Id. 
  215 Pennsylvania Ave. SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 • (202) 588-1000 • www.citizen.org    14 3. Climate commitments must include short and medium-term targets.    Most financial institutions’ climate commitments promise net-zero financed  emissions by 2050. Few, however, give any intermediate timelines or metrics for  how they will achieve them. Given the transition risk faced by high-emissions  assets, this is not a safe and sound practice. Financial institutions that expect to  do the bulk of their emissions reductions in the late 2030s and 2040s may find a  limited market for those assets, especially if other financial institutions have the  same idea. Such a situation could require write downs of asset values that would  threaten a financial institution’s solvency. Measurable, near-term, sector-specific  targets for absolute financed emissions are centrally important to monitoring  whether a financial institution has a credible plan to meet its climate  commitments and is executing the plan effectively. The FDIC should provide  guidance on what a safe and sound emissions reduction pathway looks like, and  the specific milestones that will help examiners assess whether a financial  institution can credibly align its business with climate commitments in a safe and  sound fashion.    IV. The FDIC should work with the OCC and the Fed to issue  additional guidelines to protect vulnerable communities from the  disparate impact of climate-related risk management.    The guidance also addresses two key ways climate risk threatens fair access to  financial services. The first threat to fair access, as described above, is through  impacts to the safety and soundness of local financial institutions. As indicated  above, the vast majority of financial institutions in the US are local financial  institutions. They are more vulnerable to climate risk than larger financial  institutions due to the financial needs they meet, but are also critically important  for rural communities and marginalized communities. Along with addressing the  threats that the climate crisis poses to individual financial institution safety and  soundness for all financial institutions, the FDIC, in collaboration with the OCC  and the Fed, could also focus on limiting financial institution mergers and  strengthening the Community Reinvestment Act (rules) as tools for extending  credit in underserved areas. The recent proposal to revise CRA rules is a good  vehicle to implement such changes.32     The second threat to access is through measures taken by financial institutions to  reduce their own exposures to climate-related credit and other financial risks. As  the impacts of climate change become more severe, they exacerbate long- standing issues of environmental racism. Environmental racism is when  communities of color suffer disproportionate exposure to toxins and other  environmental threats.33 It is the product of choices over decades by governments    32 Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  Community Reinvestment Act, Joint Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Request for Comment (June 3 2022).   33 Michela Zonta and Zoe Willingham, A CRA To Meet the Challenge of Climate Change:  Advancing the Fight Against Environmental Racism, Center for American Progress, (December

For similar reasons, climate  change will disproportionately hurt communities of color and low-income  communities. For instance, communities of color comprise a majority of the two  million Americans who reside within a mile of locations vulnerable to increasing  flooding.34 Due to decades of disinvestments and the resulting low tax base, these  communities lack the drainage and sewer infrastructure necessary to withstand  more frequent flooding—and also lack the resources to build it. Other effects of  outdated housing and infrastructure will also expose already vulnerable  communities disproportionately to increasing severity and frequency of extreme  weather and heat.35     As financial institutions recognize the negative impacts of the climate crisis on  their business, these structural disadvantages are increasingly reflected in the  practice of “bluelining,”36 or identifying areas as at higher environmental risk and  raising costs or avoiding underwriting in those areas. A financial institution’s  seemingly risk-based analysis will follow the same or similar boundaries as those  established by previous redlining decisions that have created and perpetuated  racial and economic inequality in the United States. This bluelining itself will  further entrench inequality and racial disparities. Areas free of the negative  effects of bluelining can use their existing tax base to invest in climate adaptation,  which will allow them to retain access to credit, while the loss of insurance in  bluelined areas will lower property values, degrade the tax base, and make it  harder for those communities to invest in necessary adaptation.    Potentially harmful financial institution measures are likely to include closing  branches in ‘hot-spot’ areas, increasing costs related to financing in these areas or  limiting the availability of credit, and pursuing other measures that could reduce  access to services. Such concerns may be particularly exacerbated in certain lines  of business, like mortgage lending, if insurer withdrawals occur at the same  time.37     The proposed guidance recognizes this threat, indicating, as part of its  “Management of Risk Areas” principle, that financial institution boards and  management should consider how risk mitigation measures disproportionately  impact communities on the basis of race, ethnicity, or another prohibited basis.    While the guidance’s attention to disproportionate impacts is welcome, financial  institutions may find that it pushes them in multiple directions.

The FDIC should move  quickly to issue additional guidance on how financial institutions can continue to  extend credit to vulnerable communities while acting in a safe and sound  manner. For instance, the FDIC could encourage financial institutions to reduce  risk elsewhere, such as lending that is particularly vulnerable to transition risk,  while preserving access to credit for low- and middle-income communities. This  approach will allow a financial institution to manage risk and bolster its  resilience without unduly restricting credit for marginalized communities.    This guidance should be particularly attentive to the needs of smaller financial  institutions, who may feel that climate risk management would render large  swathes of their business unsafe. The FDIC’s expanded guidance on fair access  should reinforce the important role that these local and community financial  institutions can serve in expanding access to credit. It should explicitly tell these  financial institutions how they can incorporate climate risk data into their  existing local knowledge without drawing concerns about unsafe and unsound  practices. And it should make it clear that examiners will assess the risk  associated with lending in support of climate resilience and adaptation for  underserved communities with more leniency, as long as it follows well-designed  policies and procedures.    To help small financial institutions further, the FDIC should look for ways to  offer standardized climate data and modeling tools to these financial institutions.  With a growing attention to climate risk, providers are raising prices or  increasingly being absorbed by large financial institutions.38 The FDIC, in  conjunction with the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, could help provide  needed data and modeling to financial institutions that lack the resources to  develop or purchase it, helping keep them safe.    V. The FDIC should continue seeking alignment with other  jurisdictions.    The Principles state that the FDIC aims to consider best practices from other  jurisdictions that are advancing efforts and measures that might have  significance for the US. We encourage the FDIC to use these efforts as a guidepost  on where to go from here. Such efforts include, for example, plans by the  European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission to require financial  institutions to develop “Paris-compatible transition plans” that will “steer their  business towards a smooth transition to carbon neutrality.”39 UN Secretary- General Antonio Guterres is establishing an expert panel “to propose clear  standards to measure and analyze net-zero commitments from non-state actors,”    38 Andrew Freedman, Why big financial firms are scooping up climate modeling companies, Axios  (Jan. 7, 2022).  39 Frank Elderson, “Overcoming the Tragedy of the Horizon: requiring banks to translate 2050  targets into milestones,” Financial Markets Authority’s Supervisory Conference, (Oct. 20, 2021).

But they can  have this effect only if they are quickly finalized as guidelines, and used as a  departure point for issuing more detailed, tailored guidance applicable to all of  the financial institutions under the FDIC’s jurisdiction.

Gruenberg Acting Chair, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 550 17th St. NW Washington, DC 20429 June 3, 2022 Re: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions Dear Acting Chair Gruenberg, On behalf of the 67 undersigned organizations and our millions of members and supporters, we welcome the opportunity to comment on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions. We support this important step toward advancing financial institutions’ efforts to assess and address climate-related risk, and we urge the FDIC to strengthen and finalize the draft as soon as possible. Climate change poses significant risks to the safety and soundness of financial institutions, the financial system, and communities. We support the FDIC’s recommendations for large financial institutions to take a whole-of-business approach to mitigating climate risk, to consider longer time horizons for assessing and addressing climate risk, and to develop climate-related data and scenario analysis modeling. We also welcome the provisions directing these financial institutions to align their internal strategies with their public climate commitments and to recognize the fair lending implications of their risk-management measures and their adverse effects on low-income and other disadvantaged households and communities. Nevertheless, we are concerned that the Statement does not directly acknowledge that: (1) nearly all of the financial institutions regulated by the FDIC are community banks and savings associations — financial institutions disproportionately threatened by climate change; and (2) large US financial institutions not only face significant climate-related risks, but also fuel the risks through their financing of greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting activities. The Statement should acknowledge these realities and explicitly recognize that large financial institutions — through their financing and facilitating of emissions — are threatening the safety and soundness of other important FDIC-regulated financial entities, as well as the financial system. This acknowledgment will lay the groundwork for the FDIC to cooperate with other federal banking regulators to protect the safety and soundness of the banking system.
We also urge the FDIC to provide greater clarity around what it means for large financial institutions to align their climate commitments to their internal strategies, and to provide even greater attention to fair lending concerns fueled by climate risk management. Acknowledging the need for large financial institutions to stop enabling climate change The FDIC is mandated to ensure the safety and soundness of approximately 4,000 community banks and savings associations in the US, many of which are critically important for low and moderate income communities. One in five counties depends on community banks for access to a physical bank branch. And, yet, the Statement targets climate risks to only large financial institutions - of which the FDIC regulates only a handful. This focus draws inadequate attention to the fact that community banks and savings associations are particularly vulnerable to climate change-related impacts. One federal advisory committee explained that this vulnerability is due to community banks’ focus on agriculture, residential, and commercial real estate lending, and their reduced capacity to move or shift portfolios. This committee observed that climate-related sub-systemic shocks to communities and, in turn, to community banks, are creating a systemic crisis in slow motion. The FDIC is understandably seeking to tailor expectations for small banks to reflect their circumstances. But this Statement is an opportunity to acknowledge the fact that protecting small banks and the deposit fund requires addressing the risks that large banks are facilitating. The Statement acknowledges that climate-related financial risks can be transmitted to a significant number of financial institutions and raise financial stability concerns. Indeed, the Statement rightly defines climate-related financial risks as a clear and significant risk to the U.S. financial system and a near-term threat to safe and sound banking and financial stability. When banks finance the creation of heightened climate-related risks, they contribute to this threat. This is exactly what the largest US banks are doing. The Banking on Climate Chaos report and other studies have demonstrated that large US banks, through their financing and facilitating of fossil fuel-related activities and other high-emitting projects, contribute significantly to GHG emissions and, in turn, exacerbate climate-related risks. Similar to bank action during the subprime mortgage crisis, banks supporting fossil fuel-related activities are creating risks that other entities are left to deal with. The Statement should recognize that orderly reductions in such financing and support would meaningfully reduce safety and soundness risks for all financial institutions — large and small — as well as the risks of impaired access to financial services for all communities and risks to the financial system. Because few of the banks that must make these reductions are under the FDIC’s primary jurisdiction, the Statement should be
followed by an interagency guidance from all federal banking regulators detailing the risks that financed emissions create, and how to reduce those risks. Ensuring transparency and alignment of climate commitments and strategies We welcome the provision directing financial institutions to ensure that their internal strategies are consistent with their public statements, given that many large US financial institutions - including FDIC-regulated Truist bank - have publicly committed to creating and executing “net-zero” transition plans. However, to ensure that this provision contributes to meaningful climate-related risk management, greater detail is necessary. To date, many US banks that have made commitments to “net-zero” emissions by 2050, including members of the bank-led Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) initiative under the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), are falling short of establishing strategies to meet these commitments, and are still engaging in actions inconsistent with them. Financial institutions are continuing to finance new fossil fuel activities, other high-emitting projects, and companies expanding high-emitting activities. This financing is not compatible with reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 or limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. This conduct raises questions about whether financial institution managers desire to follow through on these commitments or are merely seeking public relations wins. To meet its public commitments, a financial institution’s corresponding actions and internal strategies must be grounded in climate science and technological realities. The FDIC should clarify what it means in practice for large financial institutions to align their net-zero transition plan commitments with their internal strategies. Among the most significant parameters to expand on are (1) providing measurable near-term targets based firmly in climate science and technological realities; (2) aligning financial institution financing with the institution’s own commitments to net-zero emissions; and (3) accurately accounting for the challenges posed by offsets. Measurable Targets The FDIC should make clear that financial institutions committing to net zero by 2050 must have in place, and must implement, credible internal strategies that meet the imperatives of climate science, technological realities, and safety and soundness. A credible plan in line with public commitments includes short- and medium-term targets and metrics. Such milestones are
critical not just to meeting the commitments, but also to avoiding a fire sale from financial institutions trying to meet their commitments at the last minute. A credible plan should include milestones such as a 50% reduction in absolute financed emissions by 2030 and should be publicly available. Aligning Financing Activity to Emissions Reductions Targets The expansion of fossil fuel production is not compatible with any science-based limit on global temperature rise or with meeting public commitments for net-zero financed emissions by 2050. Key tenets of the International Energy Agency’s roadmap for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 include “no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects” and “no further final investment decisions for new unabated coal plants.” Yet, as indicated by the recent Banking on Climate Chaos report, U.S. financial institutions are the most significant financiers of fossil fuels globally, and have continued to increase their funding despite voicing their support for the Paris Agreement and committing to net zero by 2050. Such contradictions raise serious questions about the sincerity of financial institutions’ climate commitments or, alternatively, the soundness of their management processes and controls. To meaningfully align their internal strategies and their commitments, financial institutions need to switch to a science-based approach to meeting absolute emissions reduction targets. We urge the FDIC to work with all regulators to adopt a consistent approach to overseeing alignment of climate commitments in line with these recommendations. . Offsets Some institutions may seek to rely heavily on purported “offsets” of carbon emissions from forests, wetlands, and carbon removal technologies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. But offsets have such deep limitations that they cannot be relied on to play more than a trivial role in any credible net-zero plan. The limitations include difficulties quantifying or verifying avoided or reduced emissions, questions about the effectiveness and permanence of natural sinks that may be threatened by human or natural impacts, concerns about the reliability and legal norm compliance of promised reductions due to violations of Indigenous rights and treaties, the lack of technologies that are credible and dependable, and the potential for fraud. For these reasons, climate commitment standard setters are increasingly treating offsets as only a last resort to negate residual emissions that remain after financial institutions have directly reduced financed emissions as near to zero as is possible.
Questions about the integrity of offsets have stymied efforts by Mark Carney and others to advance the carbon offset market, and also prompted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to begin examining the integrity of offsets-related claims. Given these challenges, regulators should understand how banks are assessing offsets as part of their climate commitments, and carefully scrutinize plans that rely on offsets for reductions of more than a residual level of emissions. Ensuring fair access to financial services We welcome the FDIC’s attention to potential fair lending concerns as financial institutions reduce their own exposures to climate change-related credit and other financial risks. Financial institutions are increasingly likely, for example, to reduce financing  in “hot-spot” areas and for assets threatened by climate-related extreme weather events — following the lead of insurers who are restricting or raising the price of coverage in hotspot areas. Costs related to financing in these areas are likely to increase, which will slow these communities’ ability to recover and adapt, further entrenching climate-exacerbated racial and economic inequalities. The FDIC’s recent proposal to revise Community Reinvestment Act rules recognizes several of these challenges. The FDIC correctly calls on financial institutions to reduce or mitigate the impact that risk management may have on broader aspects of the economy, including disproportionate impact on disadvantaged communities. It should move quickly to issue additional guidance on how financial institutions can improve on providing credit to vulnerable communities equitably while acting in a safe and sound manner. As part of this guidance, the agency should call on  financial institutions to identify, measure, monitor, and address potential and actual disproportionate impacts on marginalized  communities, such as communities of color and low-moderate-income communities, and have a system for tracking the progress of their actions to avoid or address disproportionate impacts. It should also reiterate that banks cannot exacerbate climate-related financial risks with their willingness to finance high emissions activities, and then pull back from the communities harmed by the climate impacts their financing has fueled. Such conduct cannot be a path to prudently meeting the financial services needs of their communities. Conclusion These draft principles are an important step in the right direction. They are also only a starting point that should be followed by additional guidance. The U.S. lags behind much of the world on mitigating climate-related risk. We encourage the FDIC to take the lead with its global peers
at the European Central Bank (ECB), Canada’s Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and other regulators who are actively exploring the need for additional supervisory measures to respond to climate risk, including the need for increased attention to capital and liquidity requirements at the largest, most complex institutions. We look forward to continuing to engage with you on these issues. For questions, please contact Anne Perrault at aperrault@citizen.org and Yevgeny Shrago at yshrago@citizen.org.

It highlights climate change as a significant risk to financial institutions and communities, advocating for a comprehensive approach to risk mitigation, longer assessment horizons, and alignment of internal strategies with public climate commitments. Concerns are raised about the draft's lack of focus on community banks, which are vulnerable to climate impacts, and the role of large banks in financing greenhouse gas-emitting activities. The comment calls for greater clarity on aligning climate commitments with internal strategies, emphasizing measurable targets, reduced reliance on offsets, and fair lending practices. It urges the FDIC to collaborate with other regulators to address financed emissions and ensure equitable access to financial services, particularly for disadvantaged communities.

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention: Comments RIN 3064-ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429  RE: RIN 3064-ZA32 ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions""  Dear Mr. Sheesley:  This letter is written to respond to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) Request  for Comment titled, RIN 3064-ZA32, ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Financial Institutions"" in the Federal Register. We offer these comments with the best  intentions for the U. S. economy, the banking community, the small and large businesses and  consumers in our local, regional and nationwide markets.  Bryant Bank is a $2.5 billion community bank headquartered in Tuscaloosa, Alabama with 18  locations in the State of Alabama. We are very proud of the service provided to our customers  and the communities we serve throughout the State of Alabama. We also provide correspondent  banking services with the focus to serve the communities of Alabama where we do not have  locations by serving the community banks in the State of Alabama with correspondent banking  services.  The draft Principles are presented for financial institutions larger than $100 billion in assets.  However, the reality is that these draft Principles could defacto become the expectation of all  financial institutions once implemented. This is intimated with the comment in the Federal Register  filing on Page 19509, Column 1 first paragraph, ""Climate-related financial risks pose a clear  and significant risk to the U. S. financial system and, if unmitigated, may pose a near-term  threat to safe and sound banking and financial stability."" In our opinion, this appears to be a  statement of fact regarding all institutions rather than the financial institutions greater than $100  billion in assets. Also, the statement does not take into account the current regulations, risk  monitoring processes or systems that are in place that assess risk to the financial institutions  portfolio's or balance sheet management.  The Principles do not take into account existing monitoring processes in place at financial  institutions of all sizes. Those risks may not be consolidated in a report that a regulator, auditor  or political special interest can obtain in the analysis, however financial institutions are in the  business of assessing risk and pricing it appropriately along with assisting their potential customer  and existing customer with whether the financial institution would be able to have exposure to a  1  Unbeatable Service.

certain type of risk. Additionally, the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology (CECL) model  that is already in place for the larger institutions, are to assess risk and to account for the risk in  their portfolio in relation to expected losses in the future for a given asset. Not all Institutions below  the size of the Federal Register's focus have adopted CECL at this point but that regulatory  burden is quickly approaching for all size institutions beginning in January 2023 (takes effect in  fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022).  We are of the opinion a separate risk-management framework for climate-related financial risk is  unnecessary to manage the safety and soundness at our bank or any community bank with fewer  than $100 billion in assets. We are also concerned about being able to obtain information to the  detail needed from our borrowers to meet documentation of climate impact on their products or  services provided. This will increase costs as well as potentially eliminate commerce with existing  customers and businesses.  Community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system and should not be subject to  one size fits all climate related regulation. Our bank manages risks to the bank's portfolio's from  an overall risk as well as a transactional risk view for a given opportunity. We as community  bankers are always thinking of how the bank could be affected by a particular credit exposure as  well as are we serving our customer appropriately in making the given loan. Some of the reporting  would require resources that are not currently available within a community bank. This will result  in cost, time, as well as potentially additional staff to meet the Principles listed in the Federal  Register. Again, while this is written to be for financial institutions of $100 billion in assets or  greater, more than one time in the filing, all financial institutions are referred to. For example,  Page 19509, middle column, first paragraph, ""Some financial institutions, including many  large financial institutions, are considering climate-related risks and would benefit from  additional guidance as they develop capabilities, deploy resources, and make necessary  investments to address climate related financial risks."" (Next Paragraph), ""Although all  financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material exposures to climate-related financial  risks, these draft principles are targeted at the largest financial institutions with over $100 billion  in total consolidated assets."" The next sentence is, ""The draft principles are an initial step to  promote a consistent understanding of the effective management of climate-related financial risks.  The draft principles goes on to indicate the FDIC intends to appropriately tailor any resulting  supervisory expectations to reflect differences in institutions' circumstances such as complexity  of operations and business models.  We are concerned that these Principles would affect the expected actions of community banks  as ""Best Practices"" or in future ""rulings"", ""guidance"" or ""requirements"" that would impose  regulatory burden, costs and push an increased amount of mergers in the community bank space  that has other impacts on communities that need locally owned bank service and knowledge of  their particular market to meet the needs of that community. We saw the advantages of the local  community banks during the pandemic. We need to make sure we preserve the community  banking model as we impose and implement new regulatory principles, rules and actions for the  betterment of the U. S. economy short and long term. The existing risk management practices  have been effective and have enabled community banks to manage climate-related risk for  decades. Some industries that are now deemed as having more climate related impact have been  customers of banks for decades. Those risks have been managed throughout that timeframe.  2 
On April 27, 2011, the State of Alabama experienced a horrific and deadly day of tornadoes  impacting most of our state. Specifically, the Tuscaloosa area was hit with an EF-4 tornado that  resulted in 65 deaths and over 1,500 injuries in our city. The same EF-4 impacted the northern  area of the City of Birmingham with similar destruction of homes, business, injuries and deaths.  We serve both of those markets, Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. Overall, there were 62 tornadoes  that touched down in the State of Alabama resulting in 240 deaths and approximately 3,000  injuries. During the event and in the clean-up process as well as the recovery process, we served  our customers as did our brethren community bankers and large bankers to ensure access to  financial services were available to the communities affected. Tornadoes, hurricanes, natural  disasters such as hazardous waste spills and other threats are impacts that financial institutions  exercise and plan to be as prepared as possible to ensure services are available to the consumers  and corporate customers at time of event. There are always lessons learned in any event or  experience that make everyone better prepared for the next unforeseen issue which was seen in  2020 with the pandemic. Community bankers served with the highest impact during the pandemic  to provide PPP loans to customers needing the money to maintain their businesses and their  communities. We were proud to be a community bank serving during customer's needs during  the pandemic.  In the State of Alabama, we have a public/private partnership with the State EMA, State and  Federal Regulators and the Alabama Bankers Association named the Alabama Recovery  Coalition for the Financial Sector. This Coalition was created as a public/private partnership by  the U.S. Treasury, FDIC, Alabama State Banking Department and the Alabama Bankers  Association in June 2006 post the 2005 Hurricane Katrina experience. The Coalition has assisted  the industry in preparation, planning, exercises, information and best practice sharing among  banks in the State of Alabama for 16 years. There are other states and areas of the country that  also have similar Coalitions. There are answers to the topic of the Federal Register without adding  more regulatory burden on the banking industry which may result in overall reduction in the  number of banks which could result in a degradation of the level of financial services available to  communities throughout our great nation impacting the customers we all are collectively focused  on serving.  While the proposed Principles are represented to only affect larger banks, the purpose of our  comments herein are too strongly recommend that there is no need for adoption at the smaller  bank level and if adopted in the future could cause significant harm to community banking as a  whole.  We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this topic and respectfully submit this  comment letter for your consideration.  President  CDE/kbs  3","Bryant Bank, a community bank in Alabama, responds to the FDIC's proposed ""Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions."" The bank argues that while the principles target institutions with over $100 billion in assets, they could inadvertently affect smaller banks. Bryant Bank contends that existing risk management practices are sufficient and that additional climate-related regulations could impose unnecessary burdens on community banks, potentially leading to increased costs, reduced commerce, and more mergers. The bank emphasizes the importance of preserving the community banking model, which proved effective during events like the 2011 Alabama tornadoes and the COVID-19 pandemic. Bryant Bank highlights its involvement in the Alabama Recovery Coalition for the Financial Sector, which aids in disaster preparedness and response. The bank urges against extending the proposed principles to smaller banks, warning of potential harm to community banking and financial services availability."
2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-047,"June 3rd, 2022    RE: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions  Attention: RIN 3064-ZA32    Dear Chairman Gruenberg,  We are pleased to submit comments in response to the request for public feedback on the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) recent publication of the Principles for Climate-Related Financial  Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions on behalf of RMI’s Center for Climate-Aligned Finance.  We strongly agree with and welcome the FDIC’s acknowledgement of the threats that climate change  poses to the safety and stability of individual banks, the banking sector, and the US financial system  overall.  Background on RMI and Our Expertise   RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms global energy systems through market  driven solutions to align with a 1.5°C future and secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all.  We work in the world's most critical geographies and engage businesses, policymakers, communities,  and NGOs to identify and scale energy system interventions that will cut greenhouse gas emissions at  least 50 percent by 2030.   In July 2020, RMI launched the Center for Climate-Aligned Finance (the Center) to help the financial  sector transition the global economy toward a zero-carbon, 1.5°C future. Through deep partnerships in  finance, industry, government, and civil society, the Center works to develop decarbonization  agreements for high-emitting sectors and supports financial institutions to decarbonize their loan books  and investment portfolios. The Center also works to shape the financial sector’s operating environment  by addressing barriers common to all financial institutions, including those related to financial  regulation.   Beyond Risk Management to Ensure Safety and Soundness   As the FDIC has noted, climate change represents a material financial risk to both individual financial  institutions and the stability of both the domestic and international financial system overall. The price  tag for climate-related damages is already sizeable1 and growing, and there is undeniable momentum  behind a global transition to net-zero. This trend is especially clear within the US financial sector where  net-zero climate commitments have become commonplace, including from seven of the ten largest  commercial banks. This is also true among smaller and regional banks, where attention to climate- related risks is growing through initiatives such as the RMA Regional Bank Climate Risk Consortium, a  consortium dedicated to preparing mid-tier lending institutions for the transition to a low-carbon  economy.2 In other words, banks of all sizes have publicly recognized the need for a new approach to  business-as-usual to effectively address the risks presented by climate change.     1 https://aon.mediaroom.com/2021-01-25-Aon-finds-climate-influenced-weather-is-key-driver-of-268B-global-damage-from- 2020-natural-disasters-with-64-uninsured  2 https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rma-forms-new-climate-risk-consortium-for-regional-banks- 301508903.html#:~:text=RMA%20promotes%20an%20enterprise%20approach,well%20as%20nonbank%20financial%20institut ions. 
  In 2021, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) acknowledged that climate change represents a  systemic risk to financial stability and the health of the entire economy. Banking institutions, whose  portfolios comprise a wide variety of interconnected exposures, are especially exposed to climate- related risks. Climate commitments from banks are a welcome step but implementing commitments will  require sweeping changes to the way banks approach their governance, risk assessments, and lending  decisions. Banks can no longer mitigate climate-related risks through hedges or minor adjustments to  their businesses or loan books. Research by Ceres found that the cumulative exposure to the largest US  banks’ syndicated loan portfolios alone could be larger than $500 billion from transition risks3 and over  $250 billion from physical risks,4 far exceeding currently disclosed estimates. In another study from  Cambridge University, researchers found that approximately half of the expected losses that a typical  equity investment would face in response to climate-induced economic shocks would be unhedgeable  unless there is a system-wide response to climate change.5 Accordingly, it is imperative that regulatory  guidance evolve in step, if not ahead of, necessary changes to banking practices.  Relatedly, we also urge the FDIC to evaluate the need for a more systemic approach to effectively  monitor individual bank operations. The FDIC is entrusted with ensuring the safety and soundness of  individual institutions, but, in the context of climate change, the safety and soundness of individual  institutions cannot be determined from individual risk exposures in isolation of broader financial system  dynamics. Given that climate-related financial risks are systemic6 and often endogenous,7 we argue that  the best defense is a good offense, and that banks themselves have a proactive role to play.   Reactive risk mitigation by individual banks fails to address the root of systemic risks. Further, the  endogenous nature of climate-related risks means they are, at least in part, driven by actions taken by  market actors, including financial institutions and regulators.8 Rather than reacting to risks as they  materialize, banks can take steps to proactively address drivers of future climate-related risks through  their pricing strategies and lending decisions. The FDIC, alongside peer regulators, has an opportunity to  pursue a more robust approach to ensuring banks’ safety and soundness by encouraging and  empowering banks to play a proactive role in facilitating a timely, inclusive transition of the real  economy toward net-zero, thereby mitigating a driving source of climate-related financial risks into the  future. A more proactive approach can deliver the dual benefits of reducing individual risk exposures,  while contributing to the long-term reduction of systemic climate-related financial risks facing the US  economy. Such an approach is central to the concept of “climate alignment”9 and our work at the  Center, where we support financial institutions in understanding, leveraging, and capitalizing on their  role in the climate transition.10    3 https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2020-10/Ceres%20Bank%20Risk%20Report%202020%20FINAL.pdf  4 https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/2021- 09/Ceres%20Financing%20a%20Net%20Zero%20Economy%20FINAL.pdf  5 https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/system/files/documents/unhedgeable-risk.pdf  6 https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/261/FSOC-Climate-Report.pdf  7Chenet, Ryan-Collins, van Lerven (2019) Climate-related financial policy in a world of radical uncertainty: Towards a  precautionary approach. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/sites/public-purpose/files/iipp-wp-2019-13-climate- related-financial-policy-in-a-world-of-radical-undertainty-web.pdf  8 Danielsson, Song Shin, Zigrand (2009) Risk Appetite and Endogenous Risk. https://www.fmg.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020- 08/risk-apetite.pdf  9 https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/impact_principles_for_climate_aligned_finance_report.pdf  10 https://climatealignment.org/ 
  Climate Risks are Relevant for All Banks  While more detailed guidance from the FDIC that further elaborates on the topics discussed in these  Principles will be necessary moving forward, we support the FDIC’s initial approach of issuing high-level  guidance to help banks begin to assess and manage climate-related risks. However, we also believe the  FDIC should appropriately expand and adequately support the implementation of this guidance to all  banks overseen by the agency, including regional, state, and community banks.   Climate change represents a material financial risk to banks of all sizes, and climate-related financial  risks can be concentrated in regions and communities. Compared to larger, more diversified banks,  regional banks may experience higher rates of failure and branch closures in the wake of natural  disasters. Examples can already be seen in the financial sector. For example, consecutive record- breaking losses in 2017 and 2018 California wildfire seasons cost the state’s homeowner's insurance  industry two times the total amount of combined profits since 1991, pushing many smaller insurance  companies to or at the brink of bankruptcy.11 Analysis by Ceres has shown that over 60% of US credit  unions, which similarly face highly concentrated physical and transition risks, are at physical risk due to  both acute and chronic climate-related weather events and hazards while over 7% of Federally- chartered credit unions face moderate to high disruption due to membership fields aligned with carbon- intensive industries.12   Regional, state, and community banks overseen by the FDIC face similar climate-related risks but are  often the least equipped to understand or prepare for them.13 This problem is compounded by the types  of exposures that these banks face. In one study of all domestic FDIC-insured banks, smaller banks were  shown to lend significantly more to small businesses than larger banks, and small businesses as  counterparties often lack capacity to absorb climate-related shocks.14 For example, according to the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 40% of businesses do not reopen after a disaster, and  businesses that do survive may continue to suffer from a lack of access to credit and other vital financial  services.15 Additionally, smaller banks often are exposed to a higher concentration of counterparties in  specific industries, which can be a source of significant transition risk. For example, Zions  Bancorporation, a regional bank operating in the Southwestern US, held collective commercial loan  exposure to mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction of $1.185 billion in 2021. This exposure  represented over 19.5% of its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, meaning that a default of some of  these loans could push the bank’s solvency buffer below regulatory minimums.16 This is especially  relevant for the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), the stability of which is dependent upon the sound  risk management practices, capital adequacy, and future earnings potential of individual members, all of  which could be dramatically impacted by climate change.17 For example, correlated failures among  smaller banks created losses in significant excess of fund revenues during the finanical crisis of 2008 and    11 https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/FIO_Climate_RFI.pdf  12  https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/202205/561_The%20Changing%20Climate%20for%20Credit%20Unions.pdf  13 See “Impact on Community Banks and Credit Unions”,  https://www.ceres.org/sites/default/files/reports/202109/Ceres%20Financing%20a%20Net%20Zero%20Economy%20FINAL.pd f  14 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560620302370  15 https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2017/SBCS-Report-on-Disaster-Affected-Firms.pdf  16 https://www.climateriskreview.com/p/us-regional-banks-team-up-to-tackle?s=r  17 https://www.fdic.gov/about/strategic-plans/performance/2022annualplan.pdf 
  2009, prompting the FDIC to take emergency action to maintain fund liquidity.18 Correlated losses  among smaller financial firms due to physical and transition risk events can also aggregately drive  disruption and economic stress throughout the entirety of the US financial system.19   Smaller and regional financial institutions are only beginning to examine and address climate-related  risks. This is especially true as many smaller, publicly traded banks prepare for compliance with other  climate-related financial regulation, such as the SEC’s proposal for climate-related financial disclosures.  We encourage the FDIC to look to developing more tailored resources, tools, and guidance for these  institutions to increase the resiliency of the US financial system against climate-related risks.   Support for the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management  While we believe a wider and more proactive approach to regulation is the best way to meaningfully  address climate-related financial risks, we firmly support the FDIC’s draft principles as a complementary  first step. The Center especially supports the following elements of the proposed principles:   1. Making internal strategies consistent with public-facing climate commitments. Operationalizing  and substantiating existing public climate commitments, such as through interim targets20 and  transition plans,21 will require a significant overhaul of how banks conduct business today, especially  smaller banks. Public climate commitments and targets can send a powerful signal of intent,  including internally across banks’ business units. But commitments are only a first step, and the FDIC  is right to call for evidence on how banks organize their businesses to reflect their stated intent.   2. Incorporating climate-related risk management throughout business units. A pre-requisite to  implementing firm-wide climate commitments is the integration of climate-aligned strategies  throughout a bank’s business. Effective climate-related risk management can help banks meet  climate commitments, but as described above, climate risk management and climate alignment are  distinct concepts. They have distinct goals and often lead to different outcomes.22 Empowering  banks to incorporate climate-related risk management at every level of their business will support  banks in better understanding the myriad ways climate risks impact their firm. From here, internal  strategies must go a step further to be consistent with climate alignment commitments. By  proactively acting, through financial and non-financial activities, to mitigate climate risks, integrating  climate alignment strategies inherently supports better integration of risk management.  Our report, Zeroing In: The US Financial Sector Perspective on Net-Zero Lending and Investing,23 is  based on a series of workshops the Center held in December 2020 with nine US banks and ten  institutional investors to understand the challenges they face in implementing climate alignment  commitments. During these workshops, participants from US banks highlighted internal challenges  as a top barrier. One participant likened the transformation necessary for meeting climate  commitments to “changing the DNA of an organization”, requiring an evolution of all business units,  functions, and operational infrastructure. To enable this holistic transformation, participants noted    18 https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/crisis/chap5.pdf  19 https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47026  20 https://rmi.org/how-the-net-zero-banking-alliance-helps-banks-set-interim-emissions-targets/  21 https://rmi.org/five-trends-to-watch-in-climate-aligned-finance-in-2022/  22 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20430795.2020.1848142  23 36 https://rmi.org/insight/zeroing-in/ 
  the need for buy-in from executive leadership and culture change throughout the institution –  including by embedding climate values with portfolio managers and front-office investment teams.  Regulatory clarity was cited as a key opportunity to accelerate these processes, providing the  confidence necessary to reshape internal cultures.   3. Assessing climate risks differently than other financial risks. As the FDIC recognizes, climate poses  meaningful financial risks to US banks. However, because these risks are substantially different from  traditional financial risks, a different approach is required to evaluate their true magnitude and  scope. For one, both physical and transition risks will materialize over longer time periods than  many banks’ strategic planning horizons and must be analyzed accordingly over longer timelines.  Further, as the FDIC’s guidance suggests, it is important for banks to monitor and assess physical and  transition risk exposures across various segments of the economy and a bank’s portfolio, including  potential correlations across those risks. We echoed these positions in a recent analysis of the FSOC  Report on Climate-Related Financial Risks:  Systemic risk means that one financial actor’s vulnerability (or climate risk exposure) can  jeopardize the well-being of other financial actors, corporates, and households economy-wide.  Like dominoes, systemic risks can be passed through “transmission channels,” impacting  seemingly disconnected parts of the economy. Acknowledging that climate risks are dynamic  and interconnected directly challenges traditional approaches to assessing materiality and risk  on an individual asset basis. Instead, systemic risks such as these must be assessed across an  entire portfolio or the financial system as a whole.24  For instance, while the physical risks facing loans to coastal properties may be predictable through  first-order impacts, the complex transmission pathways for climate-related risk factors across entire  economies and lending portfolios require a broader scope and further scrutiny.  4. Developing clear definitions of possible climate-related risk exposures and metrics for setting  limits to those exposures. Despite potential data or methodological uncertainties, starting the  process of measuring banks’ exposures to climate-related financial risks can help spur the  operationalization of climate strategies to reduce those exposures. This includes identifying  essential data needs, engaging counterparties to develop and implement transition plans, and  prioritizing actions based on where attention and resources are needed most, first. Climate risks do  not necessarily require divestment to be mitigated. Clear and consistent metrics can help banks  identify and work to proactively reduce their climate-related exposures, such as by working with  counterparties to develop and implement transition plans. Metrics can also help banks make  meaningful progress on integrating organization-wide climate risk assessments and monitoring  capabilities. Finally, we support the inclusion of escalation procedures to encourage attention to  climate-related exposures by boards and management.   5. Iteratively utilizing measurement methodologies, models, and data for analyzing climate-related  financial risks as they evolve and mature. To steer portfolios to align with their climate goals, banks  will require data and metrics that are granular (i.e., asset-specific), forward-looking, and address the  most significant drivers of emissions.25 While data and disclosures are constantly improving, we    24 https://rmi.org/we-read-a-130-page-report-on-climate-regulation-so-you-dont-have-to/  25 https://climatealignment.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/impact_principles_for_climate_aligned_finance_report.pdf 
  support the FDIC’s guidance that banks should act now with best available resources, and then seek  to integrate updated resources over time. In its 2021 report, FSOC advised that not only can tools  like scenario analysis be used to assess climate risks in the absence of perfect data, but their use can  support data improvements over time.26 Where data gaps persist, we encourage that banks actively  seek data directly with corporates and/or through collaborative partnerships with peers, data  providers, and regulators to drive improved data accuracy and availability. To reinforce these  efforts, we encourage the FDIC, in line with FSOC's recommendations, to work with the banking  sector and other financial regulators to improve the availability and quality of climate-related  models and data.   6. Managing fair lending concerns for low- to moderate-income (LMI) communities. We strongly  support the FDIC’s disparate impact standard in examining banks’ responses to climate exposures,  and we agree that banks would benefit from additional guidance on this matter. A focus on LMI  communities aligns with FSOC’s acknowledgement that low-income and historically disadvantaged  communities are not only disproportionately impacted by climate change but also the least  equipped to cope with climate shocks. This dynamic exacerbates existing inequalities and amplifies  risks to the financial sector overall when shocks occur. Improving the availability and accessibility of  financial products and services is essential for enabling an inclusive, economy-wide transition,  thereby reducing one driver of systemic risks. This will require a dedicated, tailored approach by  financial institutions to meet the unique needs of these communities. Further, regional and  community banks, which play an outsized role in LMI and rural communities, are under-resourced to  address climate risks. We understand FDIC’s initial focus on developing principles for large banks.  However, moving forward, providing tailored guidance and support to regional and community  banks, including ensuring their access to quality data, tools, and services, will be especially  important.   In conclusion, climate-related physical and transition risks are widely accepted to be prevalent and  material to US banks of all sizes, with stark implications for the US economy, including financial markets,  communities, and households nationwide. We support the FDIC‘s efforts to revisit and update guidance  for the safe and sound management of climate-related financial risks in this unprecedented and evolving  operating environment to proactively mitigate their most severe impacts.

Gruenberg, Acting Chair  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street, NW  Washington, DC 20429  Via Email to comments@fdic.gov    Re:   RIN 3064–ZA32 – Request for Comment on Statement of Principles for Climate-   Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions     Dear Acting Chair Gruenberg,  It is a pleasure to submit comments on behalf of Ceres and the Ceres Accelerator for  Sustainable Capital Markets. Ceres is a nonprofit organization with over 30-years of  experience working on climate change. The Ceres Accelerator works to transform the  practices and policies that govern capital markets in order to reduce the worst financial  impacts of the climate crisis. It spurs capital market influencers to act on climate change  as a systemic financial risk—driving the large-scale behavior and systems change needed  to achieve a just and sustainable future and a net zero emissions economy.    Ceres works with leading global investors and companies. Our Investor Network is currently  over 220 investors that collectively manage over $60 trillion in assets. Ceres is a founding  partner of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and the Paris Aligned Investor Initiative,  which includes investors focused on sustainable investments within their portfolios and  other assets. Our Company Network includes approximately 60 of the largest global  companies with whom we work on an in-depth basis on climate strategy and disclosure,  among other issues.  We congratulate the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for designing this  Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (Principles or Climate Principles). We also commend the FDIC for the  preliminary research the agency has initiated on climate-related financial risk, its  establishment of the interdisciplinary Climate Working Group, and the recent interagency 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       2  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) to update the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)  regulations, which includes climate resiliency considerations. We also recognize that the  OCC issued substantially similar guidance for comment in December 2021. There would be  great benefit in the FDIC, OCC, and Fed working together on consistent climate principles.  Issuance of uniform, binding guidance by the three banking agencies could avoid  regulatory inconsistency, send a strong signal to the banking industry, and ease  compliance costs for regulated entities.  Below, we provide our comments to the questions posed in the Climate Principles. We have  also included an attachment containing operational and tactical recommendations  previously submitted to the FDIC meant to further support your vital work on climate and  the investments required to address the FSOC report recommendations (please see  Attachment 1). Because this memo was submitted in December 2021, we note that the FDIC  has already taken some of these suggested actions.  Applicability   1. What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model, should  inform financial institutions’ adoption of these principles?  We agree with the FDIC that all banks, regardless of size, may have material exposures to  climate-related financial risks. Furthermore, although these Principles closely track the  FDIC’s existing management for large banks, they target only those banks with over $100  billion in total consolidated assets (i.e., the largest financial institutions).   While this may be a reasonable starting point, all financial institutions face climate-related  financial risks, not just those over $100 billion in assets. The FDIC’s rule requiring certain  insured depository institutions to submit resolution plans has a threshold for banks with  over $50 billion in total assets due to the understanding that the failure of such institutions  would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States.1 Additionally,  regional banks may experience higher rates of failure and closures due to lower  diversification and geographical concentration. Ceres hopes the FDIC will utilize the $50  billion threshold, as these institutions already employ sophisticated risk management    1 See 12 C.F.R. § 360.10. 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       3  practices and should thus be capable of incorporating climate-related financial risks into  their risk frameworks.  Ceres believes that climate change risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets,  similar to cyber security risks and the coronavirus pandemic, posing grave threats to banks  of all sizes and business models. Moreover this risk is only increasing in terms of frequency  and severity. According to NOAA, in 2021 there were 20 separate weather and climate  disaster events where losses exceeded $1 billion.  Furthermore, these climate disasters  killed 688 people and cost the United States more than $145 billion last year.  These acute and progressive physical risks have the potential to seriously disrupt the bank  market as well as the communities they serve. For example, more than 40 percent of  Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters in 2021 and more than 80 percent of  Americans experienced a heat wave. Climate impacts are already manifesting in the largest  state economies. In just the last few years, California has experienced recording-breaking  wildfires, in both number and size, that have taken hundreds of lives, bankrupted the state’s  largest utility, left millions regularly without power and brought home insurability into  question. Florida is facing rapidly rising sea levels and now-routine flooding that are eroding  coastal property values and wiping out freshwater supplies.   Climate risk is an existential threat and, as recently stated by the thoughtful and  comprehensive October 2021 Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) Report on  Climate-related Financial Risk, is one that poses an emerging and increasing threat to U.S.  financial stability. As such, we recommend that these principles be adopted by all U.S.  banks irrespective of asset size, location, or business model.    Tailoring   2. How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its climate- related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk  profile, and scope of operations?   The FDIC has designed these Principles to target the largest financial institutions, although  it acknowledges that “all financial institutions, regardless of size, may have material  exposures to climate-related financial risks.” In general, Ceres recommends that, as  financial institutions and the FDIC become more adept at incorporating climate-related  financial risk management practices, the FDIC lower this threshold to include more than the 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       4  largest banks over time as these standards evolve. However, we acknowledge that smaller  banks, community banks, and credit unions have different capabilities than the largest  banks. The FDIC should therefore tailor its approach to accommodate for those size,  complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations differences.   To this end, Ceres suggests the FDIC implement an assessment program similar to the  Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council’s (FFIEC) Cybersecurity Assessment Tool  (CAT), which was launched to assist banks and examiners determine a bank's risk profile  and level of cybersecurity preparedness.2 The FDIC should develop a similar assessment  tool for climate-related financial risk, providing resources to help banks understand  supervisory expectations, how climate risks relate to traditional financial risks, and assess  and manage those risks. Like the CAT, this could include a pilot program at smaller  institutions to enable state and federal regulators to assess how these institutions manage  and mitigate climate risks. Based on this program, the FDIC should publish its observations,  including findings regarding inherent climate-related financial risks and institution  preparedness.   Moreover, Ceres recommends that the FDIC consider using the data it collects from this  program to develop a self-assessment tool to assist smaller institutions in evaluating those  risks and their risk management capabilities. To reflect evolving science and scenario  analysis with a focus on risk management, collaboration, and resilience, the FDIC should  continue to update and publish new data it and the other financial regulators obtain and/or  analyze. This would allow the FDIC to tailor its guidance for smaller institutions, and enable  those institutions to develop climate-related risk management practices without  presenting an undue burden.  Similarly, the FDIC should consider updating its examination manuals to account for  climate-related financial risks, and/or issue an examination manual dedicated to the  identification and management of climate risks based on established risk factors that are  very familiar to financial institutions and examiners. While in the process of amending or  issuing a new manual, the FDIC could start by issuing a new booklet, publishing a policy  statement, or addressing the topic in the periodically published Supervisory Insights or    2 See Attachment 1, Appendix A. 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       5  FDIC Quarterly. Likewise, the FDIC should continue to include climate risk as a risk that may  affect financial institutions or the Deposit Insurance Fund in its annual Risk Review. These  updates as well as the FDIC’s interactions with examiners should be based on financial  institution size and business line.   Ceres also recommends that future guidance assist banks in factoring the climate change- related transition, physical, and reputational risks of their borrowers into their capital, loan  pricing and credit allocation decisions. We believe it is important that large banks do so on  a sector-by-sector basis, with consideration given to the unique transition risks (including  legal and reputational) and physical risks inherent in each industry sector and client  vertical.  We note that some large banks have already developed climate-related financial  risk management practices in line with this guidance. For example, in December 2021 Citi  CEO Jane Fraser stated that Citi will start asking its clients to measure emissions and that a  borrower’s climate impact will factor into lending and capital allocation decisions. In fact,  the January Citi TCFD report addresses some of these issues. Likewise, banks must develop  the ability to assess if climate-related transition and physical risks will cause certain assets  (including trading book assets) to become so illiquid that they are effectively “stranded.”   Future guidance should assist banks in developing plans to unwind such assets, or set  aside more capital against these potential “stranded assets.”  Further, FDIC should provide guidance as to how climate-related financial risks relate to the   CAMELS framework. Climate risk could be treated as a cross-cutting risk that manifests  through these well-recognized and established types of risk. Capital and asset quality could  be significantly affected by both transition and physical risks, particularly where an  institution has geographical or sector concentrations vulnerable to these risks.  Management’s ability to adequately assess, plan for, and mitigate these risks, including  through access to appropriate and timely data to measure the bank’s exposure, could be  factored into the management component. Earnings and liquidity could also be implicated  where a bank has made significant amounts of loans to sectors that are heavily reliant on  fossil fuels and the bank (and its customers) has failed to adequately plan for transition or  the bank’s loans are supported by collateral increasingly at risk from severe weather events  and rising sea levels. 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       6  Additionally, current approaches to climate risk modelling by large banks, treat climate risk  in a manner analogous to credit risk. By this we mean that climate risk is quantified using  sophisticated models, and capital or risk limits are adjusted to account for this risk.  For  banks without these capabilities, or where the cost of implementation would be prohibitive,  we suggest that future FDIC guidance treat climate risk in a more prescriptive manner  similar to its operational risk guidance on cybersecurity. This approach could involve  requiring in-scope banks to assess underwriting of climate-sensitive industries, and in  some cases recommending the complete withdrawal of lending activity from high GHG- emitting sectors where the assessed risk threatens a bank’s safety and soundness.  Finally, Ceres recommends that future guidance for banks and bank holding companies  involved in the trading and marketing of non-renewable commodities (including physical  energy commodities and physical energy commodity derivatives) include a requirement to  disclose the impact of climate-related risk drivers (including operational risk) around these  products and services.  General   3. What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft principles  into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with financial  institutions to understand those challenges?   Ceres maintains an active and regular dialogue with U.S. banks of varying asset size,  location, and business model. Moreover, most of the U.S.-based G-SIBs are members of  Ceres’ Company Network. Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks currently  use some form of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing to  evaluate the transition and physical risks associated with their lending portfolios.  The main  challenges they face in incorporating these principles into their risk management systems  are technical in nature.    For example, even with considerable client engagement, they face difficulty in obtaining  borrower-specific climate data (for example, GHG emissions), and are therefore reliant on  third-party data to provide index information. In some cases, they are unsure of which  climate scenarios are most relevant for their business model, or the most relevant  scenarios do not provide sufficient detail in some areas critical to financial institutions.  
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       7  Ceres also recommends that the FDIC  be clear that having a transition plan is a crucial part  of a bank’s risk management system, and provide guidance as to how these plans should  be formed. When making loans, financial institutions should request data from  counterparties, including governance policies, physical and transition risks, and Scopes 1,  2, and 3 GHG emissions. Obtaining this data will become easier if the SEC’s proposed climate  disclosure rule for public companies comes into effect, as it will allow all financial  institutions to gain more comprehensive and consistent information from their clients.   4. Would regulations or guidelines prescribing particular risk management practices be  helpful to financial institutions as they adjust to doing business in a changing climate?  Although the FDIC’s current consultation seeks to promote a principles-based approach to  improving risk management and supervisory practices related to climate-driven financial  risk, we would encourage FDIC to consider making some or all of these prescriptive and  enforcing them as mandatory requirements as opposed to voluntary best practices.   We believe the FDIC should use its authority under Section 39 of the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act, specifically 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1, to finalize this guidance and issue the final  document as binding safety and soundness supervisory guidelines. Such binding  regulations or guidelines would be beneficial as they would assist financial institutions in  understanding what the FDIC and examiners are looking for. It would also make clear that  climate-related risks are a safety and soundness concern, and would give the FDIC a legal  basis for requiring banks to make necessary changes and bring enforcement actions for  noncompliance. After these guidelines are finalized, the FDIC should continue to create  more in-depth requirements.  It is important to note that the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other  foreign financial regulatory agencies are already taking these steps.3 The FDIC should make  use of the data these prudential authorities and their regulated entities have already  collected and analyzed, including scenario analyses and stress tests.    3 Central banks that are beginning to regulate climate-related financial risk and/or plan mandatory  scenario analyses include the European Central Bank, England, France, Australia, the  Netherlands, Japan, Singapore, and Canada.  
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       8  Current Risk Management Practices   5. What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to successfully  incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks?   Many financial institutions have identified specific tools and/or strategies in at least some  detail in their general reporting, integrating climate risk into existing risk types and systems  rather than treating it as a separate risk.  When banks are unable to quantify risks, they have  reverted to describing the risks in qualitative terms, which we would consider a minimum  threshold for climate risk management.  6. How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial risks are  material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?  The FDIC should provide clear guidance on the minimum requirements to conduct a  materiality assessment. In conducting these assessments, financial institutions should be  required to report their results, including what data was used in the assessment to allow  comparability across sectors, and an explanation of why information was determined  material or not. Banks should also focus their assessments on financial opportunities as  well as financial risks. Information banks should consider in making materiality assessment  include context-specific metrics such as asset locations, local laws, and geographical  information. Determination of whether such climate-related financial risks are material  should mirror those determinations made in other risks assessments by a bank.   7. What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and  assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?   Ceres research from 2019 shows that only one of nine banks studied is looking at a risk  management time horizon longer than five years. Two others are looking longer term with  respect to climate risk, but not for more conventional risks like credit risk or market risk.  While there may have been some movement toward long-termism in the last two years,  most banks are still focused on the one- to five-year time horizon. It is clear that to fully  understand the climate risks banks face to their safety and soundness, they need to look at  a longer time frame. In 2020, Ceres produced a report highlighting the risk due to transition  risks of the largest banks. In 2021, we prepared an analysis of the physical risks of climate 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       9  change to banks. Both of these reports highlight the imperative to have a longer time frame  in the analysis.   8. What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies – for example, insurance or  derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments – do financial institutions use  to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks?   Based on Ceres’ interactions, many of the largest financial institutions have used, or have  considered using both insurance and carbon offsets to mitigate climate-related financial  risks.  Regarding the use of insurance contracts, we believe that the residential mortgage  divisions of large banks are directly exposed to the risk of insurance price increases or  coverage withdrawal.  Specifically, with the recent increase in acute climate-related  physical risk comes the specter of home insurance price increases or possible denial of  coverage in certain areas. For example, AIG recently announced plans to leave the  California market due to climate risks. There are significant risks in the insurance industry  as noted in this recent analysis. The most recent NOAA data shows that the U.S. has  experienced 20 separate billion dollar weather and climate disasters in 2021.   Ceres believes that the bank market’s reliance on the availability of home insurance for its  residential mortgage portfolio could lead to a climate-related gap in risk monitoring. As  such, we recommend that banks study the potential impact of residential property  insurance price increases or coverage withdrawal on the value, default rate, loss given  default, and financing cost of residential mortgage portfolio holdings.  Similarly, banks use  insurance and derivatives to hedge climate-related risks at the loan and portfolio level, but  this does not eliminate the systemic risk, as that risk is assumed by the firm to which the  risk is transferred. With hedging also comes systemic risk concerns, especially where one  firm is providing most of the climate risk protection. We recommend the FDIC discuss these  risks in its next Risk Review and/or Supervisory Insights. There is also similar risk in other  portions of banks portfolios.4     4 Our 2020 report highlights the risk by various sectors.  
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       10  With regards to the use of carbon offset credits (or other similar carbon trading schemes)  as a risk mitigation strategy, Ceres recommends that the primary focus of banks should be  on “absolute GHG reductions” through client engagement as opposed to “net GHG  reductions” via financial engineering.  As such GHG offset strategies should be used  sparingly and only as a last resort. Ceres has produced a report, The Role of Natural Climate  Solutions in Corporate Climate Commitments: A Brief for Investors, to help banks and other  end-users understand best practices when using this risk mitigation tool.  Outside of insurance and offsets, financial institutions’ relationships with their clients must  be at the heart of any strategy for climate risk mitigation. Arguments that large financial  institutions “bank the entire economy” and as a result have no pathway to reduce their  climate risk miss the critical role of client engagement and transition. Business within a  sector can gradually be shifted towards companies with a higher share of sustainable  assets and/or robust transition plans.  The recently released 2030 plans from a few of the  largest banks take initial steps with some of their client sectors. While additional actions  are needed, these are good initial steps.  For example, if a bank weighted its exposure to the utility sector heavily toward renewables  and its exposure to the auto sector toward electric vehicles, Ceres analysis shows that  some transition risk could be offset by the de-risking of green investments that would occur  in a rapid transition scenario. Our analysis also shows the extent to which a bank’s  vulnerability to transition risk is extremely sensitive to the choice of clients in climate- relevant sectors. The availability of “investable opportunities” is an important factor in how  easy it is to mitigate risk through sustainable finance. The current structure of the economy  will mean that most banks, particularly the largest ones, will have a “long” exposure to the  business-as-usual case and a “short” exposure to the transition scenario. However,  proactive banks may be able to capture enough sustainable opportunities to adjust this  balance in a way that manages their overall transition risk.       
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       11  9. What, if any, climate-related financial products or services – for example, “green  bonds,” derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take  climate-related considerations into account – do banks offer to clients and customers?  What risks, if any, do these products or services pose?   Based on our interactions, many of the largest banks currently offer their borrowers a  variety of “green” products, such as sustainability-linked loans, derivatives with embedded  sustainability KPIs, etc.  While we encourage banks to support their client’s climate risk  management and sustainability efforts, banks should pay attention to the potential unique  reputational risks these products entail, such as the risk of “greenwashing” by the bank  and/or the borrower.  Greenwashing is the process of knowingly or unknowingly conveying  a false impression as to how sustainable or environmentally sound a product or service  actually is. It can occur when the benefits conferred by the product or service are not  material to the bank or borrower, or relevant to the borrower’s primary business activity.  Such practices may also be considered “deceptive” under Section 5 of the Federal Trade  Commission Act, which is enforced by the FDIC for state nonmember institutions.   As such, we ask the FDIC to consider highlighting this risk in its next Supervisory Insights,  and continue doing so in future Risk Reviews as it did in May 2022. We also encourage the  FDIC to require that bank compliance frameworks are updated to include greenwashing  surveillance similar to the SEC’s current initiatives to proactively identify ESG-related  misconduct.  10. How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate-related  financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and  communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Should the  agencies modify existing regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the  Community Reinvestment Act, to address the impact climate-related financial risks  may have on LMI and other disadvantaged communities?  For financial institutions to credibly assess the impacts of climate-related financial risk  mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, specifically  LMI and other disadvantaged communities, Ceres recommends that banks commit to  principles of diversity, equity and inclusion and that bank board members and senior  management are selected from a diverse and inclusive pool of candidates drawn from the 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       12  communities that the financial institutions serve. Incorporating the principles of a just and  inclusive economy is foundational to any effective climate risk management regime.   Moreover, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), FDIC, and Federal Reserve  Board (Fed) should incorporate into its final interagency Community Reinvestment Act  (CRA) regulations expectations on how banks should consider the impacts of climate- related financial risk on LMI and other disadvantaged communities. Ceres commends  these agencies for releasing this proposed rule, and for including activities that promote  climate resiliency and disaster preparedness as activities that qualify under the CRA for  community development purposes. We have previously submitted comments on the CRA  to support this important work, and will be submitting a more detailed comment to this new  proposed rule in addition to what is noted  below.   Ceres recommends the agencies develop CRA examination procedures to assess  individual bank climate-related performance and to collect aggregate industry data on LMI  individuals and communities. The FDIC should also consider incorporating explicit  provisions for climate resilience and race as interrelated stability risks which banks must  address. This could include activities that support climate resiliency such as explicitly  targeting LMI communities of color for investments in urban infrastructure to boost  extreme weather resilience; investments in renewable energy and water conservation  projects for affordable housing to reduce utility payments; investments in flood resilience  activities; and installation of air conditioning in multifamily buildings to reduce heat risks  and utility payments.5 Likewise, the FDIC should incorporate the insights and analysis  produced by the Financial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC)6 - of which the FDIC is    5 Although these projects exemplify the beneficial objectives of climate change resilience financing,  it is not intended as an exhaustive list of activities that banks should consider in addressing the  impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on LMI  communities and communities of color.   6 Under FSOC recommendations 1.8 and 1.9, Treasury and FLEC members should “evaluate climate- related impacts and the impacts of proposed policy solutions on financially vulnerable populations  when assessing the impact of climate change on the economy and the financial system,” and  “engage other members ... to analyze and understand the impact of climate change on the financial  well-being of financially vulnerable populations.” 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       13  a member - into its expectations on how banks consider climate-related financial risks on  LMI and other disadvantaged communities.   Further, to properly address the impacts of climate-related financial risk mitigation  strategies and financial products on households in LMI and other disadvantaged  communities, bank board members and senior management must have proven climate  risk management competence, training and experience.  To ensure that board members  have access to climate and ESG training, Ceres has partnered with Berkeley Law school to  offer an online training program which pinpoints how corporate board members can embed  ESG into their oversight role. We encourage all bank board directors to participate in  appropriate continuing education on these vital issues. We also encourage banks to build  on their current efforts to include diverse voices into various levels of decision-making. It is  important to have individuals representing different life experiences to advice on key  financial decisions.  Additionally, the FDIC should require banks consider whether their climate risk mitigation  efforts have fair lending implications, and ensure that examiners and enforcement officials  are sufficiently trained to identify issues that may result in disparate treatment. To this end,  we recommend the FDIC consider issuing guidance that explains how banks could  inadvertently engage in discriminatory practices when addressing climate-related  financial risks.    Data, Disclosures, and Reporting   11. What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models from borrowers  and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure, monitor,  and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial institutions  currently obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect  to these data, metrics, tools or models?  Ceres has published two reports on climate-related financial risks for banks – one on  Transition Risk and another on Physical Risk.  In these reports, we recommend that banks  engage with their borrowing clients on a sector-by-sector basis to obtain climate-relevant  data, with consideration given to the unique transition risks (including legal and  reputational) and physical risks inherent to each industry sector. Banks should update or 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       14  refine their decisions based on this data as they obtain new information. Specifically, we  recommend that banks obtain the following data in support of effective climate risk  management:  •  Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions data from borrowers;  •  Information on planned capital expenditures and their likely impact on company  emissions, as well as transition plans (if available);  •  Geolocational information of all critical borrower infrastructure; and  •  Borrower climate disclosures prepared using the TCFD framework (banks should  encourage borrowers to disclose this information using the TCFD framework to  ensure that climate-relevant data is comparable across industries and  geographies).  To minimize compliance costs, the FDIC should also encourage and incentivize banks to  actively contribute to the development and sharing of climate-relevant borrower data, as  appropriate. Banks should collaborate with customers, peers, academics, and regulators  to obtain and understand these data. The FDIC should also encourage banks to use a  common set of standards, such as the PCAF framework, for measuring their Scope 3  emissions associated with client activities.7 Without a standardized framework, it may be  difficult to accurately assess banks’ risk and the effectiveness of their mitigation strategies.  Additionally, banks can take action on many climate-related financial issues despite  uncertainty in other areas. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services  notes that institutions “should establish board governance and an organization structure  that supports the effective management of climate risks and develop their expertise and  capacity to assess and manage climate risks on both sides of their balance sheets.” Such  actions could “be implemented with relative speed and confidence.”     7 Investors are increasingly requesting companies’ Scope 3 data, and the SEC’s proposed climate  disclosure rule includes Scope 3 disclosures. If the SEC includes Scope 3 in its final rule, this will  decrease the burden on compliance with any future FDIC rules, and the FDIC could coordinate with  the SEC on this issue.  
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       15  12. How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better  capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?  In our two recent reports on climate-related financial risks for banks (Transition Risk and  Physical Risk reports) we make recommendations that the existing capital adequacy  regime be expanded to include climate stress testing with eventual adjustments to both  bank liquidity and capital requirements. In 2021, Ceres also provided testimony to the United  States House of Representatives on the importance of climate stress tests as part of an  effective bank capital adequacy regime.   Additionally, Ceres recommends that the FDIC works with the OCC and the Fed to amend  the Call Report to include information relevant to financial institutions’ climate-related  financial risks. The FDIC should also consider issuing guidance that would provide  standards for financial institutions to ascertain data on their GHG emissions to guarantee  that disclosures among institutions are consistent, comparable, and reliable. Moreover, we  recommend that existing regulatory reporting requirements for banks be expanded to  require the use of the TCFD framework to ensure that public disclosure of climate relevant  information is comparable across banks of varying asset size, location, and business  model.  Furthermore, as part of identifying and quantifying climate-related financial risks, Ceres  believes that large banks should establish and disclose net zero plans which describe in  detail how they plan to decarbonize their business activities and achieve net zero emissions  by no later than 2050. These plans should provide practical, actionable steps for banks to  create an effective net zero transition, including assessment of assets that may be exposed  to climate transition risk, internal valuation tools, and disclosure of risk assessments that  identify climate-relevant sectors and the percentage of at-risk assets in these sectors.  Large banks should also set detailed interim decarbonization goals (for example, 2030 or  2040 Paris-aligned goals) and provide a timeline with regular updates towards achieving  them.8    8 For example, banks could validate their goals through the Science Based Targets initiative, a  recently launched a methodology for banks to set targets that include financed emissions. Although  aligning with this methodology will enhance comparability, banks should focus first on a goal that   
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       16  Finally, all interim goals and 2050 net zero commitments should incorporate the latest  science, use credible climate scenarios, and disclose decarbonization progress on a  sector-by-sector basis. Banks should engage clients on their own climate strategies by, for  example, requiring clients to provide data in key climate-related areas, such as energy  technology and emissions profiles; aggregating those data using methods such as carbon  accounting; and building climate risk into day-to-day decision-making tools, such as client  earnings models. Ceres recommends that the FDIC  also incorporate results from its recent  Call for Papers regarding “net zero goals and their effects on key segments of the finance  industry,” including “integrated assessment models and their usage in a climate-risk loss  forecasting context.” We encourage the FDIC to consider augmenting existing regulatory  reporting requirements to include this additional risk-mitigating disclosure.    Scenario Analysis   13. Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that  requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial  institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they  face?  Ceres maintains an active and regular dialogue with U.S. banks of varying asset size,  location, and business model. Moreover, most of the U.S.-based G-SIBs are members of  Ceres’ Company Network.  Based on our interactions, it is clear that the uses and challenges  banks face regarding climate risk management varies greatly by size. For example, many of  the largest banks currently use some form of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate- risk stress testing to evaluate the transition and physical risks associated with their lending  portfolios. The main challenges they face in advancing their climate scenario analysis and  stress testing programs are technical in nature:  •  Even with considerable client engagement, they face difficulty in obtaining  borrower-specific climate data (for example, GHG emissions).    will incentivize action internally and reflect their risk management strategy to the greatest possible  extent. 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       17  •  In general, larger, publicly-listed borrowers are more likely to provide banks with  climate data, whereas small to mid-size and privately-owned borrowers are less  willing or able to generate this information.  •  In some cases, large banks are unsure of which climate scenarios are most relevant  for their business model or the most relevant scenarios do not provide sufficient  detail in some areas critical to financial institutions.  In contrast, the use of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress testing for  regional and community banks can be characterized as being in its infancy.  Moreover, the  main challenges they face in advancing their climate scenario analysis and stress testing  programs are both technical and operational in nature:  •  Some regional and community banks do not yet consider climate to be a material  risk factor, and so are not engaging their borrowers in obtaining climate-relevant  data.  •  When client engagement does occur, borrowers are unable or unwilling to provide  climate data (for example, GHG emissions).  •  In some cases, regional and community banks are unsure of which climate  scenarios are most relevant for their business model.  •  Often, banks wait for regulatory guidance before investing resources in the design  of climate-risk scenario analysis and/or climate-risk stress capabilities.  14. What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and executing  scenario analysis exercises?  When designing and executing scenario analysis, at a micro-level, we believe that the  scientific rigor and transparency of the scenarios are paramount. As such, banks should  ensure that their scenarios:  •  Are science-based and aligned with the most current climate science;  •  For transition risk, the scenarios should consider both an “orderly” and “disorderly”  transition;  •  For physical risk, the scenarios should contain at least one ""worst case"" scenario;  •  Assumptions regarding both demand and prices for commodities (such as oil)  should be transparent and clearly stated; and 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       18  •  Scenarios should be aligned with current best practices (i.e., IEA and NGFS  scenarios).  From a macro-standpoint, the U.S. regulatory regime has proven itself to be robust and  flexible enough to meet the challenge of many recent perils.  For example, through  necessity and quick action, regulators have been able to successfully navigate new threats  to bank safety and soundness such as cybersecurity and the coronavirus pandemic.  Thus, when considering which macro factors are most salient to designing and executing  climate scenario analysis, we recommend first and foremost that the FDIC continue to act  with a sense of urgency around this existential and systemic threat. The FDIC should begin  conducting these exercises quickly. Although initial models may be simplistic, the FDIC  should eventually provide multiple scenarios as described above.   Second, as climate risk permeates all aspects of the capital markets and poses grave  threats to financial institutions of all sizes and business models, we recommend that these  scenario analyses eventually be adopted by all U.S. banks irrespective of asset size,  location, or business model. For example, regional banks may experience higher rates of  failure climate events and natural disasters that impact discrete geographic areas.  Scenario analysis implementation could initially be tailored by bank size, with the threshold  lowered overtime as more data becomes available to smaller banks, allowing those banks  to build capacity.   Third, the FDIC must ensure that banks have access to educational resources in support of  bank innovation regarding climate scenarios, models, and data.   Finally, we believe that climate scenario analysis exercises should eventually evolve into a  formalized climate stress testing regime which informs regulatory capital adequacy  metrics. The FDIC should also review financial institutions’ models to ensure they are  suitably robust, and that financial institutions are not “model shopping” to avoid poor  outcomes. Without climate stress testing (including a comprehensive capital adequacy  regime), we believe that banks are at risk of running a higher quantum of enterprise risk  than they are aware of, posing a danger to the safety and soundness of our financial system.

The  agency’s leadership on this critical issue is deeply valued.  We would be pleased to discuss  any questions you may have on our feedback.

Recommendations for FDIC Action to  Address Climate-related Financial Risks    1. The FDIC should include climate as a risk that may affect banks or the Deposit  Insurance Fund in the Risk Review  The Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) acknowledges the transition risks from  climate to the energy sector.  Given the threats to the stability of the financial system  posed by climate, the FDIC should continue to amplify both these transition risks as well as  physical risks in its Risk Review.   In addition, the FDIC refers to climate change and environmental, social, and  governmental (ESG) risk mitigation considerations by banks.  While “understanding  changes in policy, technology, and investor sentiment as they relate to ESG risk” is  important, transition and physical risks to individual banks are a safety and soundness  concern and should be treated as such by the FDIC.  2. The FDIC should issue guidance to regulated banks on climate risk  The FDIC should issue guidance through a Financial Institution Letter (FIL) to first  acknowledge that climate poses risks to both the financial system and to individual  financial institutions and then to provide guidance to FIs on how to identify and monitor  climate-related risks.  3. The FDIC should include climate risk as a supervisory priority in its Annual  Performance Plan  For its 2022 Annual Performance Plan, the FDIC should add a Performance Goal to assess  climate risk in supervised institutions.  The FDIC should also add climate as an “external  factor” that could affect the banking industry and the FDIC.   The pandemic clearly 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       21  demonstrated that external shocks can have a significant impact on the financial services  industry.  While COVID-19 could not have been predicted, climate change and its effects  are occurring today and will continue to worsen.  Climate risk should therefore be a  supervisory priority for the FDIC.  4. The FDIC should conduct a Tech Sprint to identify tools for financial institutions to  measure climate risk  The FDIC has been a leader among financial regulators through its Tech Sprint Program in  using a creative crowdsourcing technique to address complex problems.  The FDIC should  solicit banks, non-profit organizations, technology and data analytics companies, and  other members of the public to convene and collaborate on finding data, tools, and other  measures of climate risks in banks.  Such tools could be helpful for all financial  institutions, but particularly for community banks that may lack the resources or expertise  to measure or monitor such risks.  5. The FDIC should issue an RFI on Climate Risk  The FDIC should issue a Request for Information (RFI) to inform the agency on how banks  in the U.S. and other parts of the world measure and monitor climate risk.  The RFI can ask  for input on how the FDIC  should approach climate from a supervisory perspective.   Finally, the RFI could inquire whether additional guidance from the FDIC would be helpful  to financial institutions as they look to measure and monitor their climate risks.  6. The FDIC should join the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the  Financial System  Like Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN), the Network of Central Banks and  Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is a global network of central banks  and supervisors.  They work together to share their experiences and develop nonbinding  best practices.  The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed or FRB) and the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (OCC joined NGFS in the last year.  The FDIC is already an  active member of the Basel Committee’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Risks  (TFCR).  The FDIC should join the NGFS to both learn from global peers and contribute to  the development of tools and practices to address risks to the financial system from  climate change. 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       22  II. Interagency Recommendations  Interagency Case Studies and Recommendations  Short-term actions by each of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) members  individually is critical to address the risks to the financial system from climate change.   While individual agency actions are important, collective action can sometimes send a  more powerful and consistent message to the financial services industry.  The benefits  from the government acting on a joint or Interagency basis are clear.  Such joint actions  avoid conflicting or duplicative messages which create burden for industry and they can  result in a more efficient allocation of resources by the agencies.  Interagency Case Studies  The agencies have demonstrated in the past that they can work quickly when they believe  an emerging risk is significant and imminent.  Appendix A details two case studies of  timely responses to identified threats to the financial system.  In the first example the  agencies acted together over the course of four years to address the concern that the  effect of the year 2000 date change on computer systems could have severe, far-reaching  consequences for financial institutions.  During the course of the four years, the agencies  issued more than 20 interagency policy statements on multiple related topics, trained and  deployed examiners who conducted multiple examinations at each institution, developed  and disseminated educational content and conducted outreach, tracked and monitored  progress, took action to address deficiencies and engaged in contingency planning.    The second example involves the agencies’ collective action to address increasing  cybersecurity risks.  In roughly a year from identifying cybersecurity as a top priority for  the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), the agencies had  developed a risk assessment tool.  The FFIEC quickly launched a dedicated page on  cybersecurity for financial institutions and examiners, piloted a program at over 500  community institutions to assess management of cyber risks, published general  observations from the pilot, outlined its cybersecurity priorities for the remainder of the  year, and released a Cybersecurity Assessment Tool (CAT).  The agencies have since taken 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       23  additional actions, but their collective efforts to highlight the importance of the issue,  understand its implications for the regulated institutions, and give the industry a self- assessment tool, as well as a tool for examiners, in such a short period of time is  instructive.  These examples are evidence of constructive, timely, coordinated and effective actions  agencies have taken collectively to address emerging issues.  These examples provide a  roadmap for interagency statements, guidance, outreach, training, examination, and  accountability that could all be deployed in addressing climate risks.  Recommended Interagency Actions  1. Conduct a Climate Risk Policy “Sprint”  Regulators have begun to embrace the idea of a “Tech Sprint.”  A Tech Sprint is a short,  time-bound initiative to develop innovative and creative solutions to a specific problem in  a collaborative way.  Pioneered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the concept has  been adopted by both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to solve challenging issues that transcend  the capacity of one agency or organization to tackle.  More recently, the FDIC, FRB, and  OCC announced that they are working on a Digital Assets Sprint Initiative (also called the  Crypto Sprint) and just issued their first interagency statement based on the sprint.  The  purpose of the initiative is to increase collaboration and clarity around digital assets and  involves a series of four sprints to address in a timely manner the many issues raised by  cryptocurrencies.  As stated by Acting Comptroller Hsu in his August 3, 2021 testimony  before the Senate Banking Committee:  The first sprint focuses on developing a common taxonomy for digital assets and  agreed upon definitions to ensure a common language and understanding of the  basic terms and concepts for future discussions. The second sprint centers on  understanding use cases and risks associated with cryptocurrencies and digital  assets. The third sprint concentrates on potential gaps in regulation and  supervision and prioritizing those gaps for additional consideration. The fourth  sprint will consider the policy needs based on the work conducted during the  previous sprints.  
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       24  The FFIEC members should immediately create a Climate Risk Sprint initiative.  This  recommendation is consistent with FSOC Recommendation 2.1 (Fill data gaps) and  Recommendation 2.5 (Data metrics and standardization).  Using the Digital Asset Sprint  Initiative as a model, the agencies should conduct rapid sprints to first develop a common  set of definitions to inform discussions and then review current and evolving risks to  financial institutions.  The agencies should conclude by collaborating in conducting  sprints to evaluate the regulatory and policy gaps in supervision.  Additionally, the FFIEC members could consider a TechSprint that involves the  participation of outside experts – industry representatives, scientists, data specialists – to  collaborate side-by-side with government officials to address potential data and  technology solutions to assessing and managing climate risks.  Such a collaboration  facilitates new and beneficial connections and networks and focuses great energy and  creativity to problem solving in a compressed time period.  This type of TechSprint has  been used repeatedly by the FCA and has also been adopted by the FDIC and CFPB.     2. Establish FFIEC Working Group  As noted in the above case study on cybersecurity, the FFIEC was able to act with relative  speed to address the rising cybersecurity risks to the financial system when it announced  the creation of the Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Working Group (CCIWG).  The  CCIWG was formed in 2013 “to enhance communication among the FFIEC member  agencies and build on existing efforts to strengthen the activities of other interagency and  private sector groups” and quickly rolled out a series of announcements resulting in the  release of the first version of the CAT in 2015.  Similarly, the FFIEC should announce the creation of the Climate Risk Working Group,  reporting to the Council through the Task Force on Supervision (TFOS).  The purpose of the  Climate Risk Working group would be similar to the CCIWG (i.e. enhance communication  among members, and build on existing efforts by other agencies and private sector  groups).  The FFIEC can use the Climate Risk Working Group to develop a means to begin  to assess and enhance the state of industry preparedness.  Finally, the Working Group can  identify gaps in the agencies’ examination procedures and training that can be closed to  strengthen the oversight of climate risk readiness. 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       25    The regulators could also consider establishing a body, such as the UK Climate Financial  Risk Forum (CFRF), composed of industry representatives and convened several times a  year by the regulatory agencies.1  The CFRF has published a couple of best practices  guides to assist financial institutions in identifying climate-related financial risks and  opportunities.  The latest guide is focused on risk management, scenario analysis,  disclosure, innovation and climate data and metrics.     3. Issue Guidance through the FFIEC  Using the CCIWG as a model, the FFIEC should issue Guidance to the industry to raise  awareness of the risks, encourage financial institutions to integrate climate risks into their  enterprise risk frameworks, and provide guidance on how to measure and mitigate risks,  including through best practices.  Guidance can be sequenced to first provide a  declaratory statement that climate is a risk to both the financial system and to individual  institutions.  Subsequent Guidance can address first physical risks and then transition  risks associated with climate change.  Such actions can help fulfill FSOC  Recommendations 4.7 and 4.8 (Review of supervisory and regulatory tools).  Agencies can  also help raise awareness by highlighting relevant events or milestones (see proposed  Climate Risk Awareness Month below).  4. Develop a “Resources” section for climate risk on the FFIEC web page  The FFIEC should develop a page on its website to list resources related to climate risk to  the financial services industry.  First, it can list all Guidance from the FFIEC or from the  member agencies.  The site could also link to other federal resources or agencies that  offer helpful information.  Given the increasing frequency of natural disasters, the  agencies may want to create a section to consolidate interagency statements on  regulatory relief for natural disasters.  The agencies should also amend the Interagency  Supervisory Examiner Guidance for Institutions Affected by a Major Disaster, adopted in  2017, which makes no mention of climate change.  The Guidance should be amended to  cite the risks associated with climate change and note that in many cases, natural  disasters are no longer “exceptional.”  5. Create a Flood Insurance Resource Page and Update Flood Insurance Guidance 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       26  Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 3305(g), the FFIEC is required to consult with the agencies  responsible for supervising for compliance with the National Flood Insurance Program  (FDIC, FRB, National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and OCC as well as the Farm  Credit Administration) and develop uniform standards for use by financial institutions.   While the Task Force on Consumer Compliance (TFCC) has had working groups to develop  flood insurance compliance examination procedures for the agencies as well as  Interagency Questions and Answers Regarding Flood Insurance, no information on the  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is available on the FFIEC website.  The FFIEC  should take the following actions to both facilitate compliance with the NFIP by financial  institutions as well as reduce the risks to financial institutions from uninsured and  underinsured properties:  ● Create a section on the FFIEC website devoted to flood insurance with information  on the NFIP from the agencies or from the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA).  ● Issue updated guidance on flood insurance that incorporates risks from climate  change.  ●  Develop tools to facilitate compliance by financial institutions with the NFIP.  ● Given that the flood insurance maps are out of date and do not reflect current risks,  the agencies should encourage financial institutions to move beyond compliance  with the Flood Disaster Protection Act and recognize that there are substantial  flood risks for properties that do not lie within a flood zone.  Financial Institutions  should therefore consider the safety and soundness risks for uninsured or  underinsured properties that lie outside of a flood zone when underwriting a  mortgage.  6. Amend the Call Report  Under the auspices of the Task Force on Reports (TFOR), the FFIEC should amend the Call  Report to collect information on institutions’ climate-related financial risks, consistent  with the FSOC Recommendations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.7 (Enhancing Public Climate-related  Disclosures), using data terms defined by the Climate Risk Sprint (see above).  The NCUA,  as a member of the TFOR should also incorporate such changes into its call report for  credit unions.  As noted in FSOC Recommendation 3.7, such information collection should  consider an institution’s size, complexity, and activities. 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       27  7. Amend the UBPR  The Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) is an invaluable tool for examiners to  assess a bank’s financial condition and risks and to compare an institution with its peers.   The UBPR, as a publicly accessible report, is also widely used by industry to conduct a  peer analysis.  The data from the UBPR comes directly from the Call Report.  Following any  amendments to the Call Report, the Task Force on Surveillance Systems (TFSS) should  create standardized measurements of climate risk in the UBPR.  Such metrics should be  able to identify risks at individual institutions as well as risks among peer groups and in the  aggregate.  This recommendation is consistent with FSOC recommendations 2.5 (Data  metrics and standardization) and 3.3 (Enhancing Public Climate-related Disclosures).  8. Host a webinar(s) for industry on risks associated with climate    Over the years, the FFIEC and its member agencies have held numerous webinars and  conferences for industry on various risk topics, including cybersecurity, Bank Secrecy  Act/ Anti-money Laundering (BSA/AML) and the LIBOR transition.  The FFIEC should host  one or more webinars for banks and credit unions on the risks of climate to financial  institutions of all sizes and the need to measure and mitigate climate risks.  9. Develop a Climate Risk Assessment Tool   Following the creation of the CCIWG, the FFIEC released the first version of the CAT.  The  CAT was a unique development by the agencies; rather than releasing a regulation or  regulatory guidance and expecting institutions to comply on their own, the FFIEC  developed a tool to help financial institutions to understand and assess their  cybersecurity risk and preparedness.  This was particularly helpful to smaller financial  institutions that lack the resources to conduct such an analysis internally.  Similarly, the FFIEC’s Climate Risk Working Group should develop a Climate Risk  Assessment Tool to help financial institutions, particularly smaller, community financial  institutions, be able to identify their risks associated with climate change as well as their  preparedness under various climate scenarios.  By clarifying expectations, FFIEC  members will address FSOC Recommendation 4.8 (Review of supervisory and regulatory  tools).  Ideally, the Tool would be based on accepted national or international standards 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       28  and would provide financial institution management with actionable steps to mitigate  risks.  10. Include climate risk as a topic in the FFIEC “Supervisory Updates and Emerging  Issues” conference for examiners  The FFIEC provides specialized education and training for examiners from the agencies.   One such offering is the Supervisory Updates and Emerging Issues Conference.  The  conference provides experienced examiners with training on developments in the  financial services industry, including new products, new technologies, and emerging risks  and other issues.  The FFIEC should include climate risk as a topic in its emerging issues  conference to update examiners on this risk to the financial services industry and the  measures being taken by both regulators and banks and credit unions to mitigate such  risks.  11. Use the upcoming modernized CRA proposed rules to Address the  Disproportionate Impact of Climate Change on Low and Moderate Income  Communities  The FSOC report on climate-related financial risk explicitly recognizes that “climate  change disproportionately affects financially vulnerable populations potentially including  lower-income communities, communities of color, Native American communities, and  other disadvantaged or underserved communities.”  Noting that while vulnerable  communities may be more exposed to climate-related risks, there’s also a recognition  that actions to address such risk, such as through higher insurance and credit costs, may  disproportionately impact financially vulnerable communities. The report calls for  thoughtful and balanced policy responses.   The interagency efforts underway to modernize the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)  rules provide an opportunity for a thoughtful and balanced policy response.  There are  myriad ways in which the forthcoming proposed CRA rules could address the impact of  climate change on low and moderate-income communities and communities of color.   Ceres submitted two CRA-related comment letters.2 These include several specific  recommendations for your consideration with the upcoming updates of CRA.  12. Update the Shared National Credit Program to account for climate-related risks 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       29  The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program assesses credit risks and trends as well as the  risk management practices associated with the largest and most complex credits shared  by multiple regulated financial institutions.  The SNC Program is conducted by the FRB, the  OCC, and the FDIC for credits involving three or more regulated institutions for aggregate  credit commitments of $100 million or more.  The most recent SNC Report highlighted the  high and increasing risk of leveraged loans as well as the industries most impacted by  COVID-19 in the pool of SNC loans.  The industries most impacted were oil and gas,  entertainment and recreation, and transportation services.  Given the size and impact of SNCs, the three federal prudential regulators should update  the SNC review process to account for climate-related risks.  While some SNC  commitments could be vulnerable to severe weather events, other SNC commitments to  industries that are highly dependent on fossil fuels may be affected by transition risk.  To  the extent that there are trends associated with climate-related risk, the agencies should  highlight those in the SNC Program report.  13. Urge the White House to designate a “Climate Risk Awareness Month/Week/Day”  at the federal level  There are commemorative designations for each month, week, and day of the year to raise  awareness of issues.  September is National Preparedness Month; October is  Cybersecurity Awareness Month.  The federal government should designate a month (or  week or day) to climate risks, including risks to the financial system.  Congress can do so  by enacting legislation but the White House can also provide for commemorative  designations by proclamation.3  Dedicating a month or week to the risks posed to the  financial and other industry sectors from climate change would help raise awareness of  such risks beyond the environmental toll.  Once designated, the financial regulators  should promote the date(s) to help raise awareness.

Interagency Coordination on Y2K    Overview of Process    Financial regulators began preparing for the Year 2000 date change (Y2K) as early as June  1996, when the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) issued an  interagency joint statement concerning the potential effect of year 2000 on computer  systems.4,5 To address potential challenges raised by Y2K, the regulators promulgated  guidance and implemented regulations over a four-year period between 1996 and 1999.     According to a statement in September 1999 from then-Comptroller of the Currency John  D. Hawke, Jr., the effort consisted of the following actions6:    First, we rigorously studied the likely impact of Y2K on the banking system  and we calculated what it would take to prepare for it. Second, we looked at  our own internal systems and earmarked the necessary resources to bring  them to a state of readiness. Third -- and perhaps most important -- we  began working with the financial institutions we supervise to heighten their  awareness and encourage them to move with all due haste toward Y2K  solutions of their own. We encouraged, we supported, and we cajoled.  Through the FFIEC, we issued more than 20 interagency policy statements,  dealing with such things as testing, contingency planning, customer  awareness, and more. We even took enforcement actions in those cases  where it seemed warranted.     Leading up to the year 2000, bank examiners conducted Y2K-related examinations  multiple times - between two and four times for each insured financial institution - and  continued to oversee the largest banks. By September 1999, 99.7 percent of all federally  supervised financial institutions had finished renovating and testing their systems -- “not 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       31  just the systems that house their records and run their elevators, but the systems that  bank customers rely upon for access to their funds.”7     The FFIEC agencies also developed educational content such as videos and brochures for  financial institutions to use in communicating to their customers the measures taken to  ensure customer funds were safe.8    Comptroller Hawke detailed the steps the FFIEC had taken to Congress in April 1999 and  said the interagency coordination consisted of9:       ● Developing and disseminating detailed policy guidance to supervised institutions;   ● Training and deploying examiners to conduct three or more onsite examinations of  each institution;   ● Setting up systems to track and monitor progress;   ● Establishing and implementing vigorous enforcement programs to deal with  deficiencies;   ● Coordinating with other government agencies as well as private enterprises,  domestically and internationally, to share valuable Year 2000-related information;   ● Conducting numerous outreach programs to educate banks and the public; and   ● Helping to organize and participating in a series of interagency contingency  planning groups to plan for the orderly resolution of problems or issues that may  arise either systemically or with individual banks.    The FFIEC published guidance documents on the following topics and published an  interim rule, which became final one year later, on Y2K-related safety and soundness  standards for financial institutions.    Guidance:  ● The Effect of Year 2000 on Computer Systems (June 1996);  ● Year 2000 Project Management Awareness (May 5, 1997);  ● Safety and Soundness Guidelines Concerning the Year 2000 Business Risk  (December 17, 1997);

Deep Dive into Interagency Action on Y2K    On June 17, 1996, the FFIEC issued its first interagency joint statement on the potential  effect of Y2K on computer systems to the CEOs of all federally supervised financial  institutions, senior management of each FFIEC agency, and all examining personnel.10 The  joint statement cautioned that the two digit field ""00"" in the year 2000 that would replace  “99” in records would be recognized as the year 1900, which would create erroneous data  or cause a system failure based on incorrect calculations. The potential impact of Y2K  could have affected “all forms of financial accounting (including interest computation, due  dates, pensions, personnel benefits, investments, legal commitments)”  and “record  keeping, such as inventory, maintenance, and file retention.”    The joint statement urged examinations to “review all aspects of computer systems to  include those provided by service bureaus, hardware vendors, and other software  vendors.” It stated that management must ensure:     ● External vendors and servicers are addressing adequately the system and  software issues related to Y2K; and 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       33  ● In the event external vendors are unable to achieve the requirements, institutions  have taken the steps needed to continue critical operations.     The joint statement also outlined the following plan for financial institutions to mitigate  Y2K-related risk:    I. Establish a Year 2000 Team   A. Management should consider utilizing both internal and external  information systems and audit resources to ensure that a risk-based  Year 2000 Action Plan is developed.   B. An inventory of all computer operating systems, applications and files  should be created. All those with year 2000 issues must be identified.     II. Develop an Institution Wide Year 2000 Plan  A. The initial step in developing the plan should be to consider whether  current systems and files should be modified, replaced, outsourced, or  discontinued. It should be noted that even if new systems are  purchased, old files may still have to be modified. (All computer systems,  including mainframes, personal computers, local area networks, etc.,  should be considered).   B. The year 2000 plan should also identify and prioritize applications and  processes that are the most date sensitive and those which are most  vulnerable. Interdependent applications should be grouped together.   C. Management and the board of directors need to ensure that adequate  funds and resources are allocated so that all year 2000 projects are  completed in a timely manner.     III. Year 2000 Plan Implementation  A. Initiate pilot projects to test solutions to identified problems. It may be  feasible to work with more than one vendor in order to evaluate their  various solutions/capabilities before making a final decision.   B. Begin the process of systematically implementing year 2000 changes  by priority in accordance to risk. These projects should be conducted 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       34  within the framework of the system development life cycle process  currently in place.   C. Conduct post implementation reviews to ensure the integrity and  functionality of the modified systems.     Interagency communications developed through the FFIEC were transmitted through the  federal regulators to examiners and the financial institutions they supervised. The OCC  relied on advisory letters to transmit the information, the Fed, FDIC, and Office of Thrift  Supervision (OTS) used press releases, and the NCUA used letters to supervised  institutions to relay the information.   On May 5, 1997, the FFIEC issued a second statement that set out a project management  process strongly encouraging federally insured depository institutions to complete an  inventory of core computer functions and outline priorities for Y2K goals by September 30,  1997. The statement provides that the “five management phases necessary to complete a  computer conversion program are: awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and  implementation.” Banks were expected to largely complete programming changes and  have testing underway for mission critical systems by December 31, 1998.    The statement included in an appendix a questionnaire from the FFIEC Task Force on  Supervision to help regulatory agencies conduct assessments of financial institutions’  planning efforts.11 Regulators used the results of these assessments to determine which  supervisory reviews to prioritize based on examination procedures included in a second  appendix to the statement. Conversion efforts were expected to be completed by mid- 1998.    In 1998, the FFIEC agencies also began supervising for Y2K-related risk for service  providers and vendors in examinations, and they included risk analysis on a quarterly  basis.12     In February 1998, the OTS began publishing a monthly newsletter for the agency’s 750  examiners and 1200 thrift institutions it supervised.13 Content included summaries of its 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       35  findings from off-site examinations related to Y2K and the key OTS staff contacts for Y2K- related matters.   In May and October 1998, the FFIEC hosted seminars for risk management planning that  included as agenda items managing the risks of emerging technologies and Y2K  concerns.14  On August 31, 1998, the FFIEC issued the first of three FAQs and answers (the FAQs)  regarding Y2K.15 The FAQs focused on testing, documentation, and the FFIEC report  distribution process. They also covered the following topics:   ● Clarification of FFIEC policy concerning the types of testing documentation that  financial institutions should retain;  ● Expectations regarding software and operating system upgrades in 1999;   ● Conversions to new mission-critical systems in 1999; and   ● Procedures for regulators to examine service providers and software vendors.    On October 15, 1998, the FFIEC agencies published joint interim guidelines to adopt Y2K  safety and soundness standards. The guidelines were implemented as a final rule the  following year on November 29, 1999 with minimal changes.16 The standards focused on  the following topics:     ● Review of mission-critical systems for Year 2000 readiness;  ● Renovation of internal mission-critical systems;  ● Renovation of external mission-critical systems;  ● Testing of mission-critical systems;  ● Business resumption contingency planning;  ● Remediation contingency planning;  ● Customer risk; and  ● Involvement of the board of directors and management.    On December 11, 1998, the FFIEC published its second FAQ resource regarding contingency  planning that supplemented the previous FAQs and clarified expectations for completing  remediation and business resumption contingency plans.17 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       36    On May 6, 1999, the FFIEC published additional answers to three Y2K FAQs regarding  contingency planning.    On July 6, 1999, the FFIEC released guidance on Y2K-related fraud prevention.18 The  guidance encouraged institutions to enhance internal controls and security procedures  and to communicate with customers about how to protect against Y2K-related fraudulent  schemes. It also issued a consumer advisory for financial institutions’ customers  regarding Y2k-related fraud.  On June 9, 1999, the FDIC adopted an interim final rule that required certain FDIC-insured  banks to implement asset and liability backup programs so that financial records would  be preserved in case it suffered a Y2K-related problem and had to be placed in  receivership.19 The rule applied to FDIC-insured banks that scored less than “satisfactory”  in their Y2K ratings on or after July 31, 1999.   Following the transition from 1999 to 2000, the FFIEC published on March 21, 2000, a  document detailing the lessons learned from its Y2K-related  preparation.     The FFIEC stated that it believed the institutions that were best prepared possessed most  or all of the following 10 characteristics:  ● Senior management and director involvement to ensure that the project plans  were clearly defined, supported and monitored;  ● Consolidation, elimination or integration of technology on an enterprise-wide basis  by developing current inventories of information technology systems and  applications;  ● Improved oversight of service providers, software vendors and consultants;  ● More formalized and effective strategies and standards for testing information  technology systems;  ● Detailed contingency plans that analyzed the effect of potential system failures on  core business processes (e.g., deposit taking, lending, fiduciary services, etc.);  ● Better safeguards to detect fraudulent, malicious, and negligent acts from both  internal and external sources;  ● Review of testing and contingency planning processes by internal auditors;

II.  Cybersecurity Assessment Tool  The FFIEC developed its risk assessment tool for cyber risk less than one year after  recognizing cybersecurity as a priority.  When he assumed the chairmanship of the FFIEC,  Comptroller Curry announced cybersecurity as his top priority.       On June 24, 2014, the FFIEC launched a dedicated page on cybersecurity to serve as a  resource for financial institutions and examiners. The FFIEC stated20:    While information security has been a core focus of supervision for decades,  the FFIEC members are taking a number of steps to raise awareness of  cybersecurity risks at financial institutions and the need to identify, assess,  and mitigate these risks in light of the increasing volume and sophistication  of cyber threats that pose risks to all industries in our society. The FFIEC  Web page provides links to joint statements, webinars, and other  information that may help financial institutions when thinking about the  issue of cybersecurity.    It also launched a pilot program at over 500 community institutions to enable state and  federal regulators to assess how the community institutions manage cybersecurity and  mitigate cyber risks. In their assessments, regulators focused on: risk management and  oversight; threat intelligence and collaboration; cybersecurity controls; service provider  and vendor risk management; and cyber incident management and resilience. The pilot  also served to help regulators enhance  supervisory programs’ effectiveness, guidance,  and examiner training.   
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       38  Within four months, on November 3, 2014, the FFIEC published general observations from  its cybersecurity assessment pilot, including findings regarding inherent risks of  cybersecurity and institution preparedness.21     Following the publication of its observations from its cybersecurity pilot, the FFIEC  outlined its cybersecurity priorities for the remainder of 2015 on March 17, 2015.22 The  priorities included establishing seven workstreams, including a workstream on developing  and issuing a self-assessment tool for financial institutions to use in evaluating their  cybersecurity preparedness and respond to cyber threats. The seven workstreams  focused on the following topics23:    ● Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Tool—The FFIEC plans to issue a self- assessment tool this year to assist institutions in evaluating their  inherent cybersecurity risk and their risk management capabilities.  ● Incident Analysis—FFIEC members will enhance their processes for  gathering, analyzing, and sharing information with each other during  cyber incidents.  ● Crisis Management—The FFIEC will align, update, and test  emergency protocols to respond to system-wide cyber incidents in  coordination with public-private partnerships.  ● Training—The FFIEC will develop training programs for the staff of its  members on evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities.  ● Policy Development—The FFIEC will update and supplement its  Information Technology Examination Handbook to reflect rapidly  evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities with a focus on risk  management and oversight, threat intelligence and collaboration,  cybersecurity controls, external dependency management, and  incident management and resilience.  ● Technology Service Provider Strategy—The FFIEC’s members will  expand their focus on technology service providers’ ability to  respond to growing cyber threats and vulnerabilities.  ● Collaboration with Law Enforcement and Intelligence Agencies—The  FFIEC will build upon existing relationships with law enforcement and 
      Ceres Headquarters: 99 Chauncy Street, Boston, MA 02111                   ceres.org  California Office: 369 Pine Street, Suite 620, San Francisco, CA 94104       39  intelligence agencies to share information on the growing  cybersecurity threats and response techniques.  Shortly after, on June 30, 2015, the FFIEC released its Cybersecurity Assessment Tool  (CAT)24 to help institutions identify risks and assess cybersecurity readiness.25 The CAT  was intended for use by financial institutions of all sizes and was designed to be dynamic  so that it could be updated as threats, vulnerabilities, and operational environments  became more sophisticated. It also served to help examiners in their assessments of  cyber risk. The FFIEC published resources to encourage use of the CAT such as “an  executive overview, a user’s guide, an online presentation explaining the Assessment, and  appendices mapping the Assessment’s baseline maturity statements to the FFIEC  Information Technology Examination Handbook, mapping all maturity statements to the  National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework, and providing  a glossary of terms.”26    On October  26, 2016, the federal banking regulators - OCC, Fed, and FDIC - published an  advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to enhance cyber risk management  standards for large and interconnected entities under their supervision and  the entities’  service providers.27 The ANPR covered the following topics: cyber risk governance; cyber  risk management; internal dependency management; external dependency  management; and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness.     Meanwhile, the FFIEC updated the CAT in 2017 to address changes to the FFIEC IT  Examination Handbook and provide additional response options and practices and  processes that represented the practices of the institution in supporting its cybersecurity  activity assessment.28    The ANPR has not yet come to fruition as a proposed or final rule, however, in March 2020,  the Fed was expecting further action on the enhanced standards.29","Ceres, a nonprofit organization focused on climate change, submitted comments on the FDIC's Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions. Ceres commends the FDIC for its efforts and suggests that climate-related financial risks should be considered by all banks, not just those with over $100 billion in assets. They argue that climate change poses systemic financial risks similar to cybersecurity and pandemics, affecting banks of all sizes. Ceres recommends the FDIC lower the asset threshold to $50 billion, as these institutions already manage significant risks. They suggest the FDIC develop a climate risk assessment tool similar to the FFIEC's Cybersecurity Assessment Tool and tailor guidance for smaller institutions. Ceres also emphasizes the importance of consistent interagency guidance to avoid regulatory inconsistency and reduce compliance costs. They advocate for mandatory regulations rather than voluntary guidelines and stress the need for banks to incorporate climate risks into their risk management frameworks. Ceres highlights the challenges banks face in obtaining climate data and suggests that the FDIC provide clear guidance on materiality assessments and scenario analysis. They also recommend that the FDIC consider the impacts of climate-related risks on disadvantaged communities."

Gruenberg  Acting Chairman  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street, NW  Washington, DC 20429      Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for    Large Financial Institutions (RN 3064-ZA32)      Dear Acting Chairman Gruenberg:    On behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), we are pleased to  submit these comments on the draft Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC). NRDC is an international nonprofit environmental organization  with more than 3 million members and online activists. Since 1970, our lawyers,  scientists, and other environmental specialists have worked to protect the world’s  natural resources, public health, and environment. NRDC has offices in New York City,  Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Montana, and Beijing.  Through  its finance and legal experts, NRDC remains engaged in financial  regulation and views sensible financial regulation as an integral part of mitigating  climate change.     We appreciate the FDIC’s leadership on this important first step to integrate  climate-related financial risk into its prudential supervision of large banks. Climate  change presents a serious threat to individual banks and to the financial system. Banks  should be encouraged to identify and mitigate climate-related financial risk and  supervisory guidance from the FDIC will ensure that banks will rigorously undertake  these efforts.   The Introduction section of the Principles cogently describes the emerging threat  to individual financial institutions and to the financial system posed by climate change,  both from physical risk and from transition risk. We therefore proceed directly to  addressing some of the questions posed by the RFI.     Questions 1, 2, and 3: Additional factors, for example, size, location, and  business model, that should inform institutions’ adoption of principles; how could  future guidance assist a financial institution in adopting risk management practices 
commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations; and what  challenges do institutions face in so adopting and how can the FDIC help?     The Principles are directed at financial institutions with over $100 billion in total  consolidated assets.  Ultimately, as the FDIC appears to recognize, guidance must be  developed to apply to virtually all institutions; the FDIC supervises and examines about  5,000 banks and savings associations. However, the requirements will presumably be  tailored to take into account the institution’s size as well as other considerations.  We understand why the FDIC might choose, as a first step, to address the  guidance only to the largest institutions. These larger institutions have more internal  resources to develop the robust governance and operational procedures necessary to  address climate-related financial risk, as well as purchase the data needed to fully  consider the risk to their portfolios. But it is important that the FDIC follow up  promptly with a timeframe and then the actual issuance of guidance for smaller banks,  appropriately tailored to their situations. The Principles put smaller banks on notice that  climate risk guidance applicable to them will be forthcoming. A more specific  timeframe for complying with such guidance will assist smaller banks in beginning  internal preparations for compliance and the actual issuance of tailored guidance will  allow them to complete their preparations. It is not too soon to start thinking about the  guidance that would apply to smaller institutions. There are two factors that stand out  when considering how to craft guidance for the smaller institutions.  First, their risk profile may be very different from that of larger institutions. They  may have far greater concentration risk, including industry and geographic  concentrations. For example, a large percentage of their loan portfolio might consist of  loans to farmers with outsize drought risk, to coastal property owners with worsening  hurricane and flooding exposure, or to fossil fuel businesses jeopardized by transition  risk.  From an institutional safety and soundness perspective, it is important to  identify these concentration risks. Portfolio diversification may be difficult without  impairing the institution’s mission of serving the local community. This issue may be  particularly acute for low-to-moderate (LMI) or disadvantaged communities. The  second difference is that smaller institutions will tend to have fewer internal resources  to address climate-related financial risk. They have a smaller portfolio over which to  spread fixed costs such as hiring personnel to deal with climate issues.    Question 8: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies—for  example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments—do 
financial institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial  risks?    NRDC agrees that banks can use insurance and derivatives to mitigate climate- related financial risks, but there is a danger of solely relying on such measures to  mitigate these risks.   Banks require insurance coverage to mitigate potential losses due to any loss  event, including climate disasters. However, risks from both the insured and/or the  insurer could revert the climate-related risks to the banks themselves.   Borrowers are required to provide proof of insurance coverage for loan closing  purposes. However, as regions prone to climate change effects are subject to increased  risk pricing, higher premiums (or worse, the discontinuation of coverage) can lead to a  lapse in coverage for borrowers in these areas. These lapses in coverage can be  overlooked due to the loose enforcement of maintaining the required coverage.   Counterparty risk could also swell during climate disasters as the insurers  themselves are highly susceptible to climate-related risks. Many insurers invest their  assets in investments vulnerable to climate disasters or transition risk. Climate events  could drain the liquidity of asset pools used for payouts. Moreover, improperly  assessed climate risks can lead to insufficient payouts as risk assessment maps of  disaster-prone regions are not up to date.    Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of  climate-related financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on  households and communities, specifically LMI and other disadvantaged  communities? Should the agencies modify existing regulations and guidance, such as  those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act, to address the impact  climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged  communities?    NRDC agrees that banks must be encouraged to consider the fair lending  implications of their climate risk strategies. As outlined below, there is a real danger  that the adoption of enhanced climate risk mitigation measures by banks may result in  disproportionate treatment of or impact to climate-burdened communities, including  lower-income communities and communities of color. We urge FDIC to consider  additional regulatory actions to address likely impacts on disadvantaged communities. 
Fair lending laws prohibit banks from engaging in discriminatory lending  practices.1   There are two categories of discriminatory practices for fair lending  purposes. Disparate treatment occurs when a lender treats a borrower differently based  on a proscribed characteristic, such as race or sex. Disparate impact occurs when a  facially neutral policy or practice disproportionately burdens a protected class of  persons.2  If a disparate impact exists, the lender must show that the policy or practice is  justified by “business necessity.” Even if a business necessity exists, however, the lender  may be liable if there are alternative policies that serve the same purpose with less  discriminatory effect.3   Fair lending risk is especially acute where risks are distributed unevenly among  potential borrowers in a manner that aligns with one or more protected characteristics,  such as race. Climate change fits squarely within this category. A substantial and  growing literature demonstrates that many climate-related risks, such as the risk of  weather-induced disaster or sea level rise, may be disproportionately borne by lower  income communities and communities of color.4  A November 2021 Staff Report by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveyed this literature and concluded that “regions  of the United States that are home to above-average shares of low-income and minority  groups are likely to suffer the greatest meteorological effects of climate change.”5  The  report also found that “low-income and minority Americans are limited in how they  may adapt to climate change because they have less access to insurance and are less  likely to have access to credit when needed.”6   The close correlation between climate and race (among other factors) raises the  possibility that bank policies and practices intended to mitigate climate risk may create  fair lending liability through disparate treatment of or disparate impacts on borrowers  of color. Moreover, even where bank practices do not give rise to legal liability under  fair lending laws, they may unreasonably restrict access to financial services within  climate-burdened communities.     1 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a); 42 U.S.C. § 3605(a).

Of particular concern are risk mitigation measures that force individual  households and small businesses to internalize climate-related risks. Such measures  may significantly restrict access to credit within already-disadvantaged communities,  further reducing their capacity to respond to climate-related challenges such as  weather-related disasters or sea level rise. Such measures may also expose lenders to  fair lending risk under the disparate impact standard if a less-discriminatory alternative  exists. For this reason, NRDC recommends that banks avoid adopting policies that seek  to mitigate climate risk by restricting access to credit for individual low-income and  minority households and small businesses.  To ensure compliance with fair lending obligations and promote fair access to  financial services, NRDC recommends that FDIC’s guidance document incorporate the  following principles:   • Banks should carefully and holistically assess their climate risk management policies and  practices for potential disparate treatment or impact on the basis of race or other protected  classes.   • Banks should collect sufficient data on lending in climate-burdened communities to  understand whether their lending practices result in discriminatory treatment or impact.  The data should be disclosed to FDIC and closely monitored on an ongoing basis for fair  lending risk. In addition, banks should ensure that all data and models relied upon to  assess climate-related risk do not include built-in biases.  • Banks should provide fair lending training to all staff involved in assessing climate risk  for lending purposes.  The guidance should make clear that FDIC will closely scrutinize banks’ climate risk  management practices in accordance with the above principles.  In addition, NRDC strongly encourages FDIC to consider additional regulatory  actions to ensure fair access to financial services within climate-burdened communities,  such as updating official supervisory materials to include climate-related fair lending  guidance, such as the Consumer Compliance Examination Manual; encouraging banks  to meet Community Reinvestment Act requirements through investment in climate  adaptation measures in at-risk communities; and/or issuing further guidance or  regulation on fair lending and climate. FDIC should also coordinate closely with FSOC  and other relevant federal agencies (such as FEMA and HUD) to ensure that regulatory  changes in the financial sector do not inhibit whole-of-government efforts to ensure an  equitable climate transition.    Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and  models from borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to  identify, measure, monitor, and control their own climate-related financial risks? 
How do financial institutions currently obtain this information? What gaps and other  concerns are there with respect to these data, metrics, tools or models?    We recommend that the FDIC ask banks to obtain a complete picture of climate  risk for significant borrowers and counterparties. The data providing such a complete  picture has three key components: Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions,  geolocation information for significant infrastructure, and any climate or sustainability  disclosures made by the borrower or counterparty.   Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions tell banks about a borrower or  counterparty’s contribution to climate change and their vulnerability to transition risk  in an orderly or disorderly move to a low emissions economy. “Scope 1 emissions are  direct [greenhouse gas] emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned  by an organization. . . . Scope 2 emissions are indirect [greenhouse gas] emissions  associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling.” Scope 3 emissions  are everything else: “the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the  reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain. . ..  Scope 3 emissions, also referred to as value chain emissions, often represent the  majority of an organization’s total GHG emissions.”7  The volume and trend of  greenhouse gas emissions informs a bank’s picture of how a borrower or counterparty  is managing transition risk.   To gauge physical risk, banks should also obtain geolocational information for  key infrastructure from borrowers. This would certainly include any collateralized  infrastructure, but also information on any infrastructure that underpins significant  operations. If, for example, a borrower has significant property on a coastline  vulnerable to tidal flooding and extreme weather, that information ought to inform a  bank’s risk analysis.   Finally, banks should obtain borrower or counterparty disclosures under any  climate or sustainability disclosure framework. Some of this information would be  duplicative of the greenhouse gas emissions and physical risk inventory discussed  above, but disclosure frameworks also call for information about board oversight of  climate risks, internal processes for identifying and managing climate risk, and  projected financial impacts of climate risk.      7 EPA.gov, “GHG Inventory Development Process and Guidance,” https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/ghg- inventory-development-process-and-guidance. 
Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be  augmented to better capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related  financial risks?    In addition to the scenario analysis guidance discussed below, we recommend  that the FDIC have banks report on their financed emissions, which is the volume of  greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the bank’s lending portfolio. The Partnership  for Carbon Accounting Financials has developed guidance to assist financial institutions  with calculating their financed emissions, including guidance about how to estimate the  percentage of emissions from an activity attributable to the bank’s financing.8  As with  knowing a borrower’s footprint of greenhouse gas emissions, a bank’s financed  emissions footprint and its trajectory over time helps regulators assess the bank’s  vulnerability to transition risk.    Question 13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk  management that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world.  How do financial institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and  what challenges do they face?    We agree that scenario analysis is an important climate risk management tool,  and we believe it is one that all banks should be using to evaluate their climate risk and  take appropriate steps to mitigate that risk. While banks seem to agree that scenario  analysis is important, a recent study suggests that fewer than 10 percent of all financial  institutions are using it,9 and small banks are less likely to have incorporated scenario  analysis into their climate risk management plans.   Obtaining reliable information about borrowers’ climate risks is a problem for all  banks (indeed, obtaining reliable information about companies’ climate risk is a general  problem for regulators and stakeholders). For small banks that do not lend to public  companies, it is an even greater challenge. The FDIC can advance banks’ use of scenario    8 PCAF, “The Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry,”  https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/standard#the-global-ghg-accounting-and-reporting-standard-for-the- financial-industry.  9 Cadwalader, Climate Risk Study Finds Advances in Financial Industry  Mitigation Strategies; Concerns Linger on Execution (Feb. 4, 2022).  
analysis by providing supervisory guidance on its role in risk management and the  appropriate scenarios for banks to use in scenario analysis.    Question 14: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when  designing and executing scenario analysis exercises?    We strongly support the inclusion of scenario analysis for understanding the  risks banks face. Past risks from extreme weather will not be a reliable predictor of  climate risk, so banks will need to use models that consider that future risk. Thus, any  guidance from the FDIC on scenario analysis should emphasize the importance of using  models that align with the latest climate science and that assume a range of global  average temperature increases, including worst case scenarios. And to model transition  risk, scenario analyses should include orderly and disorderly transitions to a low  carbon economy.   We encourage the FDIC to use its supervisory guidance authority to ensure that  all banks eventually use scenario analysis in their climate risk evaluations, and to  eventually incorporate climate stress testing into its examinations. The FDIC’s use of its  supervisory authority can ensure that climate risk is consistently modeled, evaluated,  and mitigated by banks of all sizes.   ***  We thank the FDIC for its consideration of our comments.

2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-050,"June 3, 2022    James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429.   Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions  Dear Executive Assistant Sheesley,    On behalf of the Center for Human Rights and Environment (CHRE),1 I would like to thank you and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for seeking public commentary to contribute to a high-level  framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks.2     There has never been a more important time to tackle this challenge. The latest climate science is warning  us that global temperature increases are likely to exceed 1.5°C (as compared to pre-industrial times) during  the 2030s, and 2°C by mid-century, unless we can rapidly reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. This  imminent breach of global warming beyond 1.5°C is extremely dangerous because surpassing this guardrail  established by the Paris Agreement could lead to breaching irreversible climate tipping points, after which  we would not only face more intense and much more severe climate impacts, but even more tragically, we  would no longer be able to fix the climate crisis. Unfortunately, current global efforts to tackle climate  change put the world on track for about 3.2°C of warming by 2100.3 An urgent change of course on climate  must be our top priority, as every 1/10 of a degree of warming translates to intense increases of climate  impacts and to the deepened deterioration of our ecosystems.4     The FDIC draft Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions could be significantly strengthened by more adequately contextualizing climate risk  assessment and disclosure rules in terms of the short-term urgency of the climate crisis measuring risk  according to how effectively society is taking the necessary steps to avoid imminent climate catastrophe.  Climate risk assessment and related disclosure rules are currently mostly set in a long term scenario (mid  to late century) and they are generally carbon-centric, a framework that is proving insufficient to adequately  understand our immediate climate emergency. The benefits of decarbonization will not be reaped for  centuries to millennia, whereas irreversible climate tipping points are only a few decades or even a handful  of years away. Effectively reducing climate risk is only possible through achieving short-term aggressive  reductions of the most intense climate super pollutants, including methane, black carbon, HFCs, and  tropospheric ozone, which are tens, hundreds and even thousands of times more potent than CO2 in terms  of their climate-forcing impact, helping us cut the rate of global warming in half in the near term, giving  the world a fighting chance to avoid imminent climate collapse for present and for future generations.5     With this in mind, the following are four key messages we would like to convey to the FDIC:    1. The FDIC must incorporate a Fast Climate Mitigation approach to climate risk assessment  policy and disclosure rules. The climate emergency is deepening faster than previously thought.  Society must reduce the most polluting greenhouse gases between now and 20306 (and not 2100 or  2050 as previously thought) to avoid catastrophic climate impacts and surpassing irreversible  climate tipping points that will permanently destabilize global economies, augmenting financial  and operational uncertainties and disruptions.7 Climate risk assessment and related climate  disclosure rules must conform to this short-term urgency with a short term risk horizon (2030)  while concurrently evaluating whether the most effective and immediate emissions reductions  strategies available are being employed to rapidly slow global warming.  
  2. Evaluation of climate risk and disclosure rules must assess and steer the disclosure of  information to reveal to what degree climate strategies in place and related risk are evaluated  beyond decarbonization strategies and focus on the most aggressive pollutants in the short  term. Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2), while necessary over the long term (by mid to end of century  and beyond), is not sufficient to keep global warming to 1.5°C. Climate risk assessment and  disclosure rules must help us evaluate and predict to what extent society is promoting strategies  and actions that reduce the most aggressive climate pollutants (in addition to reducing CO2) such  as methane (CH4), black carbon, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and tropospheric ozone (O3), which  have many times the climate-forcing impact as CO2 and can help avoid up to 0.6 °C of warming by  2050, greatly reducing financial risks related to climate.8 Targeting super pollutant reductions also  provides immediate local health benefits to the most climate-vulnerable communities.9   3. The FDIC should encourage financial institutions to themselves contribute to climate  solutions and not be part of the problem. The current draft Statement of Principles centers on  assessing the risk of financial investments that could be harmed by climate change but fails to  consider the significant impacts (and subsequently the increased risk) of financial investments  themselves on the climate. The FDIC should help steer financial institutions to be themselves part  of the solution to our climate emergency. While many companies make significant efforts to reduce  their GHG emissions and put aggressive climate policies into place (thereby reducing climate risk),  the financial institutions that hold their deposits may in fact be working at odds with the climate,  and through investments, be supporting industries that are the worst polluters (aggravating climate  risk).10 This needs to end and FDIC can help steer a more climate-sustainable pathway for the  financial sector.   4. The FDIC must incorporate an Environmental Justice dimension into its climate risk  assessment policy and disclosure rules. Climate change disproportionately impacts  disadvantaged communities.11 Without explicitly addressing environmental justice concerns in  climate risk assessment or in disclosure rules, responses to climate change could be impaired by,  and exacerbate, the lack of strategies to adequately address the climate emergency and persistent  environmental and climate injustices faced by the most climate vulnerable.12 Intergenerational  climate equity considerations must also be considered in assessing present risk as compared to  future generation risk of current policies and trends.13 Climate policy can and should work in  tandem with social equity policies and climate risk assessment and financial disclosures hence must  also be considered in the context of social or climate equity dimensions and risks. The current draft  rule is mostly lacking on environmental justice dimensions and could be greatly improved.      The FDIC has important leverage on many of our economy’s largest financial institutions – namely those  of a magnitude large enough to reduce global GHG emissions by considerable amounts on their own14 or  through their investments. The FDIC and the financial institutions that it regulates also have considerable  influence on global markets. The FDIC has the unique opportunity to help steer the financial sector in the  United States, and globally, towards adopting climate risk assessment tools and disclosure rules that can  help steer climate policies, management practices, monitoring, and reporting to truly make an important  contribution to an effective and decisive response to our escalating climate emergency and help keep us on  the 1.5°C of warming pathway that climate scientists are warning us we should not breach.     We applaud the FDIC’s effort to consider taking on this challenge and are at your service to help in any  way we can to guide this rule-setting process.     Respectfully,     Jorge Daniel Taillant15  Executive Director  Center for Human Rights and Environment 
  The science behind why faster action on climate is paramount and why super pollutants are the  leverage point for avoiding irreversible climate impacts.   Leading scientists—including those gathered through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC)—have concluded in their latest reports that we are losing the race to stop climate change. The world  is heating up too fast and it will soon surpass irreversible climate tipping points, beyond which there will  be no solutions left to stop global warming and its most devastating impacts. The Paris Agreement had set  a limit to global warming levels, 1.5°C (2.7°F) of warming as compared to pre-industrial levels.16 We’ve  already warmed the planet by 1.2°C leaving only 0.3°C left before we simply get too hot to handle.     In their efforts to stop and revert climate change, governments and the private sector are mostly centered  on developing a pathway toward decarbonization with a target date of 2050-2100 to stabilize the climate.  While we once believed this was a viable strategy, at our current rates of warming, the IPCC has indicated  that these targets will no longer be sufficient. Forecasts have been revised, and the science now demands  that certain time horizons be amended to 2030 – warning us that time is running out for climate solutions  to be put in place. The key take home message is that cutting carbon dioxide emissions alone does not help  us meet our 1.5°C of warming containment target. Fortunately, a solution is available.     In addition to decarbonizing (reducing CO2 emissions) we must cut even more polluting greenhouse gas  emissions by 2030 or it will be too late, as stated by the 2022 IPCC report.17 IPCC Working Group III co- chair Jim Skea in a statement said, “it’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F)”.18  Because CO2 is a pollutant that remains in the atmosphere for a very long time – up to hundreds or thousands  of years – even if we were to cease all CO2 emissions today, there would only be marginal benefits for the  atmosphere by 2050, or 2100. We would certainly not cool the Earth before surpassing 1.5°C. To reach the  looming short-term (2030) climate cooling targets, reducing super polluting greenhouse gases called short- lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) should be of primary concern. Methane (CH4) is one of the most important  super pollutants to focus on in the short term. With 86 times more potency as a climate polluter than CO2,  methane provides exponential benefits to the climate if emissions are reduced quickly. The great thing about  reducing methane is that we know where it is and how to reduce it quickly and cost-effectively. About half  of the world’s methane emissions are from anthropogenic causes–landfills, wastewater, agriculture, and in  the oil and gas sector. Methane is the key target for bending the warming curve in the next 10 or 20 years  while we make a more long-term effort to transition to a low- or zero-carbon economy.19 20 21 22    The landmark Global Methane Assessment demonstrates that reducing methane emissions by 45% by 2030  will avoid almost 0.3 degrees Celsius of warming globally and 0.5 degrees Celsius of warming in the  vulnerable Arctic by the 2040s23. Indeed, one message has been made clear by the United Nations  Environment Programme and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition’s Global Methane Assessment, and the  IPCC’s Sixth Assessment reports: cut methane now or doom the planet. According to the recent IPCC  reports, every added increment of climate pollution causes further irreversible harm. Record-shattering  heatwaves and floods will become more and more frequent unless we slow the rate of warming as quickly  as possible. We’re seeing self-reinforcing feedbacks start to accelerate warming and learning that we’re  closer to crossing climate tipping points than previously thought.24 25   Feedback loops and irreversible tipping points are what happens when, for example, melting glaciers or sea  ice rapidly disappear. Arctic Sea ice, for instance, acts as a “white shield” reflecting incoming solar  radiation back into space, cooling the planet.26 When this ice melts, it reveals darker earth or the darker blue  ocean underneath which then absorbs more heat than the ice’s prior white surface which was reflecting heat  back into space. As melting of this ice increases, progressively darker surfaces become exposed, causing a  self-reinforcing cycle in which sea ice coverage decreases at an increasing rate causing global warming  increases at an increasing rate.27 This is an example of what we call a feedback loop.28 29 30 Tipping points, 
  meanwhile, are climate thresholds that if breeched, could not be repaired, at least in reasonable human- relevant time periods. Glaciers, for instance, can take tens, hundreds or even thousands of years to be  regenerated. In this way, melting glaciers, particularly large ones, would be an “irreversible” climate tipping  point.31 32   Methane is just one super pollutant, however. Other very intense climate pollutants include black carbon, a  highly potent climate-warming aerosol that remains in the atmosphere for only a few days to weeks. It is a  significant climate pollutant that absorbs solar radiation and emits heat. When deposited on glaciers because  of a forest fire emitting soot into the air streams, or because of emissions from dirty combustion in engines  or in home heating and cooking, soot accelerates ice melt by darkening glacier surfaces. Black carbon (or  soot) also harms plants; and affects the microphysical properties of clouds by perturbing precipitation  patterns. It also is very harmful to human health – contributing to respiratory problems, low birth rates,  heart attacks, and lung cancer. Overall, on a 20-year time scale, black carbon holds a global warming  potential greater than 3200 times that of carbon dioxide.   Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), meanwhile, are factory-made chemicals used in refrigeration and insulation  foams that have a warming effect thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. As the emissions of  HFCs grow by 10-15% per year, they have become a massive concern for global warming. Tropospheric  ozone, is another short-lived climate pollutant. It is the main component of smog and is a major air and  climate pollutant. It is similarly harmful for both warming and human health, making it the third most  important gas behind carbon dioxide and methane.33   As mentioned in the Principles on Governance section, the board must have an adequate understanding of  how to assess the potential impact of climate-related risks from a climate science perspective – rather than  solely a financial-risk perspective – to address and oversee these risks within the institution’s strategy and  risk appetite, including an understanding of the potential ways in which these risks could evolve over  various time horizons and scenarios. Question (7) is relevant here, because being informed by SLCPs will  help financial institutions both better avoid and adapt to climate-risks in the short-term34.     The context for FDIC engagement on Fast Climate Mitigation and Super Pollutant Strategies  The FDIC does not stand alone in its effort to advance key climate policies that can greatly curb global  warming. In an all-of-government approach to tackling climate change, the United States, along with key  global partners recently worked swiftly and collaboratively at the 2021 Climate Summit in Glasgow, to  highlight the importance of tackling climate change more aggressively to reach GHG emissions reductions  targets, earlier, by 2030. Climate change is a rapidly moving agenda and must be reflected in rapid actions  by all government agencies in a position to leverage change and effectively tackle the climate emergency  before we breech irreversible climate tipping points. The FDIC’s leadership is key to guide the financial  sector to adapt to new climate-related challenges.35 The FDIC’s role in steering the financial sector in this  direction cannot be over-stressed.  Climate change is increasingly impacting business worldwide with trillions of dollars of financial impacts.36  Climate change, deforestation, and water scarcity are likely to put $1.26 trillion of suppliers’ revenue at  risk over the next five years.37 Indeed, the Paris Agreement demonstrated that reaching 2030 targets are key  to facing the least impacts to global GDP – 4% losses are projected for 1.5°C while 11% losses are projected  for 2°C.38 Super pollutant emissions and mitigation plans are material information for understanding a  registrant’s financial position, making then directly tied to climate-related risks and adaptation costs.39 40  
  The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), charged with promoting better- informed decisions related to investment, credit, and insurance had made significant inroads to promoting  climate disclosures. The TCFD framework has become reliable for climate-related financial reporting and  has garnered a total market capitalization of 25$ trillion in support for the TCFD.41 The inevitable effects  that climate impacts have on public companies’ ability to be insured is increasing, and it is necessary that  investors are able to access disclosers on their investments likeliness to be affected by impacts like flooding  on coastal properties. For example, some insurance companies have withdrawn from wildfire-prone areas  or are retreating from climate-vulnerable regions like California42 and Florida.43   The Securities Exchange Commission has also shown resolve in advancing more effective corporate climate  policies in its Proposed Rules to Enhance and Standardize Climate-Related Disclosure to Investors.44   Nationally, Congress and the federal government have taken action to curb super pollutant emissions, and  companies must proactively prepare for this shifting legal and regulatory environment. In December 2020,  Congress passed the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act, which phases down HFCs in the  United States.45 The Senate has passed, and the House of Representatives is expected to pass, a resolution  to reinstate methane-control regulations for the oil and gas sector.46 Pursuant to President Biden’s Executive  Order 13,990, every executive agency has been directed to review existing regulations and develop  regulations that combat the climate crisis.47 Additionally, in April 2021, EPA proposed regulations to  implement the AIM Act.48 EPA also announced stakeholder meetings in anticipation of a new regulation  for methane emissions from new oil and gas sources,49 and the Office of Management and Budget requested  comments on the social costs of carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide.50  Internationally, the federal government has established stringent 2030 GHG reduction targets that include  targets for reducing super pollutants. Under the Paris Climate Agreement, the US committed to reducing  GHG (including SLCP) emissions by 50–52% below 2005 levels in 2030.51 In announcing this  commitment, the White House emphasized the importance of reducing super pollutants to keep 1.5°C  within reach.52 The US also committed to enhanced actions to reduce black carbon emissions.53  Additionally, together with energy ministries from Canada, Norway, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, the US  established the Net-Zero Producers Forum that will advance methane abatement, among other net-zero  strategies for the oil and gas sector.54   Meeting these international commitments will require action across sectors, and companies must quickly  adapt themselves to the challenges – including costs, risks, and required disclosures – that arise amid this  evolving crisis. As mentioned in the Principle on Governance section, responsibility and accountability  may be integrated within existing organizational structures or by establishing new structures for climate- related financial risks and should be informed by the emerging climate science, rather than from a purely  financial standpoint.55 Through the promotion of fast mitigation and short-lived pollutant climate-related  disclosures, the FDIC can help reduce climate risk and help investors and other stakeholders better  understand how registrants are getting ahead of or responding to the changes in the legal and regulatory  environment.   Including Environmental Justice Framework  There is increasing evidence in media and in academics of policy decisions that have been taken over many  decades to intentionally concentrate environmental pollution in minority and disadvantaged communities,  in practices known as redlining.56 Environmental discrimination of this sort has resulted in increased climate  vulnerability of minority and other disadvantaged communities, due to, for example, the lack of adequate  infrastructure to promote cooling on very hot days (such as urban tree canopy or energy efficient buildings), 
  or poor air quality due to proximity to polluting industries or polluting transit routes which concentrate  particulate matter, just to name a few.   Environmental justice dimensions of climate policy are gaining ground and policy responses to climate  change received increased investment budgets from state authorities. In parallel, corporations, including  financial institutions that have been complicit in redlining practices (and the sector as a whole more  broadly), must assume past responsibility for contributing to these inequities, but are in a particularly  important position to evaluate how their current emissions affect the most climate vulnerable communities  as well as how their current climate policies can not only contribute to tackle climate change, but also help  revert past inequities of climate burdens.   Given that budgets are mostly constrained, and financing for both tackling climate change as well as  addressing past environmental injustice are not limitless. Financial institutions can help promote policy,  disclosure, and actions that do both. The SEC, for example, is considering in the draft rules, the issue of zip  codes in terms of identifying climate risk areas for a reporting entity. Conversely, zip codes can also be  important indicators of climate vulnerability, linking a reporter’s area of operations with climate  vulnerability for stakeholders. Question (1) of the FDIC statement asks for additional factors, including  location, to inform financial institutions adoption of these principles. It is our belief that financial  institutions that are located in both climate hotspots and around disproportionately vulnerable regions  should take extra precautions to integrate climate mitigation and resilience strategies. Knowing where a  corporations GHG emissions are released and the associated vulnerability of impacted communities, would  allow risks to be weighted to distinguish which communities tend are exposed to the most waste facilities,  emissions, and environmental degradation of the reporter.   Question (5) can be addressed by technologies like CalEnviroScreen map,57 58 which is a database that  outlines the characteristics – including mean income and minority concentration – of specific communities.  This could be used to better understand the climate vulnerability and financial risks of affected  communities. Users can easily determine whether emissions disproportionately target certain zip codes. In  essence, protecting the wellbeing and interests is a question of ethics, and there are a growing number of  investors who want to contribute to social, economic, and environmental conscious considerations.  
  NOTES      1 See: https://center-hre.org. CHRE has extensive experience in policy advising related to combating climate change . More specifically, on the  role of greenhouse gases (GHGs) including short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons HFCs.  Being a core focus of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the immediate reduction of SLCPs indicates their importance to  avoiding irreversible climate catastrophe – or achieving rapid climate cooling by 2030 and remain below 1.5°C of warming noted in the Paris  Agreement.    2 FDIC: SUMMARY: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is requesting comment on draft principles that would provide a high- level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate- related financial risks. Although all financial institutions, regardless  of size, may have material exposures to climate- related financial risks, these draft principles are targeted at the largest financial institutions, those  with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets. The draft principles are intended to support efforts by large financial institutions to focus on  key aspects of climate-related financial risk management.  3 Emissions Gap Report 2021, UNEP. 2021 See: https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2021   4 IPCC.

Also, mitigation of methane, along with non- fossil greenhouse gases including some hydroflurocarbons (HFCs) and black carbon-rich sources of  particulate matter (PM), is the only plausible way of decreasing warming relative to a reference case with minimal changes in current policies  over the next 20 years. This is because a realistically paced phase-out of fossil fuels, or even a rapid one under aggressive decarbonization, is  likely to have minimal net impacts on near-term temperatures due to the removal of co-emitted aerosols (Shindell and Smith 2019). As methane  is the most powerful driver of climate change among the short-lived substances (Myhre et al. 2013), mitigation of methane emissions is very  likely to be the most powerful lever in reducing near-term warming. This is consistent with other assessments; for example, the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) showed that methane controls implemented between 2010 and  2030 would lead to a larger reduction in 2040 warming than the difference between RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0 scenarios.

The CCAC  estimates that widespread action to reduce methane, HFCs, and black carbon will avoid 0.6°C of global warming by 2050.  We can see that  tackling SLCPs have significant, critical, and immediate benefits as climate strategies to keep to 1.5°C by mid-century.

This is shown by increased temperatures, loss of summer sea ice, earlier snow melt,  impacts on ecosystems, and increased economic access. Arctic sea ice volume has decreased by 75% since the 1980s. Long-lasting global  anthropogenic forcing from carbon dioxide has increased over the previous decades and is anticipated to increase over the next decades.  Temperature increases in response to greenhouse gases are amplified in the Arctic through feedback processes associated with shifts in albedo,  ocean and land heat storage, and near-surface longwave radiation fluxes. Thus, for the next few decades out to 2040, continuing environmental  changes in the Arctic are very likely, and the appropriate response is to plan for adaptation to these changes. For example, it is very likely that the  Arctic Ocean will become seasonally nearly sea-ice free before 2050 and possibly within a decade or two, which in turn will further increase  Arctic temperatures, economic access, and ecological shifts. Mitigation becomes an important option to reduce potential Arctic impacts in the  second half of the 21st century. Using the most recent set of climate model projections (CMIP5), multimodel mean temperature projections show  an Arctic-wide end of century increase of +13 oC in late fall and +5 oC in late spring for a business- as-usual emission scenario (RCP8.5) in  contrast to +7 oC in late fall and +3 oC in late spring if civilization follows a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5).

Stochasters acknowledge current conditions and the range of projections suggested by  model results yet point to the lack of being able to forecast the next rapid sea ice loss event. They are saved in part as it will possibly take several  such events to reach the nearly sea ice-free threshold, thus adding some averaging to the final date prediction (hence stochastic). Observations  and citations in this article support the conclusion that current rapid Arctic change, especially loss of multiyear sea ice, is likely out of sample for  most CMIP5 models. Thus, time horizons for summer sea ice loss of these three approaches turns out to be roughly 2020, 2030, and 2040  respectively for trendsetters, stochasters, and modelers. Predictions depend on the weight given to data, understanding of Arctic change  processes, and the use of model projections.

They argue that current climate risk assessments are too long-term and carbon-centric, and advocate for a focus on short-term aggressive reductions of super pollutants like methane and black carbon. CHRE suggests four key improvements: adopting a fast climate mitigation approach, focusing on super pollutants, encouraging financial institutions to contribute to climate solutions, and incorporating environmental justice into climate risk assessments. They stress the importance of immediate action to reduce super pollutants to avoid catastrophic climate impacts and emphasize the role of financial institutions in steering towards sustainable practices. The comment also highlights the need for climate policies to consider social equity and environmental justice, as climate change disproportionately affects disadvantaged communities."

Reg. 19,507 (Apr. 4, 2022) (“Proposed Principles”).  The States are  especially interested in this rule because the FDIC is exercising its prudential regulatory power  over state-licensed financial institutions.  These Principles track nearly word-for-word the proposed principles the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency issued in December 2021.  See Principles for Climate-Related  Financial Risk Management for Large Banks, OCC (Dec. 16, 2021), https://bit.ly/3z58kqj.   Although some interagency cooperation is appropriate in certain circumstances, copying the  language of another agency without explanation effectively abdicates the Corporation’s  independent regulatory responsibilities.  See, e.g., Hoosier Env’t Council v. U.S. Army Corps of  Eng’rs, 722 F.3d 1053, 1061 (7th Cir. 2013) (explaining that an agency had “an independent  responsibility to enforce” a given statute and therefore could not “just rubberstamp another 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 2  agency’s” work).  That approach is especially concerning here given that the Corporation is an  independent agency.  See, e.g., Jolina C. Cuaresma, Commissioning the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, 31 LOY. CONSUMER L. REV. 426, 450 n.109 (2019) (explaining how the FDIC  “has long been considered independent”).    In any event, the Proposed Principles are defective in at least four ways.  First, the Proposed  Principles purport to be guidance, but they are de facto legislative rules issued without adequate  notice.  Second, they are arbitrary and capricious because they single out climate-related risks even  though current regulations already account for those risks.  Third, they arbitrarily and capriciously  fail to include a cost-benefit analysis.  Fourth, they appear to be a pretextual effort to deprive  disfavored industries of access to banking services.  And fifth, they are overly vague and, in at least  some cases, would arbitrarily and capriciously require financial institutions to monitor and account  for immaterial risks.  BACKGROUND  The FDIC recently issued a “Request for Comment on Statement of Principles for Climate- Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.”  See Request for Comment  on Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions, FDIC (Mar. 30, 2022), https://bit.ly/3NpEe4O.  The request seeks comments to help  provide a “high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate- related financial risks.”  Id.  This new framework (which was published in the Federal Register a  few days later) would nominally apply only to “large [state-licensed, non-member] financial  institutions with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets.”  Id.  But in practice, these principles  would apply more broadly, as the FDIC notes that “all financial institutions … may have material  exposures to climate-related financial risks.”  Id. The Corporation highlighted four aspects of the Proposed Principles.  First, the Proposed  Principles address supposed “[w]eaknesses in how financial institutions identify, measure,  monitor, and control” climate risks.    Request for Comment on Statement of Principles for Climate- Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions.  Second, they “provide a  high-level framework for the safe and sound management” for these risks.  Id.  Third, they will  purportedly “help financial institution management make progress toward addressing key  questions” about how climate might affect their business.  Id.  Fourth and finally, they reflect how  the “FDIC encourages financial institutions to consider” climate risks in a way that meets “the  financial services needs of their communities.”  Id.  In the Proposed Principles themselves, the FDIC set out general climate-related financial  risk principles on six topic areas:    1. Governance: how a company supervises and manages itself;   2. Policies, Procedures, and Limits: the rules a company sets for its own operations;  3. Strategic Planning: how a company looks to address issues and grow;   4. Risk Management: how a company handles potential risks;  
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 3  5. Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting: how a company collects data around, analyzes,  and reports risks; and   6. Scenario Analysis: “exercises used to conduct a forward-looking assessment of the  potential impact on an institution” of various changes or the “distribution of physical  hazards resulting from climate-related risks.”    Proposed Principles at 19,509-10.    Similarly, the FDIC also enumerated six climate-related risk categories.  They are:  1. Credit Risk: the possibility of losses from loans not being repaid;  2. Liquidity Risk: the possibility of a lack of liquidity that leads to an institution’s failure to  meet its obligations;  3. Other Financial Risk: any other risks that would affect an institution’s finances, including  the failure of an investment or a drop in a currency’s value.  4. Operational Risk: the risk of loss from internal failures;  5. Legal/Compliance Risk: the risk associated with legal actions and cost of compliance with  regulations; and  6. Other Nonfinancial Risk: all other risks that do not relate to the institution’s finances.  Proposed Principles at 19,510-11.  The FDIC requested feedback on the Proposed Principles.  Id. at 19,511-12.  The undersigned States are taking the Corporation up on its request for feedback on  these significant proposed changes.  DISCUSSION  I. The Proposed “Guidance” Appears To Be Rulemaking In Disguise.  Despite labeling its proposal a “statement of principles,” the Corporation’s proposed  “principles” almost certainly constitute legislative rules.  A legislative rule is “[a]n agency action  that purports to impose legally binding obligations or prohibitions on regulated parties.”  Nat’l  Mining Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 251-52 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  The Proposed Principles  appear to do this very thing: They place brand new requirements on regulated parties and are not  “merely interpret[ing] a prior statute or regulation.”  Id. at 252.  The Proposed Principles change  the FDIC’s previous requirements and thus have the overwhelming appearance of legislative rules.   See Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002, 1021 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (A rule that “effects a substantive  change in existing law or policy” is “necessarily [a] legislative rule[].”)  In fact, save a fleeting  reference to the FDIC’s general power to issue safety-and-soundness standards, Proposed  Principles at 19,509, the Corporation does not mention prior statutes or regulations at all.  And the  Proposed Principles repeatedly use “should” directives; that language is usually construed as  mandatory.  See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 798 F.2d 919, 924 (7th Cir. 1986) (“The common 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 4  interpretation of the word ‘should’ is ‘shall.’”).  In short, the Proposed Principles overwhelmingly  appear to be legislative rules disguised as guidance.    The Proposed Principles resemble the EPA’s guidance that the D.C. Circuit deemed  binding in Natural Resources Defense Council v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  In  that case, the court found that a rule styled as “[g]uidance” was actually a legislative rule because  it bound EPA’s regional directors.  Id. at 321-22.  So too here.  The FDIC should reconsider the  Proposed Principles to avoid this mistake.  As is, the Proposed Principles require regulated  financial institutions to consider climate-related risks above other risks; any bank that chooses to  do otherwise could face serious consequences during a bank examination.  It seems that the FDIC  is thus planning to impose its risk-assessment preferences without regard to the institutions’ own  professional assessments or preferences.  Because this mandate would necessarily alter the  institutions’ risk-management strategies, it bears the marks of a rule—not guidance.  The FDIC should thus subject the Proposed Principles to the Administrative Procedure  Act’s procedural requirements, lest “a reviewing court” “set aside” the Proposed Principles for  “fail[ing] to observe” those requirements.  See Iowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 855  (8th Cir. 2013). And it should heed reviewing courts’ warnings against an agency “issu[ing] or  amend[ing] its real rules, i.e., its interpretative rules and policy statements, quickly and  inexpensively without following any statutorily prescribed procedures.”  Appalachian Power Co.  v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015, 1020 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  In short, the FDIC should not rely on “subsequent  guidance” to provide the specific, discernible standards upon which regulated institutions depend.   Proposed Principles at 19,509, 19,510.  It should instead withdraw the proposal and reissue it with  the full set of findings and analyses that ordinarily accompany a rulemaking.  Further, the FDIC  should do more than give conclusory judgments to explain why rulemaking is necessary in the first  place.    II. The Proposed Principles Arbitrarily And Capriciously Target Climate-Related  Risk.  The Proposed Principles emphasize climate-related risks because of claimed “emerging  economic and financial risks.”  Proposed Principles at 19,508.  The Corporation is vague about  what it has in mind, referencing mostly a myriad of attenuated risks like “wildfires,” “droughts,”  and “rising … sea levels.”  Id.  But the FDIC failed to adequately demonstrate how these potential  events relate to its core mission of regulating certain FDIC-insured financial institutions.  So the  Proposed Principles are arbitrary and capricious.  See Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579  U.S. 211, 221 (2016) (An agency must “give adequate reasons for its decisions.”). Even assuming  the FDIC could demonstrate the connection between financial soundness and environmental  change, the FDIC has not adequately explained why new regulations are necessary in light of  current rules that cover the same field.    Financial institutions are already required to undertake “[e]ffective risk assessment” and  have “[a]dequate procedures to safeguard and manage assets.”  12 C.F.R. pt. 364 II.A.2, A.4.   These controls must be “appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature, scope and risk of  its activities.”  Id. II.A.  Thus, if climate risks are a real threat to an institution, then under current 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 5  regulations they should already be part of that institution’s risk assessment scheme.  Likewise,  regulated institutions are already subject to stringent liquidity requirements.  The Proposed  Principles do nothing except impose redundant regulations and burdens on financial institutions.   See Proposed Principles at 19,508-11.  “Reasoned decisionmaking … calls for an explanation for  agency action.”  Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 2551, 2576 (2019).  Yet the FDIC never  explains why it considers this redundant regulation necessary.  Without this explanation, the  Proposed Principles are arbitrary and capricious.  See Am. Equity Inv. Life Ins. Co. v. SEC, 613  F.3d 166, 179 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (vacating an SEC rule because it failed “to determine whether,  under the existing regime, sufficient protections existed”).   The Proposed Principles also single out climate risks—which are unrelated to the financial  institution’s day-to-day business—when numerous other eventualities pose equal or greater risks.   Economic downturns, foreign conflicts, changing consumer tastes, non-climate-related natural  disasters, and public health crises, for example, all can and have had catastrophic effects on  financial institutions.  Yet, the FDIC has subjected none of these issues to special regulation.  The  FDIC should explain why it focused its attention on climate risks as more important than numerous  others.  Cf. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-74 (1886) (“Though the law itself be fair on its  face, and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority … so  as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar  circumstances … the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the [C]onstitution.”). The Corporation’s failure to explain why it proposes to treat climate-related risks with heightened  scrutiny takes the Proposed Principles out of the “zone of reasonableness” and makes the action  arbitrary and capricious.  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158-61 (2021).   Indeed, the Corporation fails to cite any empirical data establishing that climate-related risk  presents any safety-and-soundness concern, let alone one so significant that it requires special  treatment.  III. The Proposed Principles Lack A Cost-Benefit Analysis.  The Proposed Principles also do not discuss the potential costs of imposing these new  requirements.  This silence is telling—it means that the FDIC has failed to perform a proper cost- benefit analysis, in spite of its self-recognized obligation to do so in rulemaking.  See FDIC OFF. OF INSPECTOR GEN., COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS PROCESS  FOR RULEMAKING (2020),  https://bit.ly/38FdnTQ (describing the FDIC’s cost-benefit analyses and noting past failures of the  FDIC to properly conduct them).  Just as calling the proposal “guidance” does not change the  reality that it would function as a legislative rule, it also does not erase the FDIC’s duty to conduct  a proper cost-benefit analysis.    Make no mistake: cost-benefit analysis is required.  Congress empowered the Corporation  to implement “appropriate” operational or managerial standards for regulated institutions.  12  U.S.C.A. § 1831p-1.  The Supreme Court has held that an agency charged with determining  whether a regulation is “appropriate or necessary” must consider cost as part of that determination.   Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 759 (2015).  This cost-benefit analysis must be performed at an  early enough stage to allow interested parties time to respond.  Any failure to do so would render  the Proposed Principles arbitrary and capricious.  See id.
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 6  The Corporation’s failure to conduct an adequate cost-benefit analysis is especially  problematic given that the Proposed Principles would have tremendous negative effects.  We  expect that financial institutions would have to bear huge costs in terms of both money and  personnel to comply.  Compliance costs like these are the “most important[] cost[s]” that an agency  “must consider.”  Michigan, 576 U.S. at 759.  Those costs could be especially high given the  current lack of data on climate-related risk and the relative novelty of some of the methodologies  that the Corporation proposes to require, such as scenario analysis.  Additionally, the complexity  and scope of the Proposed Principles would open up financial institutions to greater litigation risks,  another obvious cost that the FDIC has not addressed.  The FDIC says this regulation will apply to only the “largest financial institutions,”  Proposed Principles at 19,509, but the effects will be felt more broadly.  Large financial institutions  will inevitably disperse their compliance costs onto others through higher interest rates and other  means.  Thus, it is small businesses and individuals—who cannot pass on costs further  downstream—who will suffer from the increased operating costs the proposal will force onto  financial institutions.  And because the Proposed Principles required consideration of climate- related risks “as part of the underwriting” process, individuals who live in areas that financial  institutions believe are at climate risk would likely find it harder to buy homes or start businesses,  particularly if the home or business itself is alleged to contribute to the conditions that give rise to  climate risk.  Id. at 19,510.  These costs are yet more in a long list that the Proposed Principles  failed to consider.  IV. The Proposed Principles Appear To Constitute A Pretextual Effort To “De-Bank”  Certain Industries.  The Proposed Principles would also have an unjustifiably negative effect on certain  industries.  For instance, the proposal directs financial institutions to consider climate-related risks  concerning “the institution’s reputation” and “stakeholders’ expectations,” so regulated  institutions are likely to consider whether credit applicants are politically favored in terms of their  climate efforts when deciding whether to extend credit.  Proposed Principles at 19,510.  Thus,  industries such as mining or power generation would be particularly vulnerable.  Businesses in  these industries may more often have credit denied, or be offered credit on worse terms than  otherwise similarly situated applicants.  Limiting these businesses’ financial access would likely  raise the cost of everyday necessities like electricity—a concern to which the FDIC should be more  attuned, not less, in the current economic environment.  Similarly, customers located in geographic  areas thought to be most affected by climate change (like coastal areas or sensitive agricultural  regions) might find it difficult to obtain credit at all, lest the lending institution face criticism from  the examiner for assuming undue risk.  The Corporation’s failure to explain the supposed need for an immediate revision of the  supervisory standards strongly implies that the effort is pretextual.  Although “a court may not  reject an agency’s stated reasons for acting simply because the agency might also have had other  unstated reasons,” including political ones, a court may set aside agency action where the record  demonstrates that “the sole stated reason” for the action is pretextual and “contrived.”  New York,  139 S. Ct. at 2573-75.  The Proposed Principles—which encourage regulated institutions to target 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 7  “certain companies or sectors” that the FDIC believes “may become less competitive” over time— appear ripe for such a challenge.  Proposed Principles at 19,508.  Indeed, the Proposed Principles  go so far as to require a financial institution’s board and management to adopt an “appropriate  understanding” of climate-related risk—that is, a view of climate change consistent with the  Corporation’s.  Id. at 19,509.  At the same time, the Proposed Principles repeatedly call on  regulated institutions to divert attention to “low- to moderate-income (LMI) and other  disadvantaged households and communities,” see, e.g., id. at 19,509, further suggesting that the  Corporation is pressing a deliberate reallocation of capital access.    The Corporation should be intimately familiar with the consequences of policies targeting  disfavored industries after it pursued similar policies as part of its regulatory misadventure known  as Operation Chokepoint.  There, as here, the FDIC sought to deny banking services to certain  industries that the then-current President’s administration did not favor.  See Letter from Stephen  E. Boyd, Assistant Att’y Gen., to the Honorable Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, Comm. on the  Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives (Aug. 16, 2017), available at https://bit.ly/3MzydCF  (describing the FDIC’s “misguided” “Operation Chokepoint” and reaffirming the Department of  Justice’s view that “law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an  industry that a particular administration might disfavor”).  Yet given that this “guidance” comes  one year after President Biden directed members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to  evaluate climate-related risk, it would appear that the Corporation is poised to make the same  mistake again.  See Exec. Order No. 14,030, 87 Fed. Reg. 27,967 (May 20, 2021).   V. The Proposed Principles Are Arbitrarily And Capriciously Vague And May  Require Monitoring And Reporting Of Immaterial Risks.  Despite their stated purpose of providing a “framework for the safe and sound management  of exposures to climate-related risk,” Proposed Principles at 19,509, the Proposed Principles do  little to explain the actual nature and scope of that risk to financial institutions.  This vagueness  leaves unclear how institutions are supposed to operate in this realm, opening them to litigation or  additional audit risk from failure to comply with vague requirements.  By not laying out the facts  supporting the proposal or explaining how exactly institutions should respond, the FDIC has failed  to provide a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Little Sisters of  the Poor Saints Peter & Paul Home v. Pennsylvania, 140 S. Ct. 2367, 2383 (2020).  Predictions about the physical risks of climate change vary greatly and include a massive  number of potential consequences.  The FDIC itself lists “flooding, hurricanes, wildfires, and  droughts” as examples.  Proposed Principles at 19,508 n.3.  But empirical data from the Federal  Reserve Board show that severe weather events have little effect on bank performance.  See  Kristian S. Blickle, et al., How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks?, 990 FED. RESERVE BANK  OF N.Y. STAFF REP. 1, 1 (2022 revision), available at https://nyfed.org/3wHA42U (“When we  consider all FEMA disasters, we find generally insignificant or small effects on bank performance  and stability.”).  In any event, with such an array of eventualities, financial institutions face a  monumental task in discerning which they must prepare for and how.  Not even the largest  institutions can make accurate predictions.  Yet the proposal fails to offer concrete guidance for  financial institutions to help them decide what specific problems to consider and how to address 
Hon. Martin J. Gruenberg  June 3, 2022  Page 8  them.  In arbitrary-and-capricious review, courts look for a clear enough explanation that an  agency’s “path may reasonably be discerned.”  Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys.,  Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974).  The FDIC’s current path is impossible even to recognize, let alone  follow.  Additionally, the Proposed Principles’ vagueness expands their scope and will force banks  to consider immaterial risks.  For example, banks are specifically instructed to consider “physical  risks” such as “flooding, hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts.”  Proposed Principles at 19,508 n.3.   This natural-disaster-related mandate is imposed without any qualification or explanation as to  when banks must consider these risks.  Does a bank in Montana have to explicitly consider and  evaluate its hurricane risk?  In their current state, the Proposed Principles say yes.    The Proposed Principles also require financial institutions to consider outright impossible  concerns such as the climate’s effect on “the evolving legal and regulatory landscape.”  Proposed  Principles at 19,511.  The future of legislation and regulation is notoriously difficult to predict, so  institutions will be forced to rely on extremely speculative guesses about what might happen.  The  Proposed Principles offer no meaningful guidance as to what the FDIC expects from them.   Guessing games like this legislative look-ahead are harmful and inappropriate for financial  institutions upon which so many peoples’ livelihoods depend.  Yet, the Proposed Principles  actually encourage banks to limit access to capital based on unfounded fears and guesses, saying  that institutions should “include corresponding measures of conservatism in their risk  measurements and controls” when considering climate risks.  Id. at 19,511.  Banks should not be  limiting access to capital based on unsupported supposition and political preferences.    CONCLUSION  The FDIC should not adopt the Proposed Principles.  If adopted as written, they would  constitute a procedurally improper and arbitrary and capricious legislative rule.  We urge the FDIC  to reconsider its proposal.

They argue that the principles, which closely mirror those of the OCC, abdicate the FDIC's independent regulatory responsibilities. The principles are criticized for being de facto legislative rules issued without proper notice, arbitrarily focusing on climate risks, lacking a cost-benefit analysis, and potentially depriving certain industries of banking services. The AGs claim the principles are vague, requiring financial institutions to monitor immaterial risks, and may be a pretext to ""de-bank"" disfavored industries. They urge the FDIC to reconsider the proposal, arguing it constitutes improper rulemaking and could have negative economic impacts."

To do so, EDF links science, economics,  law, and innovative private-sector partnerships. Policy Integrity is a non-partisan think tank  dedicated to improving the quality of government decisionmaking through advocacy and  scholarship in the fields of administrative law, economics, and public policy.   EDF and Policy Integrity support the Draft Principles as an important step in the FDIC’s efforts to  guide banks to update their risk management practices as needed in light of climate-related  financial risks, thereby promoting safety and soundness. We recommend that the FDIC  continue building upon these Draft Principles with more detailed guidance, as it has indicated it  plans to do, moving expeditiously and in coordination with other regulators working to address    1 These comments do not necessarily reflect the views of NYU School of Law, if any.  2 Fed.

  2  climate-related financial risk. We offer the following recommendations to help inform that  process:3  I.  The FDIC should consider offering more detailed guidance regarding the physical and  transition risks that affect the management of various risk areas. (Draft Principles Section I,  “Introduction,” and Section III, “Management of Risk Areas”)  II.  The FDIC should consider guiding banks on the use of relevant, accurate, and timely  climate-related data for risk management and reporting. (Draft Principles Section II, “General  Principles”)  III.  The FDIC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into regulatory  reports and can leverage other entities’ work on climate-related disclosures. (Draft Principles,  Question 12)  IV.  In designing and executing scenario analyses, the FDIC should consider defining orderly  transition, disorderly transition, and hot-house scenarios, setting at least a thirty-year analysis  period, and accounting for the correlated nature of risks. (Draft Principles, Question 14)  V.  The FDIC should consider how to mitigate potential harm to disadvantaged communities  from banks’ climate risk management strategies. (Draft Principles Section I, “Introduction,”  Section II, “General Principles,” and Question 10)    I.   The FDIC should consider offering more detailed guidance regarding the physical and  transition risks that affect the management of various risk areas. (Draft Principles  Section I, “Introduction,” and Section III, “Management of Risk Areas”)  Although the Draft Principles provide an outline of how banks should approach managing  climate risk within their portfolios, they could be buttressed with additional insight into what  types of risks may manifest themselves.4 The FDIC notes that it “will elaborate on these risk  assessment principles in subsequent guidance.”5 We support the FDIC’s intent to issue  additional guidance (including the specified elements), recommend that the FDIC make this  further guidance publicly available, and provide a non-exhaustive list of additional  considerations it should include. In addition, we encourage the FDIC to more clearly highlight  climate-related market risk, discuss the interconnectedness of these risk areas, and include  private governance initiatives as an area of non-financial risk.     3 In parentheses beside each heading, we note the question(s) and/or section(s) from the Draft Principles to which  the comment section is most relevant.  4 Draft Principles, supra note 2, at 19,510–11.  5 Id. at 19,510. Specifically, the FDIC intends to put forth subsequent guidance regarding these principles that will  “distinguish roles and responsibilities of boards of directors (boards) and management, incorporate the feedback  received on the draft principles, and consider lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other  jurisdictions.” Id. at 19,509. 
  3  Climate-related financial risk is generally divided into two broad categories: physical risks and  transition risks.6 Physical risks include the damages wrought by wildfires, flooding, extreme  heat, and other direct results of climate change.7 Transition risks are the costs associated with  societal shifts in response to climate change, such as those from technological and policy  changes, changing consumer sentiment, and liability for climate damages.8 Typical bank  portfolios exhibit both physical and transition risks. The FDIC briefly discusses how some of  these risks may affect banks in the introduction to the Draft Principles.9   The FDIC identifies the following risk management areas in its Draft Principles: credit risk,  liquidity risk, other financial risk (including price and interest rate risks), operational risk,  legal/compliance risk, and other non-financial risk (including reputational, liability, and litigation  risks).10 Additional guidance explicitly outlining the types of climate-related risks relevant to  each risk management area would set clearer expectations for the scope of banks’ risk  assessments and make it more likely that banks acquire the tools necessary to assess the  climate risks in their portfolios.11 While climate risks are similar to other types of financial risks,  it is also the case that “the nature of climate risks is less familiar to financial institutions.”12  Financial institutions are still building the expertise needed to identify potential climate risks  and providing more tailored guidance will ensure that banks are on the right track.   A. The FDIC should consider clarifying how climate-related credit risk implicates both an  obligor’s ability to pay a loan, as well as risk to the underlying collateral.  The FDIC should consider providing examples of the types of credit risk that banks should  review in risk assessments. In particular, the FDIC could demonstrate ways climate change  could either reduce an obligor’s ability to pay or cause damage to the underlying collateral,  increasing a bank’s losses in the case of default. Currently, the Draft Principles focus most  closely on the risks associated with credit concentration within a particular market or region.13  While these risks are important and bear discussion, other portfolio risks could also be made  clear.    6 See, e.g., Madison Condon et al., Mandating Disclosure of Climate-Related Financial Risk, 23 N.Y.U.

  4  The FDIC’s Banker Resource Center defines credit risk as “the potential that a borrower or  counterparty will not repay a debt obligation.”14 The magnitude of this risk depends on both  the likelihood that the obligor will pay their debt and the value the bank can recover if the  obligor fails to do so. In other words, credit risk responds both to the creditworthiness of the  obligor and to changes in the value of the underlying collateral. Climate risk is present in both  considerations.   There are myriad reasons why climate-related risks could decrease the probability of debt  repayment. For example, as the world transitions to a low- or zero-carbon economy, a fossil-  fuel company may abandon certain projects—a transition risk. Similarly, new environmental  regulations—such as the regulation of methane emissions—could make fossil fuels less  profitable. Physical risks could mean that a company dependent on physical outdoor labor  could have diminished productivity with increasing incidences of extreme heat. An agricultural  company might face reduced crop yields. Banks should weigh these risks when assessing the  creditworthiness of a debtor.  Additionally, a failure to contemplate physical and transition risks may mean that the collateral  underlying a loan is overvalued. Consider, for example, a home in California in a wildfire-prone  area. If the home burns down—a physical risk—the value of the collateral is severely reduced.  Even absent a fire, the looming specter of this risk could cause a home to lose value if, for  example, insurers are no longer willing to cover the risk of wildfires or if consumers have  concerns about living in wildfire-prone areas.15   In assessing a bank’s safety and soundness, the FDIC already considers a bank’s underwriting  practices with regards to the sufficiency of collateral and creditworthiness of obligors.16 The  climate’s impact on credit risk is an aspect of these traditional concerns. By providing  illustrative examples of credit risks, the FDIC can ensure these risks receive sufficient due  diligence.     14 Credit, FED. DEPOSIT INS.

  5  B. The FDIC should consider providing more detail on the types of climate-related liquidity  risks a bank may face.  While the FDIC properly includes liquidity risk as a category to be considered in risk  assessments, additional detail would be useful. The FDIC should consider clearly laying out  examples of climate-related liquidity risks and also describe how liquidity risks may  exacerbate—or be exacerbated by—operational and market risk.17 Liquidity risks may  materialize when there is reduced buyer interest in particular assets. For example, societal  movement away from fossil fuels could result in stranded assets, posing liquidity issues for  banks invested in these assets.18  C. The FDIC should consider providing additional detail on market risk and suggesting  acceptable measurement methods for such risk.  The Draft Principles section on “Other Financial Risk” discusses interest and price risk— components of market risk.19 The FDIC notes that there are challenges with existing  methodologies to estimate these risks and therefore advises banks to “use the best  measurement methodologies reasonably available to them.”20 The FDIC should consider  treating market risk more explicitly within the Draft Principles and suggesting an array of  acceptable measurement methodologies.  Market risk—the risk that an institution’s investments lose value—is a significant avenue for  climate-related financial risk. Physical risks, for example, can threaten commodities, such as  agricultural products, which could affect future values.21 Transition risks can also affect  investment value. For example, policy or technology changes that align the U.S. energy system  with a carbon-zero future could lead to declines in the oil market;22 given the global nature of  the oil market, policy or technology changes in other parts of the world could lower demand for  oil as well.23 The FDIC could provide further explanation of risks like these.    17 Nahiomy Alvarez et al., A New Framework for Assessing Climate Change Risk in Financial Markets, 448 CHICAGO  FED.

ON BANKING SUPERVISION, CLIMATE-RELATED RISK DRIVERS AND THEIR TRANSMISSION CHANNELS 24 (Apr.  2021), https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d517.pdf (noting that “countries, regions and sectors are exposed to  different levels of transition risk depending on the likelihood of policy action, technological innovation or broad  shifts in sentiment within a particular jurisdiction”). 
  6  The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) proposed regulations on climate-related  disclosures, when finalized, should assist banks in considering climate impacts as they make  certain types of investments.24 In turn, this should make it easier to conduct thorough risk  assessments regarding market risk. However, many tradeable assets may not be subject to the  SEC’s regulation. Municipal bonds, for example, are not subject to SEC reporting  requirements.25 The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has requested that the  Municipal Securities Regulation Board (“MSRB”) examine how best to estimate climate-related  risk; the FDIC should remain abreast of this work.26   These market considerations are within the ambit of risks that banks should already be  considering. Bank supervisors already assess the “degree to which changes in interest rates,  foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, or equity prices can adversely affect a financial  institution’s earnings or economic capital.”27 The Draft Principles nevertheless serve as a critical  reminder that the climate crisis will likely affect these prices in a tangible way and that these  climate risks must be contemplated. Adding more detail could help ensure that banks properly  consider these risks.    D. The FDIC should consider describing third-party operational risk in more detail.  The Draft Principles provide some detail on how climate change could exacerbate operational  risks. Additional concrete examples, demonstrating the range of risks, could be helpful,  particularly regarding third-party risk. Even if a bank’s operation centers do not themselves face  climate risk, if they depend on at-risk infrastructure—such as sanitation and power grids—the  risk inherent in that infrastructure propagates to the business operations. While Hurricane  Sandy caused evacuation orders that directly shuttered many Wall Street banks, in February  2021, it was failures in the Texas electricity grid that forced banks to close branches.28 In our  interdependent world, it is not sufficient to consider only the risk associated with a particular  parcel of land; banks must also consider how third-party risk enters the system.

  7  Principles mention “third-party operations” as a source of risk,29 making these connections  more explicit will encourage banks to create more robust plans.  E. The FDIC should consider more explicitly describing how legal and compliance risk  interplay with other forms of risk.  While the Draft Principles currently discuss legal and compliance risk, the FDIC should consider  expanding the discussion to describe the interconnectedness between legal risk and other  types of risk. For example, the FDIC flags “changes to legal requirements for . . . flood or  disaster related insurance” as an area of potential legal or compliance risk.30 While changes to  these legal requirements would pose a compliance risk for a bank, it is also the case that  changes in insurance requirements could pose a credit risk, particularly given that property and  casualty insurance terms are often only a few years long—shorter than many loan terms.31  F. The FDIC should consider including private governance initiatives as a sub-category when  discussing other non-financial risk.  The FDIC notes that banks should consider other non-financial risks, such as reputational  damage, liability, and litigation. In addition to these risks, the FDIC should also consider  explicitly mentioning the potential for private governance initiatives,32 including investor  pressure. Member banks of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance have committed to align their assets  and liabilities with a pathway to a net-zero carbon emission earth by 2050.33 It is possible that  banks that have not made such commitments will face investor pressure to do so and, on the  other hand, that banks that have committed will be held to those commitments by  shareholders. In either case, banks should be aware of their position within the net-zero  commitment landscape.  II.  The FDIC should consider guiding banks on the use of relevant, accurate, and timely  climate-related data for risk management and reporting. (Draft Principles Section II,  “General Principles”)  As the FDIC recognizes in its Draft Principles, “[s]ound climate risk management depends on the  availability of relevant, accurate, and timely data.”34 The FDIC should consider guiding banks on  best practices regarding sources and analytical methods for climate risk data.      29 Draft Principles, supra note 2, at 19,511.  30 Id.  31 See Antonio Grimaldi et al., Climate Change and P&C Insurance: The Threat and the Opportunity, MCKINSEY & CO.

(forthcoming), https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3764130 (analyzing transition risks stemming  from the pressures that private environmental governance initiatives can create for companies).  33 Net-Zero Banking Alliance, U.N.

  8  Banks should use data both from counterparties and from public sources to develop a  comprehensive picture of their climate-related risk exposure. With transactional  counterparties, banks should solicit information regarding risks to the particular assets or  activities involved in the transaction, as well as risks to the counterparty’s creditworthiness  generally.35 The FDIC could also guide banks on reliable sources and proper uses of various  types of publicly available data, such as climate-related disclosures, climate projections, and  climate-related financial risks. Data should be incorporated as relevant into identification,  measurement, management, and disclosure of climate risks.    To efficiently develop rigorous and consistent climate data practices, the FDIC should consider  ways to coordinate with other regulators working to address climate risks, as well as other  experts and stakeholders. The FDIC’s membership in FSOC, which has commenced work on  climate risk issues including data,36 as well as in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council (“FFIEC”), provide important opportunities for coordination among U.S. financial  regulators generally and banking regulators specifically. Given the global nature of both the  financial system and climate risks, continued participation by the FDIC in the Network for  Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”)37 and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  (“BCBS”)38 will also be important. Finally, the FDIC can benefit from communication with other  agencies with expertise in climate-related data, like the Environmental Protection Agency, the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, including through structures like interagency working groups.   III.  The FDIC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into regulatory  reports and can leverage other entities’ work on climate-related disclosures. (Draft  Principles, Question 12)  The FDIC should consider requiring banks to incorporate climate risk into the disclosures made  in their quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (“call reports”) and any other  regulatory reports where such information is relevant. Requiring public disclosures by regulated  entities of climate-related financial risks can spur better risk identification and management  practices by those entities, as well as provide benefits for regulators, investors, the market, and  the general public. In designing these requirements, the FDIC can leverage existing and  forthcoming work by other regulators, entities, and experts on disclosure of climate-related  financial risk.    35 Cf. Env’t Def.

  9    Call reports are a core source of data for safety and soundness supervision, and the FDIC should  consider how these reports can be updated to reflect climate-related financial risks to banks. As  the FDIC states, banking regulators use call reports “in monitoring the condition, performance,  and risk profile of individual institutions and the industry as a whole.”39 The FFIEC provides  instructions on preparation of call reports.40 Updating these instructions with details on where  and how to incorporate climate risk into a call report will benefit both the reporting entities and  the users of reported information.41 Standardizing disclosures helps to ensure that they are  comparable, specific, and decision-useful.42    Disclosing climate risk information publicly, such as through call reports,43 benefits multiple  stakeholders.44 As explained by FSOC, “[r]egulatory reports assist the federal banking agencies  in fulfilling their supervisory mandates, and assist the public, state banking authorities,  researchers, and bank rating agencies in understanding the condition of the banking sector.”45  Mandating disclosures would benefit banks by compelling them “to engage in careful and  systematic analyses of their exposures to climate risk, preventing them from ignoring worst- case scenarios or unfavorable information,” while also addressing the collective action  problems and mismatched incentives that dissuade voluntary disclosures.46 Access to improved  climate risk information benefits investors, who can better align their investment decisions with  their objectives, which in turn helps the market avoid the destabilizing effects of a burst  “climate bubble.”47 Given the role climate-related disclosures can play in preventing economic  crises and internalizing externalities, the greater public also benefits.48  Many other entities, including other regulators, NGOs, and IGOs, have undertaken efforts on  developing climate-related disclosures that the FDIC can leverage to the extent that they are    39 Bank Financial Reports, FED.

  10  relevant in this context. The FDIC should continue to engage as a member of and draw from the  climate risk disclosure resources developed by FSOC, NGFS,49 and BCBS.50 The BCBS climate risk  principles include guidelines specifically for examiners as well as for banks, an approach that  the FDIC should consider for its subsequent guidance.51 Among U.S. federal regulators, the SEC  has made the most progress to date, with a rulemaking on climate-related disclosure standards  currently underway. In addition to looking to the SEC’s approach itself, the FDIC can analyze the  voluminous materials on climate disclosures that various experts submitted in response to the  SEC’s March 2021 request for public input52 and continue to submit in response to its March  2022 proposed rule.53 Many of those submissions (and the SEC’s proposed rule) highlighted the  work of voluntary disclosure regimes like the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosures54 and the industry-specific Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standards  (including for financial institutions),55 which could likewise be useful resources for the FDIC.   Banking regulators in other jurisdictions both internationally, like the European Central Bank  (“ECB”),56 and sub-nationally in the United States, like the New York Department of Financial  Services,57 have also taken substantial steps on disclosure of climate risk by regulated entities.  The FDIC may also consider consulting with other types of state regulators that administer  reporting or disclosure requirements relevant to certain climate-related physical or transition  risks, including greenhouse gas emissions. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, for  example, could provide valuable information on methane disclosure from the oil and gas  sector. Furthermore, convening structures for banking industry participants like the Climate  Financial Risk Forum58 and the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative59 have produced  multiple reports and guides reflecting the industry’s views on best climate risk practices.     49 See NGFS Publications, NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FIN.

  11  IV.  In designing and executing scenario analyses, the FDIC should consider defining  orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot-house scenarios, setting at least a  thirty-year analysis period, and accounting for the correlated nature of risks. (Draft  Principles, Question 14)  A number of other jurisdictions have begun conducting either scenario analyses or stress tests  over the past few years. These jurisdictions include the ECB,60 the Bank of England,61 the Bank  of Canada, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,62 among many others.63 The FDIC should  take notice of the scenarios used by these jurisdictions and their comparative advantages, as  well as the sample scenarios prepared by NGFS.64 Here, we flag three best practices of  particular interest: in designing and executing scenario analyses, the FDIC should consider  defining scenarios that include an orderly and disorderly transition, as well as a hot-house  scenario, setting at least a thirty-year analysis window, and accounting for the correlated  nature of risks.  A. The FDIC should consider designing orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot- house scenarios in order to ensure that banks are exercising safe and sound practices  with regards to each of these possible these outcomes.   The FDIC should consider designing scenarios reflecting an orderly transition, disorderly  transition, and hot-house world, in order to ensure that banks are meeting safety and  soundness assessments under each of these possible future scenarios.  Much is still uncertain about the extent to which the world will rise to the challenge of climate  change. The scientific community, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  “has collectively chosen four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs),” reflecting a range  of possible trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting climate impacts, “to help    60 Spyros Alogoskoufis et al., ECB Economy-Wide Climate Stress Test, EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (Working Paper No.  281, Sept. 2021), https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op281~05a7735b1c.en.pdf.  61 GUIDANCE FOR PARTICIPANTS OF THE 2021 BIENNIAL EXPLORATORY SCENARIO: FINANCIAL RISKS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE, BANK OF  ENGLAND (2021), https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/stress-testing/2021/the-2021-biennial- exploratory-scenario-on-the-financial-risks-from-climate-change.pdf.  62 HONG KONG MONETARY AUTHORITY, PILOT BANKING SECTOR CLIMATE RISK STRESS TEST (2021),  https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-functions/banking- stability/Pilot_banking_sector_climate_risk_stress_test.pdf.  63 See NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FIN.

  12  [standardize] and improve comparability of climate change analysis.”65 Financial sector experts  then analyze the economic implications of these different emissions pathways, taking into  account the accompanying societal action. The best-case scenario is an “orderly transition,”  meaning stakeholders reduce emissions at a consistent rate, stemming warming around 1.5 to  2°C, as compared to pre-industrial levels.66 This approach would blunt the worst of physical  risks, while imposing some transition costs. On the other hand, it is possible that no climate  action—beyond current policies—is taken. In this case, warming peaks at a much higher level  leading to a “hot-house” scenario.67 Under a hot-house scenario, early transition costs are  limited because the economy does not decarbonize; however, physical risks are much more  severe than under an orderly transition.68 A third possibility is between the two: a “disorderly  transition.”69 In this scenario, emissions continue at the level of current policy commitments for  another decade or so, at which point severe physical harms spur action to limit warming to 1.5  to 2°C, leading to increased transition costs as the world strives to reduce emissions on a  shortened timeline. This third scenario, therefore, carries both high initial physical costs and  high and abrupt transition costs, though ultimately lower physical risks than the hot-house  scenario.  Depending on which scenario occurs, the nature, timing, and scale of physical and transition  costs vary. In order to understand whether banks will continue to meet safety and soundness  requirements, it is necessary to understand how banks’ portfolios would be affected under  these different possible pathways. Among other jurisdictions that have conducted scenario  analysis, the three scenarios described above are a consistent fixture, with the primary  variation being whether the orderly and disorderly transition cap warming at 1.5 or 2.0°C.70   B. The FDIC should consider at least a thirty year time horizon and would likely benefit from  also considering longer horizons.  In determining the time horizon of the scenario analysis, the FDIC should consider at least a  thirty year time horizon and would likely benefit from considering longer time periods as well,  capacity permitting. NGFS notes the tradeoffs in setting a time window for scenario analysis.  While a shorter scenario window period reduces uncertainty in the estimate and may be more  immediately actionable, a longer window gives more thorough insight into climate-related risks    65 NETWORK FOR GREENING THE FIN.

  13  that are likely to affect the financial institution’s balance sheet, long-term, particularly as assets  can be long-lived.71   Other jurisdictions have taking varying approaches, with some setting windows in 2050, 2080,  and 2100, while others consider a timescale of five years or less.72 If possible, sampling a short,  medium, and long-term window would allow the FDIC to gain the most thorough understanding  of a bank’s risk. It may be particularly important to include a window that is at least thirty years  in length, in order to account for the traditional thirty year mortgage cycle and other long-term  loans. The mortgages that banks make today, for example, could be on their balance sheets  until 2052, at which point the collateral will have faced highly escalated physical risks from  climate change.  C. In executing scenario analyses, the FDIC should be mindful of correlated risks.  In executing scenario analyses, the FDIC should be mindful of the interplay among correlated  risks. Sudden, large shocks to a bank’s portfolio could be more damaging than risks accruing  over time in a more manageable fashion. Regional banks, for example, could be at particular  risk from geographically correlated risks, such as wildfires or hurricanes. Although non-regional  banks benefit from geographical diversity, they are not immune to correlated risks. Climate  change may cause shifting environmental conditions and extreme weather events that affect  large portions of the world at the same time.73 Furthermore, transition risks are also correlated.  Under a scenario that includes decarbonization due to policy or technology changes, for  example, there may be mass devaluation of oil and gas assets.74 This could lead to large  portions of a bank’s portfolio losing value simultaneously. The Federal Reserve Bank of New  York has published research investigating the risk to banks from various stranded asset  scenarios that may be useful in informing the FDIC’s thinking.75   V.  The FDIC should consider how to mitigate potential harm to disadvantaged  communities from banks’ climate risk management strategies. (Draft Principles  Section I, “Introduction,” Section II, “General Principles,” and Question 10)  The FDIC recognized in its Draft Principles that banks’ climate risk management strategies have  the potential to harm “disadvantaged households and communities”76 that also face    71 NGFS Guide to Climate Scenario Analysis, supra note 65, at 14–15.  72 Id.  73 See Condon, supra note 47, at 82–83 (“Recent studies, for example, have highlighted the increasing, yet still  largely unanticipated, chance for simultaneous temperature- and weather-induced crop failures in key  breadbaskets around the world.”); Jitendra Singh et al., Enhanced Risk of Concurrent Regional Droughts with  Increased ENSO Variability and Warming, 12 NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE 163 (2022),  https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01276-3.pdf.  74 See, e.g., Jean-Francois Mercure et al., Macroeconomic Impact of Stranded Fossil Fuel Assets, 8 NATURE CLIMATE  CHANGE 588 (2018), https://perma.cc/7YWU-9ZG3.  75 Hyeyoon Jung et al., Climate Stress Testing, 977 FED.

  14  disproportionately high physical climate impacts.77 As the FDIC’s Draft Principles state, “the  manner in which financial institutions manage climate-related financial risks to address safety  and soundness concerns should also seek to reduce or mitigate . . . the disproportionate impact  of risk on . . . disadvantaged communities.”78 Having recognized this risk and urged banks to  mitigate it, the FDIC should consider further steps to ensure that banks do so, including offering  additional guidance, working with other agencies, and incorporating the input of affected  communities. The FDIC should ensure that such steps both inform and are informed by its  recently announced joint efforts with the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of  the Currency (“OCC”) to update the Community Reinvestment Act regulations.79  Due to historical and ongoing injustices, low-income communities and communities of color  face heightened climate risks such as flooding, wildfires, and heat stress.80 Some of these  inequities can be traced back to redlining, a set of racist housing policies that pushed  communities of color into less desirable areas, with disparities in environmental hazards that  persist to this day.81 Differential spending on infrastructure, such as sewer systems, and  disaster assistance has reinforced this divide in risk.82 Today, a home located in a historically  redlined neighborhood is 20% more likely to suffer high flood risk than a home in a greenlined  neighborhood.83 Historically redlined neighborhoods also face higher heat stress.84   As a result, if banks decided to reduce lending in areas exposed to higher physical climate risks  as a risk management strategy, low-income communities and communities of color could be  disproportionately affected.85 The FDIC recognizes this concern in its Draft Principles, urging  banks to consider “climate-related financial risk impacts on . . .

  15  products and services.”86 The FDIC also advises banks to consider “possible fair lending  concerns if the financial institution’s risk mitigation measures disproportionately affect  communities or households on a prohibited basis such as race or ethnicity.”87  The FDIC should contemplate whether and how it could supplement the Draft Principles to  mitigate the risk of inequitably reduced credit access and also how it might work with other  agencies to address these challenges more comprehensively, informed by the input of affected  communities. For example, in subsequent guidance, the FDIC could consider more specifically  outlining intersections between climate risk and banks’ obligations under the Fair Housing Act,  Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and Community Reinvestment Act.88 This could include offering  recommendations for banks on strategies for reducing climate risk exposure that would  preserve lending in low-income communities and communities of color, such as advising banks  on how to weigh resilience measures in risk assessments.   With other agencies, the FDIC could consider supporting the formation of a coordinating  structure, such as an interagency working group, focused on the issue of continued credit and  insurance access in low-income areas at heightened risk from climate change.89 In addition to  the Federal Reserve and the OCC, a non-exhaustive list of potential agency members could  include the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates disaster relief funding  and is working to update its practices to advance equity and bolster climate resilience;90 the  Federal Insurance Office, which is researching climate change-driven insurance coverage gaps;91  the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is working on issues of climate risk    86 Id. at 19,510.  87 Id. at 19,511.  88 See Fair Lending, FED.

F 801.364.4495 ! www.utah.bank    June 3, 2022        Mr. James Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429    RE: STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES FOR CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT FOR  LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS [RIN 3064-ZA32]    Dear Mr. Sheesley,    The Utah Bankers Association writes to urge the FDIC to take all reasonable and appropriate measures to  ensure any principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks, if finalized, do not  facilitate the choking off of lawful but climate-disfavored industries from the banking system.  Banks should  have the ability to lend to any consumer or corporate citizen who is creditworthy and engaged in lawful  activity, without fear of political or regulatory retribution.  Accordingly, we would oppose the FDIC or any  financial regulator using the banking system to advance a climate agenda by pressuring banks to choke-off  select customer or industry access to credit without the necessary statutory predicate established by those  duly elected to establish such a significant policy.    We would take this opportunity to reinforce our longstanding view that bank supervision, and other  purportedly neutral government requirements like disclosures, must not become a means of distorting the  allocation of capital or indirectly implementing unrelated policy preferences. As Environmental, Social and  Governance (ESG) guidance and regulatory proposals proliferate, they are often cast as flexible, non- binding, or targeted to certain segments of the market, while allowing for long transitions. In reality, the  individual and cumulative effects of these agency actions have the potential to be acute, widespread, and  anything but neutral.  There is growing concern from our member banks about the impact those efforts  may have on their continued ability to provide critical financial services to the customers and the  communities they currently serve.      Our basic principle is simple: Banks should be free to lend to, invest in, and generally do business with any  entity or activity that is legal, without government interference. Banks should also be free not to lend,  invest, or otherwise engage so long as they do not violate fair lending or other anti-discrimination laws.  This free-market approach has given this nation the strongest and most resilient financial system in the  world, and the increasing efforts by policymakers from all sides of the political spectrum to intervene in the  intermediation of capital risks undermining that system.       
    Mr. James Sheesley  June 3, 2022  Page 2      The banking industry plays a key role in providing credit and other necessary financial services to  individuals, companies, and communities, and they do that by taking and carefully managing risk.     Regulators should make every effort to ensure banks can serve their communities and to recognize the  unique challenges facing smaller banks, particularly those where the local economy relies on industries and  related suppliers that have become subject to polarized views or are otherwise undergoing transition, such  as the energy sector. It is essential to understand that regulatory initiatives and disclosure requirements  directed at any segment of financial institutions has implications for all others, including community banks,  their counterparties, and the communities they serve. Banks must be able to make legal business decisions  that are appropriate for their customers and communities as market and consumer preferences evolve.     We urge policy makers at all levels of government to be guided by the following key principles:         •  To ensure that communities have the financing needed to remain vibrant, and transition  where needed in an orderly fashion, banks must be free to lend to, invest in, and generally  do business with any entity or activity that is legal.     •  Environmental, social and governance risk should not be considered a separate category of  risk, as it is already embedded in the risks banks currently assess, monitor, and mitigate.      •  Disclosure requirements should not be decoupled from longstanding concepts of materiality or  imposed on banks unnecessarily.  Disclosures are costly, especially for community banks and  they must remain focused on what is necessary to inform business and risk management  decisions, not used to allocate capital or otherwise effectuate broader policy goals.    •  Regulatory efforts to ensure safety and soundness must be appropriately applied and not  used intentionally or unintentionally to reallocate credit or carry out extra prudential goals.    •  Regulators should work together closely to ensure that they do not exceed their mandate  and stray into capital allocation; use consistent definitions; and avoid unintended  consequences.    Thank you for considering our views.  We stand ready to work with you on these issues of vital importance  to our economy.  Howard M. Headlee  President & CEO","The Utah Bankers Association (UBA) expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks. They argue that these principles should not restrict banks from lending to lawful but climate-disfavored industries. UBA opposes using the banking system to advance a climate agenda without statutory backing. They emphasize that bank supervision and disclosures should not distort capital allocation or implement unrelated policies. UBA advocates for a free-market approach, allowing banks to lend to any legal entity without government interference, while adhering to fair lending laws. They stress the importance of banks serving their communities, especially smaller banks reliant on industries like energy. UBA urges policymakers to ensure that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks are integrated into existing risk assessments, and that disclosure requirements remain focused on materiality. They call for regulatory efforts to maintain safety and soundness without reallocating credit or pursuing extra prudential goals. UBA seeks collaboration with regulators to address these issues."

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary  Comments—RIN 3064–ZA32  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429    Submitted via https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register- publications/index.html and Email to: comments@fdic.gov    Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32)    Dear Sir:    On behalf of the undersigned, we respectfully submit the following comments in  response to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)’s Statement of Principles for  Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (“Proposed  Principles”).1 Our comments here echo our comments in response to the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”)’s request for feedback regarding Risk Management:  Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks (“OCC Proposed  Principles”).  We request that the FDIC not adopt the Proposed Principles on the following  bases.     First, the FDIC’s Proposed Principles single out climate-related risk alone for special  treatment, despite more serious threats that include economic downturns, foreign wars, and  public health crises. We disagree that climate-related financial risk is the single gravest threat to  the U.S. banking system and that it needs special treatment. Under the Proposed Principles,  banks will be required to monitor and respond to climate-related risk even when immaterial, to  undertake costly scenario analyses that are not required even for other material risks, and to labor  under a series of requirements that have no role where other risks are concerned. This special  concern for and attention to climate-related risks is irrational. There is no evidence that such  risks stand above other dangers to the banking system or that banks need prompting to consider  such risks.  Climate risk does not need special treatment. With the Proposed Principles, the FDIC    1 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Notice of Proposed Policy Statement; Request For Comment. 2021-62  (April 4, 2022), Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32), Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 64, https://www.fdic.gov/news/board- matters/2022/2022-03-29-notational-fr.pdf.    
    2 ignores a more realistic and holistic approach to risk management in favor or political and social  concerns.      Second, the proposed special treatment of climate-related risk will come with great costs  that the FDIC cannot ignore. Under the Proposed Principles, banks will incur needless additional  operating costs which they will pass on to consumers. Businesses that produce essential goods  like electricity and other energy will find it more difficult to obtain credit. Americans who work  for these businesses will suffer lost jobs. States that produce energy will also be adversely  affected as FDIC “principles” are used by lenders against energy producers. Critical consumer  goods will become more expensive. Home loans in regions allegedly exposed to climate risk  may become harder to obtain. Banks will be encouraged to exclude areas of the economy. The  potential adverse effects of these Proposed Principles on states, businesses, and consumers  cannot be overstated. The FDIC does not and cannot show that the Proposed Principles justify  these immense costs or that they benefit more than a few activists and politicians.     Third, the Proposed Principles will force banks to monitor and account for speculative  and immaterial risks. Banks will be required to spend more on professionals and compliance,  trying to comply with these amorphous principles. Activists daily assert new, speculative harms  from climate change. Under the Proposed Principles, banks may be forced to take each of these  asserted harms seriously, constricting credit and other services to avoid entirely speculative risk.    Fourth, the Proposed Principles are not guidance at all. These will become (and are likely  intended to be) de facto legislative rules and administrative regulations. The Proposed Principles  expand far beyond the scope of current law, bind the FDIC staff, and given the extraordinary  power the staff hold over regulated banks, it binds banks as well. The FDIC should instead  engage in rulemaking and provide the full set of analyses and procedures that must accompany  such proceedings.       Finally, the Proposed Principles also violate the FDIC’s own regulations, in which the  agency committed just a year ago that it would not attempt to issue binding regulations through  guidance. The FDIC’s casual disregard of its own regulations is one more reason the Proposed  Principles, if finalized, would be arbitrary and capricious.    The FDIC should not adopt the Proposed Principles because they will not assist banks to  assess and prepare for all material risks. Instead, the Proposed Principles will adversely affect  states, businesses, and consumers and cause banks to incur more costs. The Proposed Principles  may even weaken federally chartered banks and the national and state banking systems.                
 3 BACKGROUND  On May 20, 2021, President Biden issued the Executive Order on Climate-Related  Financial Risk (“Executive Order”).2   The Executive Order alleges that physical and transition  risks arising from climate change may affect financial institutions.3 On October 15, 2021, the  Administration released “A Roadmap to Build a Climate-Resilient Economy” (“Roadmap”).4  The Roadmap is “a comprehensive, government-wide strategy to measure, disclose, manage, and  mitigate the systemic risks climate change poses to American families, businesses, and the  economy.”5   On December 16, 2021, the OCC issued OCC Bulletin 2021-62 entitled Risk  Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks;  Request for Feedback.6 The bulletin regards the OCC’s “draft principles designed to support the  identification and management of climate-related financial risks by banks with more than $100  billion in total consolidated assets.”7 The bulletin links to a document entitled “ Principles for  Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Bank (“OCC Proposed Principles”).”8   The OCC Proposed Principals include the following general principles: (A) Governance; (B)  Policies, Procedures, and Limits; (C) Strategic Planning; (D) Risk Management; (E) Data, Risk  Measurement, and Reporting; and (F) Scenario Analysis.9 The OCC Proposed Principles also  included the following topics under Management of Risk Areas: (A) Credit Risk; (B) Liquidity  Risk; (C) Other Financial Risk; (D) Operational Risk; (E) Legal/Compliance Risk; and (F) Other  Nonfinancial Risk.10 The State of Utah commented on the OCC Proposed Principals.    The FDIC’s Proposed Principals include the following general principles: (A)  Governance; (B) Policies, Procedures, and Limits; (C) Strategic Planning; (D) Risk  Management; (E) Data, Risk Measurement, and Reporting; and (F) Scenario Analysis.11  The  FDIC’s Proposed Principles also included the following topics under Management of Risk  Areas: (A) Credit Risk; (B) Liquidity Risk; (C) Other Financial Risk; (D) Operational Risk; (E)  Legal/Compliance Risk; and (F) Other Nonfinancial Risk.12  2 Executive Office of the President, Climate-Related Financial Risk, Executive Order 14030, 86 FR 27967 (May 20,  2021), https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/25/2021-11168/climate-related-financial-risk.  3 See id.   4 See FACT SHEET: Biden Administration Roadmap to Build an Economy Resilient to Climate Change Impacts |  The White House (available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/15/fact- sheet-biden-administration-roadmap-to-build-an-economy-resilient-to-climate-change-impacts/ ) (Oct. 14, 2021).  5 See id.  6 OCC Bulletin 2021-62 (December 16, 2021), Risk Management: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Banks; Request for Feedback (Docket Number OCC-2021-0023),  https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2021/bulletin-2021-62.html.     7 See id.    8 See id.  9 See id.  10 See id.  11 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Notice of Proposed Policy Statement; Request For Comment. 2021-62  (April 4, 2022), Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32), Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 64, https://www.fdic.gov/news/board- matters/2022/2022-03-29-notational-fr.pdf.     12 See id. 
    4   The FDIC starts the Introduction section of the Proposed Principles by stating that “The  effects of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy present emerging economic  and financial risks that threaten the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the stability  of the financial system. Financial institutions are likely to be affected by both the physical risks  and transition risks associated with climate change (referred to in these draft principles as  climate-related financial risks).”13 The FDIC differentiates between climate-related physical  risks (e.g., hurricanes, floods, wildfires) and transition risks (e.g., “stresses to certain banks or  sectors”), both of which are referred to in the Proposed Principles “as climate-related financial  risks.”14      The FDIC requested feedback on the Proposed Principles, including fourteen specific  questions.15    DISCUSSION    Proposed Principles Irrationally Single Out Climate-Related Risk for Special Treatment    The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would irrationally single out climate-related risk for  special treatment. Under existing law and regulations, banks are already obligated to achieve  safety and soundness through monitoring and responding to risk from lending, operations,  changes in law and policy, etc.16 And many banks already take climate-related risk into  account.17 The Proposed Principles go a big step further: they single out climate-related risk for  unnecessary special treatment. Regulated banks no longer may simply treat climate-related risk  as any other risk. Instead, banks must specifically focus on climate-related risk in a variety of  ways. For instance:    o The Proposed Principles directs that banks must communicate about climate-related  risks in particular and must specially assign responsibilities for them “throughout the  organization.”18      13 See id. at p. 19508.  14 See id.   15 See id. at pp. 19511 - 19512.  16 See, e.g., 12 C.F.R. pt. 30.  17 See, e.g., Bank of America, “Task force on climate-related financial disclosures report,”  https://about.bankofamerica.com/en/making-an-impact/task-force-on-climate-related-financial-disclosures-report  (“As one of the world’s largest financial institutions, we are committed to ensuring that climate-related risks and  opportunities are properly managed within our business.”).  18 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Notice of Proposed Policy Statement; Request For Comment. 2021-62  (April 4, 2022), Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32), Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 64, https://www.fdic.gov/news/board- matters/2022/2022-03-29-notational-fr.pdf., at p. 19509. 
    5 o Climate-related risk is singled out as the subject of mandatory reporting by bank  management to the board.19    o Climate-related risk is singled out for assessment with regard to “stakeholders’  expectations, the bank’s reputation, and … disadvantaged households and  communities.”20    o Banks must “incorporate climate-related risks into their internal control frameworks,  including internal audit,”21 regardless of whether those risks would qualify for control  or audit coverage under the procedures that the banks have reasonably adopted for  other sorts of risk.    o Bank management must “develop and implement … scenario analysis frameworks”22  for climate-related risks but not for other risks.     o Banks are to “consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and  ongoing monitoring of portfolios.”23    Singling-out climate-related risk is unjustifiable. Climate-related eventualities do not  pose greater risk than, for example, technological disruption, economic downturns, domestic  political changes, foreign conflicts, civic unrest, changing consumer tastes, non-climatic natural  disasters, and public health crises such as the one ravaging the globe today. Even if climate- related risk were among the most important for some banks, there is no reason to believe that is  true for all or most banks. Yet the Proposed Principles singles out only climate-related risk, and  for all large banks.    The Proposed Principles’ defenders may argue that the Proposed Principles only requires  banks to monitor and respond to material climate-related risk, which they ought to do anyway  under current law. This contention must be rejected for three reasons.     First, the Proposed Principles does not limit its commands to material climate-related  risk. For instance, management is directed to “regularly report[]”24 to the board on climate- related financial risks—without regard to whether such risks are regularly material. Similarly,  banks are directed to “consider climate-related financial risks as part of the underwriting and  ongoing monitoring of portfolios”25—without regard to whether those risks are material for  particular portfolios. The result of the Proposed Principles would require banks to give climate- related risks a special place in their consideration without first determining that those risks are    19 See id.  20 See id. at p. 19510.  21 See id. at p. 19510.  22 See id.   23 See id.   24 See id. at p. 19509.  25 See id. at p. 19510. 
    6 material.    Second, the Proposed Principles irrationally singles out climate-related risk for special  procedures that are not required even for other material risks. For instance, the Proposed  Principles demands scenario analysis for climate-related risks.26 But banks are not required to  conduct scenario analysis for other eventualities that pose material, and even greater, risk.    Third, if the Proposed Principles’ only point is that banks should take material climate- related risk into account on the same terms and in the same ways as other risk, it should just say  so, in the form of a simple reminder that the same requirements of assessing material risk with a  view to safety and soundness apply to all kinds of risk.    The largest banks, to which the Proposed Principles are directed, do not need more  prompting to pay attention to climate-related risk as compared to other sorts of risk. Just the  opposite is true. Such a reminder would in fact be unnecessary because the largest banks have  shown a pronounced propensity to engage on issues surrounding climate-related risk.27 Because  no guidance is needed to remind banks and examiners of existing legal requirements, there is no  need for the Proposed Principles, and their issuance would therefore be arbitrary and capricious.    If the FDIC is determined to act in this space, it should prepare guidance for every type of  eventuality that poses a level of risk similar to that assertedly presented by climate change and  should present a reasoned basis for singling out these types of eventualities as presenting higher  degrees of risk than other types. The FDIC’s failure even to ask whether singling out climate- related risk is needed, let alone to answer that question in the affirmative, is the essence of  arbitrary decision-making. The Proposed Principles’ irrationality is exacerbated by the fact that,  as we establish below, its directives are mandatory, although the Proposed Principles would be  irrational even if optional. At the very least, the FDIC should add to the text making clear that  banks are not required to treat climate-related risk differently than any other sort of risk.    FDIC Must Consider the Negative Effects    The Proposed Principles will have considerable negative effects. FDIC must consider  these before adopting the Proposed Principles. A regulation that fails to weigh its benefits against  its costs is irrational.28 Yet the Proposed Principles fails even to identify its costs, let alone assess  whether the benefits it purports to achieve justify them. The Proposed Principles would impose  serious real-world costs on banks, on the businesses to whom they lend, and on American  citizens who depend on those businesses for their livelihoods and for goods and services and on    26 See id.   27 See, e.g., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Sustainability, https://www.jpmorganchase.com/impact/ sustainability/es- commitments; Citigroup, Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures Report 2021,  https://www.citigroup.com/citi/sustainability/data/taskforce-on-climate-related-financial-disclosures-report- 2021.pdf?linkId=148731631; Wells Fargo, Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures,  https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-responsibility/climate-disclosure.pdf.    28 Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743 (2015). 
    7 the banks.        By singling out climate-related risk for special treatment the Proposed Principles would  force banks to implement procedures that are not justified by the prevention of financial harm— as indicated by the fact that the FDIC does not require those procedures for comparable risk of  other types. This may also empower litigation by activists and others seeking to influence or  claim against the banks. This would pointlessly increase operating costs for banks, which will  pass on these costs to customers. All these costs would be most heavily borne by small  businesses, who will more often lack the resources to absorb an increase in the cost of credit or  to modify their operations to cater to the demands of banks to avoid activities that generate  climate-related risk.    By requiring banks to treat climate-related risk more sensitively than risks of other types,  the Proposed Principles would drive banks to assemble portfolios that are inefficient. Indeed, by  driving banks to assemble portfolios weighted toward businesses that putatively represent low  climate risk, the Proposed Principles would make portfolios less diverse and hence will increase  risk in the banking system. Moreover, while the Proposed Principles purport to only target large  banks they will inevitably affect community banks and credit unions.    Banks would be encouraged to exclude areas of the economy.  By singling out climate- related risk for special caution in the provision of credit, the Proposed Principles would prompt  banks to deny credit, or offer credit on worse terms, to businesses that might be alleged to pose  climate-related risk.  This includes businesses such as mining and electric power companies, as  well as others that may be alleged to be at risk from possible changes in law or public opinion  regarding climate change.  Because the Proposed Principles directs banks to consider climate- related risks to “the bank’s reputation,”29 banks would be forced to consider whether loan  applicants are in favor with green activists or are green enough. Banks may (in good faith or  otherwise) interpret the Proposed Principles to require that they lend only to businesses that  make certain green commitments (net zero emissions by 2050, etc.). Businesses that are accused  of or perceived as harming the climate may find it hard to obtain credit and/or reasonable loan  terms. Banks may even believe they must refuse standard transactional services, such as banking  accounts, to businesses that are in disfavor with green activists.    Businesses that operate in regions that may be alleged to be exposed to climate risk, such  as coastal or forested areas, would also find it harder and more expensive to obtain credit.  Indeed, the Proposed Principles suggests that banks should “determine … lending limits” by  reference to geographic location.30 This harm would extend to states whose economies rely on  energy generation.     29 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Notice of Proposed Policy Statement; Request For Comment. 2021-62  (April 4, 2022), Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32), Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 64, https://www.fdic.gov/news/board- matters/2022/2022-03-29-notational-fr.pdf., at p. 19511.  30 See id.  
    8   The Proposed Principles will also hurt American citizens. As credit for businesses posing  “climate risk” dries up, the Americans who work for those businesses or for other businesses  who depend on them for goods or services would find their livelihoods in peril. Americans  would find it harder to start small businesses alleged to pose such risks. Further, under the  Proposed Principles, Americans who happen to live in areas that the banks may believe are at  higher climate risk would find it harder to get home and business loans. And Americans would  face higher charges for essential goods like electricity as the cost of credit for such goods  increases. Americans would also suffer as towns—especially in rural America—lose businesses  on which they depend for jobs that sustain a viable community life. Americans would further  suffer from the broader societal risks inherent in the green policies that the Proposed Principles  are meant to further. These policies risk creating economic downturns, undermining grid  reliability, and impeding American trade competitiveness, to name just a few. But the Proposed  Principles do not even acknowledge, let alone attempt to fathom, these risks, or to offset them  against the asserted risks it addresses.    The Proposed Principles fail to assess not just costs, but also benefits. It claims that its  approach will enhance bank safety and soundness, but it does not establish a baseline of current  bank practices with respect to climate-related risk or show how the approach taken in the  Proposed Principles differ from that approach. Without such information, it is impossible to  know whether the Proposed Principles mark any advance over current levels of safety and  soundness and hence whether it is necessary. A regulation aiming at a problem is “highly  capricious if that problem does not exist.”31    Any rational approach to climate-related risk requires a robust cost-benefit analysis  relying on rigorous economic, industrial, and consumer studies. But among its many questions,  the Proposed Principles fail to ask about the costs and benefits of its mandates. If the FDIC  mistakenly elects to continue with this rulemaking, it should before finalization issue a request  for information seeking the data it needs to assess and compare costs and benefits, then give  careful heed to that data in any eventual finalization.    Proposed Principles Force Banks to Account for Immaterial and Speculative Risk    The Proposed Principles force banks to monitor and account even for speculative and  immaterial risks. Despite having a stated purpose of helping banks manage risk arising from  climate change, the Proposed Principles do not explain the nature and scope of that risk, leaving  banks to feel their way blindly on this decisive question, or to guess what will best keep them out  of regulatory audits and litigation.      Predictions about the physical risks of climate change vary wildly, ranging from  increasing numbers of hurricanes and wildfires to destruction from climate-driven great-power    31 Alltel Corp. v. FCC, 838 F.2d 551, 561 (D.C. Cir. 1988). 
    9 conflict or even more speculative claims.32 And predictive climate science is in its infancy. The  Proposed Principles admit that climate “[d]ata, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and  reporting continue to evolve at a rapid pace.”33 For these reasons the obstacles to understanding  the risk of various climate eventualities, especially decades into the future, are immense. Yet the  Proposed Principles fail to offer principles by which banks can determine which asserted  physical risks are realistic in the FDIC’s view and therefore should be considered.    Further, the Proposed Principles demand that banks monitor and account for risk arising  from climate-driven changes to the legal framework. But regulatory and (especially) legislative  action is notoriously difficult to predict, and the Proposed Principles do not offer any means by  which banks may weed out probable from speculative future regulatory and legislative  developments or any safe harbors on which banks may rely in making judgments about such  future government action. Faced with the Proposed Principles’ demand that banks monitor and  respond to climate-related risk and the FDIC’s refusal to explain which sorts of alleged risk are  of concern, banks will have no choice but to err on the side of caution. Rather than run afoul of  the FDIC, they will take an unwarrantably and unpredictably expansive view of the risks of  climate change, exacerbating the harms to the banking system, small businesses, and Americans  discussed in the preceding section. Indeed, the Proposed Principles sanction this approach: it  urges banks to adopt “measures of conservatism” in the face of uncertainty.34    For this reason, too, the FDIC should not finalize this Proposed Principles. The FDIC “is  an independent agency created by Congress to maintain stability and public confidence in the  nation's financial system. To accomplish this mission, the FDIC insures deposits; examines and  supervises financial institutions for safety, soundness, and consumer protection; makes large and  complex financial institutions resolvable; and manages receiverships.”35 If the FDIC does choose  to finalize the Proposed Principles then it should make clear that banks may form their own  judgments about the likelihood and magnitude of various asserted climate-driven eventualities  and that the FDIC will not second-guess those judgments.     This is Rulemaking, Not Guidance    The Proposed Principles are legislative rules masquerading as guidance. The FDIC must  treat it as a legislative rule. The “hallmark of legislative rules” is “[e]xpanding the footprint of a  regulation by imposing new requirements, rather than simply interpreting the legal norms    32 See Elizabeth Kolbert, “Three Scenarios for the Future of Climate Change,” New Yorker (Oct. 5, 2020).  33 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Notice of Proposed Policy Statement; Request For Comment. 2021-62  (April 4, 2022), Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32), Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 64, https://www.fdic.gov/news/board- matters/2022/2022-03-29-notational-fr.pdf., at p. 19510.  34 See id, at p. 19511.  35 https://www.fdic.gov/about/ 
    10  Congress or the agency itself has previously created.”36    The Proposed Principles expand the regulatory footprint in two ways. First, it decides  once and for all that climate-related financial risk poses a graver risk to bank safety and  soundness than other sorts of risk and therefore warrants special treatment. Regulated banks are  no longer free to make their own prudential assessment in this area, as they do in others; they  must act as though climate-related risk is of especially great concern. Second, the Proposed  Principles establish several concrete new requirements for regulated banks. See supra.    Neither of the above represents a mere interpretation of existing legal duties.37 Indeed,  the Proposed Principles do not cite a statute or regulation. It appears to deduce the new  requirements from the general duty of safety and soundness,38 but that general standard neither  singles out climate-related risk for special treatment nor creates the particular duties the  Proposed Principles demand.     The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would have binding force. The Proposed Principles  bind banks to single out climate-related risk as an area of special concern. The Proposed  Principles declare the FDIC’s position that climate-related financial risk implicates safety and  soundness in an especially serious way.39 Banks are no longer free to reach their own  conclusions on this issue. This determination from the FDIC controls the actions of the financial  institutions that it regulates. The Proposed Principles leave the FDIC and the financial  institutions no opportunity for reaching different conclusions about climate-related risk; indeed,  the Proposed Principles make clear that the staff’s “supervisory expectations” will be shaped by  the framework offered in the Proposed Principles.40 The FDIC must therefore require the  financial institutions they supervise to treat climate-related risk as the Proposed Principles  demands.    Because regulated banks know this, they must accept the Proposed Principles’  determination about climate-related risk if they do not wish for adverse action by their  examiners. This is why the Proposed Principles simply assume that banks will “incorporate[e]    36 Iowa League of Cities v. EPA, 711 F.3d 844, 873 (8th Cir. 2013); see also Gen. Motors Corp. v.

    11  these principles [of the Proposed Principles] into their risk management systems.”41 It does not  even consider whether banks might decline to accept this purported “guidance.”    The Proposed Principles therefore resemble the EPA guidance found binding in  Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 208 F.3d 1015 (D.C. Cir. 2000), and Natural Resources Defense  Council v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311 (D.C. Cir. 2011), both of which committed agency staff—and  therefore by extension the public regulated by those staff—to the positions taken by guidance.   Indeed, the Proposed Principles presents the concerns in these cases in an aggravated form, for  the FDIC’s supervisory power is broad and powerful.   The Proposed Principles also bind banks to implement its particular demands. The  Proposed Principles states that an “effective risk governance framework is essential to a bank’s  safe and sound operation,”42 and that such governance “includes” certain specific climate-related  measures such as “assigning climate-related financial risk responsibilities throughout the  organization.” Per the Proposed Principles, regulated banks that treat climate-related risk like  other risks, rather than singling it out for, e.g., “assign[ment] … throughout the organization,”  will fail at an “essential” element of safety and soundness.    Similarly, the Proposed Principles often assert that banks “should” comply with its  demands. While this word can sometimes merely recommend, here the Proposed Principles make  clear that banks “should” undertake the demanded measures if they want to remain safe and  sound—and they are required by law to remain safe and sound. The guidance does not disclaim  that it is binding or anywhere inform banks or the public that it does not bind.    The FDIC should therefore admit that the Proposed Principles, if finalized, would  constitute a legislative rule subject to the procedural requirements of the Administrative  Procedures Act (APA). The FDIC should withdraw the Proposed Principles and (if it mistakenly  chooses to proceed with the rulemaking) should reissue it with the full set of findings and  analyses that ordinarily accompany a rulemaking. Further, the FDIC should explain why a  binding rulemaking, rather than optional guidance, is appropriate in these circumstances.  Nothing in the Proposed Principles addresses this question, but a rulemaking that fails to engage  whether a rulemaking (rather than guidance) is necessary at all is arbitrary and capricious.    As Guidance, the Proposed Principles Violate FDIC Regulations     The Proposed Principles, if finalized, would violate the FDIC’s own regulations because  they would create a binding rule through purported guidance. The FDIC adopted the Interagency    41 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Notice of Proposed Policy Statement; Request For Comment. 2021-62  (April 4, 2022), Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32), Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 64, https://www.fdic.gov/news/board- matters/2022/2022-03-29-notational-fr.pdf., at p. 19511.  42 See id, at p. 19509 (emphasis added). 
    12  Statement Clarifying the Role of Supervisory Guidance as a rule.43  The FDIC issued a  regulation providing that “supervisory guidance does not have the force and effect of law.”44 In  the preamble to that regulation, the FDIC explained that “examples … included in supervisory  guidance (including guidance that goes through public comment) are not binding on  institutions,” but are “intended to be illustrative.”45     Yet, as explained above, the Proposed Principles if finalized would create a binding rule,  and the examples it gives of practices banks must undertake to protect against climate-related  risk are mandatory rather than illustrative.      Moreover, the Proposed Principles if finalized would be arbitrary and capricious, because  the creation of a binding rule through guidance would constitute an unexplained departure from  the agency’s own past practice, as codified in the agency’s own regulation on guidance.46 That  the Proposed Principles passed through a comment period changes nothing because the FDIC’s  rule on guidance commits the agency not to issue binding guidance even through notice and  comment.    CONCLUSION    The FDIC should not adopt the Proposed Principles. Climate-related financial risk is not  the gravest threat to our banking system and should not be elevated to that status over economic  downturns, foreign wars, or public health crises. The direct costs of compliance and indirect cost  to businesses and consumers may be devastating, increasing already high inflation but curtailing  credit to the energy sector and further burdening low-income Americans. The Proposed  Principles favor and elevate social and political issues to the detriment of states, businesses,  consumers, and our banking system.   Moreover, the Proposed Principles are labeled guidance, but will be treated and enforced  as rules. The FDIC should withdraw the Proposed Principles and proceed with rulemaking.

CFA advocates for legislative and administrative  action to address the severe threats of climate change and the resulting serious economic,  environmental, and public health consequences. Climate change presents substantial risks to  financial institutions, our financial system, and our economy, and many financial institutions will  benefit from clear, holistic guidance on assessing those risks. We support this important step  toward addressing climate-related financial risks in the banking system and urge the FDIC to  meaningfully address all stakeholder concerns and questions, strengthen these draft principles,  and develop final principles that adequately address the existential and severe threat that climate  change poses to our financial system.     CFA is an association of non-profit consumer organizations that was established in 1968 to  advance the consumer interest through research, advocacy, and education. Over 250 of these  groups participate in the federation and govern it through their representatives on the  organization’s Board of Directors. Our comments are based on CFA’s many years of experience  advocating for consumer protections in the financial marketplace, protective financial and bank  regulation, and affordable and fair access to financial services.      
      2  1. Climate Change is an Existential Threat to Our Financial System That the FDIC  and Other Federal Regulators Must Address      The FDIC is an independent agency tasked by Congress to maintain stability and public  confidence of our nation’s financial system, by insuring, regulating, and supervising more than  5,000 banks and savings associations chartered by the states or by the Office of the Comptroller  of the Currency (OCC). The agency’s work is extremely vital to the nation’s financial system  and greater economy, and it works closely with a variety of regulatory agencies to fulfill its  mandate. The FDIC plays an important role in identifying and reducing financial risks. As the  Federal Reserve,1 the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC),2 and the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have indicated,3 climate change poses significant risks  and challenges to our economy, financial system, and financial stability. It is critically important  for the agency, and other federal financial regulators, to assume a leading role in mitigating the  risks posed by climate change.      Climate change is already affecting the United States with more extreme weather and natural  disasters,4 increasing surface temperature,5 and rising sea level,6 and these sweeping changes  show no sign of easing.7 For example, analysis of satellite images dating back to 1979 shows that  climate change is making hurricanes more intense and destructive. Now hurricanes are more  likely to develop into a Category 3 storm or higher, with winds of at least 110 miles per hour.8  Additionally, the U.S. Forest Service estimates that the fire season is two and a half months  longer than in the 1970s, and wildfires are burning more acres than ever before.9 In 2021, over  40% of Americans lived in counties affected by climate disasters, which included flooding,    1 “Climate Change Is a Source of Financial Risk.” By Glenn D.

      3  mudslides, power outages, wildfires, drought, and heat waves.10 These natural disasters cause not  only loss of life and property, but also significant economic costs – NOAA reports the U.S. has  witnessed 310 weather and climate disasters since 1980 with damage or costs of $1 billion or  more.11     Further, FSOC recently identified climate change as an emerging and increasing threat to  financial stability. The Council stated that by collecting and publicly disclosing data,  incorporating analysis of climate-related risks into supervisory and regulatory functions, and  promoting disclosures of climate-related risk, “financial regulators can both promote the  resilience of the financial system and help it support an orderly, economy-wide transition toward  the goal of net-zero emissions.”12     The risks to our financial system require further action beyond market forces and competition.  Strong regulations are needed to ensure that financial institutions adequately assess climate- related financial risks and are properly prepared for climate-related impacts, and that consumers  are sufficiently informed of how climate change will affect their financial well-being. Although  these principles are an important first step, they will only apply to a handful of regulated entities  as the majority of institutions regulated by the FDIC are community banks and savings  associations. These community banks and savings associations are critical to providing banking  access for low- and moderate-income consumers (LMI), who will be disproportionately affected  by climate change as discussed below. We implore the FDIC to encourage smaller financial  institutions to consider these risks and prepare for them, since these entities are more likely to  feel the brunt of climate change’s effects. Of course, principles for smaller institutions should be  tailored to their size and circumstances.    Further, the FDIC must also encourage the other financial regulators, including the National  Credit Union Association (NCUA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), to  address climate-related financial risks through their regulatory and supervisory actions as well.  Finally, the FDIC should coordinate its actions with the OCC, which recently issued its own  Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Banks.13      10 “More than 40% of Americans Live in Countries Hit by Climate Disaster in 2021.” By Sarah Kaplan and Andrew Ba Tran.

      4  2. Climate Change Will Disproportionately Hurt Low- and Moderate-Income  Consumers and Communities of Color    Low- and moderate-income (LMI) consumers, communities of color, and other financially  vulnerable Americans are especially susceptible to the effects of climate change and climate- related financial risks.    These consumers already feel the brunt of predatory financial practices, discriminatory policies,  and systems that perpetuate existing disparities. In addition, these consumers have less access to  safe and affordable credit or traditional financial services and therefore, are more likely to be  unbanked and make use of nonbank financial services such as money orders, check-cashing  services, and payday loans.14     Among banked consumers, Black and Latino consumers are more likely than white consumers to  have incurred overdraft fees15 and are already harmed by lack of oversight and predatory  practices. Further, although 18% of consumers reported overdrafting an account in December  2021, these rates are higher for underbanked consumers and those experiencing income  volatility.16     High interest, short-term lenders specifically target and exploit Black communities– Black adults  are more likely than white adults to live near payday lenders and pawn shops.17 Although credit  cards can be a more affordable form of credit, Black consumers find it more difficult to obtain  them.18 Additionally, Black and Hispanic households find it more difficult to gain approval for  conventional mortgages, and when they are approved they tend to pay higher interest rates.19  This is partly due to the use of credit reports and scores, which both reflect and perpetuate large  racial disparities and have a very real impact on consumers’ abilities to pay their bills.20 Finally,  these systems and practices exacerbate the racial wealth gap–  in 2019, the typical white family    14 “How America Banks: Household Use of Banking and Financial Services.” Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

      5  had five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic family and eight times the wealth of a typical  Black family.     These consumers are also particularly vulnerable to the greatest impacts of climate change and  will be the least able to prepare for and recover from the effects of climate change, including  health, labor, and financial costs. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently reported  consumers of color and low-income consumers face disproportionate and unequal risks of the  impacts of climate change, including the impacts that air quality and extreme temperature will  have on health and labor hours, property damage and loss, and traffic delays due to island and  coastal flooding.21 Consumers of color are most likely to live in areas with the highest projected  impacts of climate changes.22 In addition, those consumers with low-income or no high school  degree are more likely to currently live in areas with the highest projected losses of labor hours.23  Therefore, consumers of color and low-income consumers are disproportionately at risk to the  highest health, labor, and property impacts of climate change.     Further, these consumers also bear the brunt of financial instability and crises. As we learned  from the 2008 financial crisis, the effects of financial crises are disproportionately felt by LMI24  consumers25 and communities of color.26 The result is a K-shaped recovery– following a  recession, different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes–  resulting in exacerbation of the existing wealth, homeownership, wage, and employment gaps.      Climate change and the associated financial risks will disproportionately harm consumers of  color and low-income consumers. Financial institutions cannot be idle spectators to the  anticipated effects climate change will have on our financial system and the consumers they  serve.      The FDIC must be aggressive and proactive to address the ways in which financial institution  activity might be fueling climate change and ensure that financial institutions are adequately  prepared for and addressing climate-related financial risks. Further, the FDIC should pay  particular attention to the ways in which vulnerable consumers will be disproportionately  affected by climate-related risks; and through supervision of regulated entities, monitor how  safety and soundness issues affect consumers of color, low-income consumers, and other    21 “Climate Change and Social Vulnerability in the United States: A Focus on Six Impacts.” Environmental Protection Agency.

      6  financially vulnerable consumers; ensure that physical banking access is expanded and not  consolidated; and make certain that their activities are driving the financial stability of all  consumers they serve.     In addition, CFA welcomes the FDIC’s recent announcement to overhaul the Community  Reinvestment Act,27 and encourages the agency to strengthen and finalize its recent proposal to  address the impact of climate-related financial risks on LMI consumers and communities of  color.    3. CFA Recommends the Following:    In order for financial institutions to prepare for climate change and the associated risks, they  must adopt good governance strategies, apply transparency, accountability, responsibility, and  fairness in their business activities, and the FDIC must facilitate these changes through  mandatory requirements. Below are several recommendations that the FDIC and financial  institutions should take regarding climate-related financial risks.     The FDIC Should Enact Mandatory Requirements for Considering Climate-Related Financial  Risk     The FDIC’s principles for climate-related financial risk management provide an important  framework for reducing risks and preparing for worst-case scenarios. But the principles are  dependent upon the financial institutions recognizing their significance and fully embracing  them; if financial institutions are reluctant to implement the principles, they are of limited use.  The FDIC should therefore institute mandatory requirements to ensure large institutions are  adequately addressing climate-related financial risk and incorporating the costs of carbon  emissions into their financial strategies. For example, the FDIC should require greater capital  requirements to counter climate-related financial risk28 and in order to do that, climate change  needs to be included in economic and financial forecasts and assessments of systemic risk.29     The FDIC Should Extend Principles to Smaller Financial Institutions, For Which the Proposed  Principles Do Not Apply       27 FDIC, OCC, FRB, “Joint Proposal to Strengthen and Modernize Community Reinvestment Act Regulations,” (May 5, 2022)  https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22018.html.  28 “Addressing Climate-Related Financial Risk Through Bank Capital Requirements.” Center for American Progress.

      7  Further, as mentioned above, these principles will only apply to a small handful of regulated  entities as the majority of institutions regulated by the FDIC are community banks and savings  associations. Community banks and savings associations are critical to providing banking access  for LMI consumers, who will be disproportionately affected by climate change. The FDIC  should extend these principles to smaller banks and institutions, and these principles for smaller  institutions should be tailored to their size and circumstances.    The FDIC Should Work with Other Federal Agencies to Comprehensively Address Climate- Related Financial Risk    Interagency cooperation is essential to reducing climate-related financial risk and ensuring that  financial institutions are prepared for its adverse, multifaceted impacts. The FDIC should work  with the following organizations on various projects:     ● The FDIC should cooperate with the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to create a national  effort to develop and implement mitigation and resilience standards and strategies to  reduce exposure to climate change-driven risk.30 The effort should include how financial  institutions and insurance companies will contribute to such mitigation as part of their  overall work. FIO and the FDIC should also develop workstreams on insurance industry  underwriting practices with climate impacts, how available and affordable insurance is  and the likely impacts of climate change on that affordability and develop federal and  regional strategies to meet expanding capital needs for reinsuring major catastrophes and  natural disasters.   ● The FDIC should coordinate with other deposit institution regulators, the Federal  Reserve, the OCC, the National Credit Union Association (NCUA), and state banking  regulators, as well as the market regulators, Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA),  Office of Financial Research, and the CFPB, which has established a climate working  group.31 Together with these other regulators, the FDIC can require that all financial  institutions publicly disclose any assets that contribute to climate change, mitigate  climate risks to their portfolios, and provide credit, physical banking access, and  necessary financial services to communities facing the worst impacts of climate change.   ● The FDIC should further cooperate with other agencies, including but not limited to the  EPA, Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA), and CFPB to holistically  address the impact of climate change on consumer financial well-being and security. In  2021, the CFPB established a climate working group to better assess the impact of  climate change on consumer financial well-being and on the markets for consumer  financial products and services. The working group will also examine the adverse    30 “Re: FIO Insurance Sector and Climate-Related Financial Risks.” Consumer Federation of America. November 15, 2021.

      8  impacts of climate change of historically underserved and disadvantaged communities  and households–an obvious area of possible cooperation with the FDIC.32    Financial Institutions Should Take a Holistic View of Climate Risk and Stakeholder Exposure    In CFA’s aforementioned comments to the OCC, we discussed the importance of stakeholder  exposure to climate risk and regulator’s role in addressing it.33 These concepts may directly  apply to significantly fewer of the FDIC’s regulated entities, but they are still important  considerations, and the core concepts may still be relevant in the FDIC context as well.    The principles proposed by the FDIC advance critical considerations for regulated institutions.  As such, they should be adopted and built upon with a broader view of climate-related financial  risk management. Due to the size, organizational complexity, and economic footprint of our  banking system, financial institutions are unique among industry sectors in the context of climate  change. Financial institutions are exposed to the climate-related risks of their own financial  entanglements, and by extension their own stakeholders are exposed to the same. Because the  physical and socioeconomic footprint of financial institutions is so expansive,34 regulation of  them should be tailored to capture the unique risks that they present, and this reality should be  reflected in the FDIC’s principles for climate-related risk management and subsequent  regulations. On an institutional level, the complexities of financial institutions’ climate exposure  risk should also be reflected in risk management governance, policies and procedures, and public  disclosures.     As the FDIC develops principles and subsequent regulations for financial institutions, the view  must be that a financial institution’s stakeholders include more than just physical assets, balance  sheets, and shareholders. For these financial institutions, and as discussed throughout this  comment letter, the impacts of both good climate risk management and less-than-good climate  risk management will have significant downstream impacts, and this will be especially true for  those communities that are already the most vulnerable, both to the physical impacts of climate  change and the financial impacts of instability in the financial system. As the FDIC’s proposed  principles state, “The board and management should also consider climate-related financial risk  impacts on stakeholders’ expectations, the institution’s reputation, and LMI and other  disadvantaged households and communities, including physical harm or access to bank products  and services.” This statement should be a forethought for oversight, rather than an afterthought.       32 Id.   33 CFA Comments to OCC re Climate-Related Financial Risk, (Feb. 2022).  34 “Are Banks Prepared for Climate Change?” Boston Common Asset Management., (2015). Available at  https://bostoncommonasset.com/Membership/Apps/ICCMSViewReport_Input_App.ashx?IX_OB=None&IX_mId=18&IX_RD= Y&ObjectId=731308, (“Banks are tied to every market sector through their lending practices, making them uniquely vulnerable  to climate-related risk.”). 
      9  The FDIC’s RFI asks, “How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial  risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?” This  question may or may not seek to impart the same meaning of the word “material” as does the  anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws,35 but hopefully not. To do so would unfortunately  lead to a view that may dangerously narrow the climate-related considerations of banks’ risk  management strategies and those which the FDIC should incorporate into its oversight.  Importantly, it is difficult to identify an industry sector that has more vulnerabilities or touch  points to climate change as do financial institutions,36 and to limit consideration and/or  management of these unique vulnerabilities by way of a narrowed materiality analysis would be  dangerous for financial institutions, their stakeholders, and the financial system writ large. The  climate risks of one institution are likely to seed climate risks for many others as well, and a  narrowed view of material climate risks may therefore undermine the systemic view required of  the FDIC.37      Appropriately, the RFI asks, “How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be  augmented to better capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?”  Here again, the RFI seems to appreciate the complex, multifaceted impacts that climate change  poses for financial institutions. As such, the FDIC should certainly consider information that is  financially material to regulated entities’ direct stakeholders, but only as one piece of the larger  constellation of climate change risks that should be actively managed by financial institutions,  and should be incorporated into their risk governance and strategic planning, and also codified in  the FDIC’s safety and soundness oversight and regulation.    Financial Institutions Should Gather Expertise and Authority for Climate Scientists    Financial institutions should possess substantial expertise on climate change and its impacts,  both physical and financial. Knowledge about climate change is essential for making informed  decisions and yet, too many financial institutions are ignorant of this subject. Financial  institutions should be required to have climate scientists as members of their corporations and for  these scientists to be given resources and authority so they can evaluate the impacts of rising sea  levels, more frequent extreme weather disasters, and other consequences of a warming plant.  These positions should be substantive and possess the power to make real reforms, as opposed to  surface level “greenwashing”— conveying a false impression or providing misleading    35 “Comment Letter Re: Public Input on Climate Change Disclosures.” Consumer Federation of America.

Bank boards and  management must also understand climate-related financial exposures and the vulnerability of  their institutions.     A few banks, including the European Central Bank and Lombard Odier, are competing to hire  experts in order to gain knowledge and decarbonize their portfolios and loan books.38 Mounting  evidence shows that climate change poses a serious threat to price stability and financial systems,  and some institutions feel they require greater expertise.     Although CFA appreciates Acting Comptroller Hsu’s identification of the following questions  that bank boards should be able to adequately address, all financial institutions, including those  regulated by the FDIC, should impart their answers and work plans to address these concerns  with their regulators:     ● What is our long-term exposure to climate change, and how manageable is this exposure?   ● Which counterparties, sectors, or locales need our heightened attention and focus?   ● How vulnerable are our data centers and other critical services to extreme weather?   ● What can we do to position ourselves to seize opportunities from climate change?39       Financial Institutions Should Divest from Climate Change Exacerbating Projects    The FDIC must ensure that public facing promises made by financial institutions to divest from  climate change exacerbating projects are met, and that through investment, financial institutions  are not further contributing to many of the industries that worsen climate change. For example,  many banks finance activities that further fuel climate change and are more likely to harm  vulnerable consumers such as natural gas extraction, coal mines, and coal-fired power plants, and  oil extraction and pipelines. From 2016 to 2020 the world’s 60 largest commercial and  investment banks invested $3.8 trillion into fossil fuels.40      Financial institutions must stop funding fossil fuel projects such as oil pipelines, natural gas-fired  power plants, and coal-fired power plants, which emit greenhouse gas emissions and increase  climate change. These projects lead to stronger hurricanes and wildfires, drought and heat waves,  more frequent and extensive flooding, unusually hot or cold weather patterns, and rising sea  levels, which lead to massive financial and human costs, as well as destruction of both personal    38 “Climate Scientists Swap Fieldwork for Finance.” By Simon Jessop, Carolyn Cohn, and Iain Withers.

Therefore, the result is a self-fulfilling cycle of banks  financing climate change, which contributes to financial instability while raising costs and  creating greater exposure for the most vulnerable consumers.     Despite making public facing promises to invest in clean, sustainable financing, many banks  have been resistant to divest from fossil fuels.41 These actions are necessary in order to reduce  climate change and transition to a lower-carbon economy. Financial institutions must stop  financing new fossil fuel projects and expanding existing projects. Further, they should start  phasing out existing insurance and funding for them unless there are exceptional circumstances.     Financial Institutions Should Prioritize Long-Term Thinking and Analysis    Traditionally banks and other financial institutions have prioritized shorter time horizons, profits,  and immediate risks. While they examine past records and behavior, they make decisions based  on immediate and near-future consequences. But investors, market participants, financial  institutions, and regulators all must consider the effects of climate change and its impact on risks  over the long term.     In comparison, insurance companies aim to distribute risk so that individuals and individual  companies do not have to bear the full brunt of losses, by selling a diverse set of policies across a  variety of markets. However, large natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires can destroy  or impact large areas and overwhelm insurers, possibly creating compounding losses. Climate  change is making these cases more frequent, yet many insurers are underestimating the risks  involved.42 Banks and other financial institutions must prioritize long term planning and legacies  over short term profits. They should consider circumstances and climate over the next twenty,  thirty, or even fifty years, and make the necessary preparations.     4. Conclusion     The FDIC’s draft principles are an excellent beginning to addressing climate related financial  risk. CFA urges that they be strengthened and adopted as quickly as possible. The banking  industry, its regulators, and all consumers have a lot at stake, yet the burden of climate change  and the financial risks will be disproportionately carried by consumers of color, LMI, and other  vulnerable consumers. Climate change will impact every area of the financial sector and create  dramatic risks, raising costs for everyone unless sweeping measures are adopted.        41 Id.  42 “The $5 Trillion Insurance Industry Faces a Reckoning.

Please contact Rachel Gittleman  (rgittleman@consumerfed.org) with any questions.","The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) submitted comments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regarding its draft principles for managing climate-related financial risks in large financial institutions. CFA supports the FDIC's initiative, emphasizing the existential threat climate change poses to the financial system and the need for strong regulations. They urge the FDIC to address stakeholder concerns, strengthen the draft principles, and extend them to smaller institutions. CFA highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on low- and moderate-income consumers and communities of color, advocating for mandatory requirements for financial institutions to assess and manage climate risks. They recommend interagency cooperation, divestment from fossil fuels, and long-term planning to mitigate climate risks. CFA also stresses the importance of transparency, accountability, and the inclusion of climate scientists in financial institutions.

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention: Comments—RIN 3064–ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  550 17th Street NW,   Washington, DC 20429      Re: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions; RIN 3064–ZA32    Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,    The Wisconsin Bankers Association (WBA) is the largest financial trade association in  Wisconsin, representing nearly 200 state and nationally chartered banks, savings and loan  associations, and savings banks. WBA appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) notice of proposed policy statement of principles for  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions.    FDIC requested comment on draft principles proposed with the objective of providing a high- level framework for safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks.  The draft principles are targeted for the largest financial institutions, being those with over $100  billion in total consolidated assets. Within its proposal, FDIC has suggested that the principles  are intended to support efforts by large financial institutions to focus on key aspects of climate- related financial risk management.    Financial risks, physical risks, and transition risks already exist within the banking system and  Wisconsin banks already adequately manage these risks using long-standing and time-tested  credit-based risk management practices, as appropriate. These existing principles have already  withstood decades of natural disasters, pandemics, and climate-related events. The addition of  regulator-imposed agenda-based principles worsens these risks by disrupting already  established frameworks.      Although FDIC’s statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management only  applies to large financial institutions, WBA remains concerned that smaller-sized banks and  their local communities will be negatively impacted. WBA is concerned that the proposed  principles will create pressures which in turn require large financial institutions to “de-risk” their  loan portfolios and as a result avoid lawful but climate disfavored customers or industries,  excluding them from the financial system. WBA believes these effects will trickle down to  community banks.    WBA is further concerned that FDIC’s principles, although designed for the largest banks, would  affect community banks through the resulting impacts upon the financial sector, be indirectly  expected as best practices, or even be applied directly through future rulemaking. This is 
    concerning as the steep expense, complex models, governance requirements, and specialized  expertise that would be necessary for community banks would be cost and resource prohibitive.    Given current tendencies in the climate-risk area, WBA also requests that FDIC ensure that any  finalized principles on data, risk measurement, and reporting do not require, or otherwise imply  any requirement for community banks to gather climate data directly from their customers,  vendors, and other third parties. Consumers and small businesses (many of which do not have,  and are unable to collect, sophisticated climate data) should never be compelled to produce  climate data as a condition for obtaining basic banking services.    WBA recommends that FDIC focus on empirical information such as through studies and  currently existing banking data in developing guidance. Specifically, WBA encourages FDIC to  utilize this information to examine current risk management frameworks, and first determine  what, if any, gaps exist specific to climate-related financial risk rather than building new  frameworks from the ground up. From there, FDIC can better consider the degree to which  climate-related financial risk may or may not actually threaten the safety and soundness of the  financial system, and what, if any, guidance principles might be most effective.    Furthermore, WBA urges FDIC to take all reasonable and appropriate measures to ensure any  principles for climate-related financial risk management, if finalized, do not facilitate the  exclusion of lawful but climate-disfavored industries from the banking system. FDIC must  ensure it has adequately, and empirically examined the impact of finalizing these draft  principles.    Conclusion    WBA appreciates the opportunity to comment on FDIC’s statement of principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions. WBA emphasizes that strong  credit-based risk management frameworks are currently in place by Wisconsin banks, and  strenuously cautions against finalization of any regulator-imposed agenda-based principles  which would potentially disrupt this robust, existing risk management. If finalized, any principles  must not, directly or indirectly, affect community banks, and must not result in excluding lawful  but climate disfavored customers or industries from the financial system.    We appreciate your consideration of these comments.

As a leading provider  of climate risk data and analytics to the global investment community, MSCI has collected  climate-related and environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures from thousands of  companies globally for over two decades and developed tools to assist investors in their analysis  of climate and ESG risk to their portfolios. The systematic consideration of climate factors in the  risk management process of banks and financial institutions is still at an early stage.    For the purposes of our response to the Request for Comment, we have analyzed how listed U.S.  based banks compare to the global sector average on climate-risk management practice from  our Financing Environmental Impact Key Issue ratings methodology for banks/lenders.2 Our  research illustrates that the U.S. based banks lag the remainder of the global banking sector on  selected indicators related to ESG and climate risk management practices. Please refer to Annex  1 attached, for detailed findings.    For the purposes of this submission, we comment in more detail in Annex 2 on those matters  where we believe MSCI’s expertise and experience to be most relevant. As a provider of climate  risk data and analytics, we have an interest in the proposals and have the following general  comments:    1. Enhancing the scope of banks covered. The physical and transition risks associated with  climate change have the potential to impact banks of all sizes. Smaller banks with a less  diversified portfolio and higher regional exposure may be more vulnerable to climate-related risks  than larger banks with a wider geographical footprint and diversified loan book. This is supported  by our analysis of the exposure of U.S. based banks to environmental risks in lending and  underwriting activities, as well as limited risk mitigation (please refer to our response to Question  1 in Annex 2).     2. Using a well-established set of reference scenarios for stress testing. Technology exists  today to quantitatively assess the resilience of investment portfolios to a net-zero climate  transition and physical climate risks under a range of scenarios. The data and methodologies can    1 MSCI ESG Ratings, research and data are produced by MSCI ESG Research LLC, a subsidiary of MSCI Inc.  2 Please refer to the MSCI ESG Ratings Methodology 
      2      also be applied to a financial institution’s business lines. To enhance the comparability of stress  test results, a single set of reference scenarios e.g. from the Network for Greening the Financial  System (NGFS), that support the shift from a qualitative to a quantitative approach over a clearly  defined time horizon would be meaningful.     3. Align with international standard setters to minimize burden and optimize results. The  framework published by the TCFD has  advanced the convergence of climate-related reporting to  be more robust and consistent, emerging national and international standards build on this, but  we also observe divergences, limiting data comparability for investors.3,4 The Financial Stability  Board (FSB) just published an interim report on supervisory and regulatory approaches to  addressing climate-related risks that also calls for a more consistent global approach to reduce  the risk of harmful market fragmentation.5    We provide the following attachments:  •  Annex 1  Detailed findings of our research on U.S. based banks’ current approach to climate risk  management.  •  Annex 2  Specific responses to the Request for Comment.  •  Annex 3  Additional research paper references relating to the impact of a net-zero transition and  physical climate risks on different asset classes and the use of climate scenarios for  portfolio optimization, risk management and regulatory reporting purposes.    We would welcome a discussion with your Office to provide additional granular information on  how financial institutions can determine climate-related financial risks that are material and  various tools and strategies that are currently available to incorporate climate risks into their risk  management framework.

The practices are ordered from the weakest (no evidence) to what we consider the best  practice.         
      7      Annex 2    MSCI responses to the questions posed in the Request for Comment    Applicability    Question 1: What additional factors, for example asset size, location, and business model,  should inform financial institutions’ adoption of these principles?     We understand the focus of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Request for  Comment is on the largest financial institutions, but note that the high size threshold of USD100  billion in total consolidated assets may potentially exclude the vast majority of financial  institutions in the U.S. According to the most recent statistics from the Federal Reserve, there are  only around 30-35 U.S. banks which hold total assets over $100bn.9 Similarly, according to the  FDIC top 100 banks and thrifts nationally, there are 35 financial institutions that hold total assets  exceeding $100bn.10     In our ESG Ratings, MSCI uses a rules-based methodology to identify industry leaders (AAA to  AA) and laggards (B and CCC rated) according to their exposure to ESG risks and how well they  manage those risks relative to peers. MSCI ESG Ratings serve as a tool to evaluate banks’ long- term resilience to financially relevant ESG risks, including environmental risks.     As regards environmental risks for the banking sector, we measure how exposed banks are to  environmental risks in lending and underwriting activities and assess their risk mitigation  practices. As can be seen in the graph below, 38% of U.S. banks within the MSCI ACWI Index  achieved a slightly above average ESG Rating of A as of May 30, 2022, while if the sample expands  to all the banks in the ACWI IMI Index – including small cap representation – this shifts to 41% of  U.S. banks having a slightly below average ESG Rating of BB.11        9 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Large Commercial Banks  (Fed | 30 September 2021)  10 Top 100 Banks and Thrifts Nationally by Asset Size (FDIC)  11 Based on companies in the Banks and Investment Banking & Brokerage industries that have Financing Environmental Impact as a  weighted Key Issue. 
      8          Taking the above findings into account, where the aim is to have a more comprehensive  understanding of macroprudential climate-related risks, there may be benefits of lowering the  $100bn threshold to bring in scope a greater part of the U.S. banking system through a phase-in  approach. Alternatively, a proportionate application may be considered to align supervisory  expectations with the risk profile and business model of the financial institutions. Financial  institutions that are outside the threshold of holding assets over $100bn may be invited to  consider these principles as a best practice.    Tailoring    Question 2: How could future guidance assist a financial institution in developing its climate- related financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile,  and scope of operations?     No comment.    General    Question 3: What challenges do financial institutions face in incorporating these draft principles  into their risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with financial  institutions to understand those challenges?     Jurisdictions that have already implemented climate stress tests for financial institutions may  offer useful examples. In 2019, the Bank of England established an industry forum, the Climate  Financial Risk Forum (CFRF), to support further regulatory engagement around climate-related  financial risk management, which was jointly convened by the Prudential Regulatory Authority  and the Financial Conduct Authority to build capacity and share best practice.12      Question 4: Would regulations or guidelines prescribing particular risk management practices  be helpful to financial institutions as they adjust to doing business in a changing climate?     No comment.        12 Climate Financial Risk Forum | Bank of England  
      9      Current Risk Management Practices    Question 5: What specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to successfully  incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk management frameworks?     From our work with clients, we have seen interest by some large U.S. banks to integrate climate  risk assessments into their enterprise level risk management system within established climate  data modelling teams. These teams are focused on building a better understanding of  quantitative climate data factors ranging from transition to physical risks. However, the number  of U.S. banks carrying out climate risk assessments at this granular level is still relatively small in  our experience.     We also work with large U.S. banks that integrate climate-related data into their credit risk  management process. Banks are able to integrate climate and ESG data into their centralized  credit risk system to supplement the due diligence process of their underwriting activities.     Adding to this, banks that operate asset and wealth management lines of business are integrating  climate data into risk, investment, and portfolio reporting transparency processes to meet  emerging regulatory standards, asset owner requirements, and to ensure that they are able to  understand the short and long-term climate risks that may impact the performance of their  portfolios.     Beyond these areas, we also observe interest in climate and ESG products coming from capital  markets and investment banking teams, sales and trading teams, sell side research teams and  asset servicing.    Question 6: How do financial institutions determine when climate-related financial risks are  material and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?     The FSB interim report on Supervisory and Regulatory Approaches to Climate-related Risk,  published in April 202213, calls for alignment in particular with regards to the following areas:  sufficiently granular data on sectors or economic activities that are sensitive, vulnerable or  exposed to physical, transition and liability risks; financial institutions’ exposures to such sectors  or economic activities; geographical location of financial institutions’ exposures most prone to  physical risk; and financial institutions’ and their counterparties’ reporting of carbon-related  metrics, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.    Climate-related financial risk exposures should be clearly defined, aligned with the financial  institution’s risk appetite, and supported by appropriate quantitative metrics. Materiality  assessments should be conducted by the financial institution regularly to reflect the speed at  which the understanding of climate risks grows and also the increasing frequency and scale of  the risks themselves.       13 Supervisory and Regulatory Approaches to Climate-related Risks (Pg. 14 - Quantitative Metrics) (FSB | 29 April 2022) 
      10      MSCI is able to support financial institutions to assess their material climate risks by providing  access to over 900 climate change metrics including emission data, fossil fuel exposure, clean  tech solutions and forward-looking indicators (see table below) to facilitate integration into  traditional financial risk and portfolio management.    Forward-looking climate risk indicators that can be used for scenario analysis  Climate Value-at-Risk   Helps  financial  institutions  estimate  scenario-specific  valuation impact/ risk for transition and physical impacts and  captures policy risk across value chain, cleantech opportunities  and physical climate risks.    Output: % of asset or loan value, security or issuer specific.  Use Case: risk management, scenario analysis.

Output: 0-10 score & 5 categories, issuer specific.  Use Case: portfolio construction, asset allocation.      Question 7: What time horizon do financial institutions consider relevant when identifying and  assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?     No comment.     Question 8: What, if any, specific products, practices, and strategies—for example, insurance or  derivatives contracts or other capital market instruments—do financial institutions use to  hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial risks?     No comment.     Question 9: What, if any, climate-related financial products or services— for example, ‘‘green  bonds,’’ derivatives, dedicated investment funds, or other instruments that take climate-related  considerations into account—do financial institutions offer to clients and customers? What  risks, if any, do these products or services pose?     No comment.     Question 10: How do financial institutions currently consider the impacts of climate-related  financial risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities, 
      11      specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities? Should the agencies modify existing  regulations and guidance, such as those associated with the Community Reinvestment Act, to  address the impact climate-related financial risks may have on LMI and other disadvantaged  communities?     No comment.    Data, Disclosures, and Reporting    Question 11: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools and models from  borrowers and other counterparties do financial institutions need to identify, measure, monitor,  and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do financial institutions currently  obtain this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data,  metrics, tools or models?     A number of banks globally obtain a range of ESG and climate-related information and tools from  MSCI. These include:     (i) Investment portfolio   MSCI offers the following tools to banks to identify, measure, monitor, report and control their  own climate-related financial risks.     a. External Reporting - Report to investors, shareholders and other stakeholders on the climate- alignment of portfolios, progress against net-zero commitments and alignment with key  temperature thresholds.   b. Climate Risk Management / Scenario Analysis - Identify and understand climate risk exposures  and trends within and across funds and portfolios. Deepen insight into climate-related risks and  opportunities, stress test portfolios and model scenarios to inform investment decision-making.   c. Internal Reporting – Streamline internal reporting of risks associated with the transition to a  net-zero economy and the physical manifestations of a warming world. Visualize climate risk  exposures and trends at the enterprise level and across funds and portfolios.   d. TCFD Aligned Reporting - Understand bank’s complete carbon footprint and report on climate- related governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets in line with the TCFD.  Available as a managed service that features portfolio-data management, batch reporting and  customization capabilities.     (ii) Loans and lending activities   Assessing climate risks in banks’ lending activities can be challenging, due to limited disclosure  by credit counterparties. MSCI’s environmental risk exposure analysis includes:     •  A focus on commercial lending, as the environmental impact from this type of lending is  easier to trace and quantify compared to retail lending.   •  An analysis of the commercial loan book to determine the lender’s concentration in different  industries.  
      12      •  Assignment of an Environmental Intensity Score to each loan segment and calculating a  Weighted Average Financing Intensity of the loan book.   •  Comparing the scores among all banks to arrive at a final picture of the environmental  intensity of each lender’s loan portfolio relative to peers.    (iii) Capital markets and investment banking   In our continued engagement with U.S. based banks, we observe that they are incorporating the  use of climate-related data and tools in their capital markets and investment banking divisions.  For example, MSCI is beginning to provide ESG and climate assessments of pre-IPO private  companies to support investment banking teams advising those companies. Banks’ sales and  trading teams are also using ESG ratings and climate metrics to support issuance of OTC and  structured products that integrate ESG and climate considerations into their portfolio  constructions.    Question 12: How could existing regulatory reporting requirements be augmented to better  capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related financial risks?     MSCI supports a framework that supplements quantitative disclosures with a qualitative overlay  of a financial institution’s views on its climate risks and opportunities. However, “boilerplate  statements” should be discouraged in favor of meaningful disclosure that explains how these  risks and opportunities are being managed and how they might be expected to impact the  financial institution in the foreseeable future. MSCI supports alignment of public disclosures that  align with the TCFD recommendations, particularly as they pertain to quantitative and forward- looking metrics and targets. We note this was also a recommendation (Recommendation 3.2) put  forward by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in its Report on Climate-Related  Financial Risk.14    In practice, countries diverge in their implementation of TCFD-style disclosure, as we assessed in  a recent research blog (see chart below).15      14 FSOC’s Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk (FSOC | 2021)  15 As TCFD Comes of Age, Regulators Take a Varied Approach  (MSCI | April 2022) 
      13          Scenario Analysis Question    13: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management that requires  assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do financial institutions use climate  scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face?     MSCI agrees that climate scenario models, analysis or tools are of paramount importance to  gauge the effects of climate change spread across various time horizons. Scenario analysis  provides a powerful tool for financial institutions to understand the implications of climate  change for their portfolios. However, one of the major challenges is the use of varied scenarios  and tools by financial institutions, which means that results may not be comparable. Secondly,  financial institutions are expected to determine which climate-related and environmental risks are  material in the short, medium and long term with regard to their business strategy by using  scenario analysis. The assumptions can span from quantitative and/or qualitative factors and  not solely based on historical experiences.     We note that there are a range of models currently available in the market to assist financial  institutions with forward-looking scenario analysis for certain lines of business. Financial  institutions use tools made available by MSCI, such as Climate Value-at-Risk to gain a forward- looking lens when conducting scenario analysis. For example, by calculating the financial risks  from climate change per security and per scenario, Climate Value-at-Risk provides a framework  that can help banks identify and understand these risks and take necessary action for effective  risk management and regulatory reporting purposes. The MSCI Climate Value-at-Risk model has  three main underlying components which can be used separately or in aggregate: 
      14        1. Policy risk: This component aggregates future policy costs based on an end of the century  time horizon. By overlaying climate policy outlooks and future emission reduction price  estimates onto company data, the model provides insights into how current and forthcoming  climate policies could affect companies.   2. Technology opportunities: This component is based on company-specific data on the patents  each company holds related to low-carbon technologies, providing insights into how  companies’ strategic investments could affect their future competitive positioning in a low  carbon economy.   3. Physical risks: This component estimates the impact and financial risk relating to several  extreme weather hazards, such as extreme heat and cold and flood risk. An extensive asset  location database comprising of over 400,000 company facilities has been overlaid with  hazards maps. Based on sector-based vulnerabilities, each location’s climate-related revenue  loss for eight extreme weather hazards is computed with the help of damage and business  interruption functions.    Question 14: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing and  executing scenario analysis exercises?    MSCI notes that using different models and scenarios leads to results that are not comparable.  While this gives financial institutions some flexibility to choose a model for self-examination, it is  important for the market to be able to effectively compare the results of a prescribed scenario  analysis on various financial institutions. This could be solved by having a minimum set of  specific climate scenarios to consider. It would further be helpful if the FDIC guidance around  scenario analysis were to provide examples of acceptable Representative Concentration  Pathways (RCPs), Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and/or Shared Socioeconomic  Pathways (SSPs) and prescribe precise time horizons.     Regulators around the world are adopting scenarios developed by the NGFS and requiring banks  and financial institutions to align their climate stress tests accordingly (e.g., Bank of England16,  European Central Bank17, Hong Kong Monetary Authority18). We observe that financial authorities,  including regulators and supervisory bodies, are increasingly involved in assessing climate- related financial risks and conducting stress tests for banks and insurance companies to quantify  their exposure to these risks. Such exercises were completed in the Netherlands and France, and  are underway in the EU, UK, Australia, Singapore and Canada.19 More countries are expected to  integrate climate-related risks into macroprudential regimes for the financial sector, in the  future.20 We support improved climate data collection from financial institutions to make stress  tests comparable and evaluate whether climate change risks threaten financial stability.        16 Key elements of the 2021 Biennial Exploratory Scenario: Financial risks from climate change  (Bank of England | 2021)  17 ECB Banking Supervision launches 2022 climate risk stress test (europa.eu) (ECB | January 2022)  18 Pilot Banking Sector Climate Risk Stress Test (hkma.gov.hk) (HKMA | December 2021)  19 FSI Insights on policy implementation No 34 Stress-testing banks for climate change – a comparison of practices (FSI | July 2021)  20 NGFS publishes the report “Scenarios in Action: a progress report on global supervisory and central bank climate scenario exercises”  | Banque de France (NGFS | October 2021)

2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-060,"\>'llOUDToa.1,  June 3, 2022  Mr. James Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429  WYOMING BANKERS ASSOCIATION  200 East 81h Ave.  P.O. Box 2190  Cheyenne, Wxoming 82003  (307)638-5008 / FAX(307)638-5013  RE: ST A TEMENT OF PRINCIPLES FOR CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL RISK  MANAGEMENT FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS [RIN 3064-ZA32]  Dear Mr. Sheesley:  The Wyoming Bankers Association, representing dozens of community banks across Wyoming  and the communities they serve, urge the FDIC to take all reasonable and appropriate measures to  ensure any principles for climate-related financial risk management for large banks, if finalized,  do not facilitate the choking off of lawful but climate-disfavored industries from the banking  system. Banks should have the ability to lend to any consumer or corporate citizen who is  creditworthy and engaged in lawful activity, without fear of political or regulatory retribution.  This includes the energy sector and the extractive industry sector. Accordingly, we fervently  oppose the FDIC or any financial regulator using the banking system to advance a climate agenda  by pressuring banks to choke-off select customer or industry access to credit.  Although the FDIC's statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management only  applies to large financial institutions, namely those with $100 billion or more total consolidated  assets, we are concerned such risk management will negatively impact Wyoming community  banks and their local communities. Consider the fact that Wyoming's economy is strongly tied  to the energy and extractive industries.  These industries often rely on strong banking  relationships, many of which have banking needs that far exceed what a local community bank  can provide. If large financial institutions are pressured or required to ""de-risk"" their loan  portfolios and choke-off lawful but climate disfavored customers or industries from the financial  system, this will put enormous pressure on Wyoming community banks to try to provide such  services, many of which either will not or cannot because they are insufficiently skilled in this type  of banking. That, in tum, puts local communities at enormous risk of not having sufficient  banking resources.  Financial risks, physical risks and transition risks already exist within the banking system - and  financial institutions adequately manage these risks using longstanding and time-tested risk  management practices. Remember, the banking system, both from a national standpoint as well 
To:  RE:  Date:  Page 2  Mr. James Sheesley  Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management For Large Financial Institutions  June 3, 2022  as from state standpoint, is already one of the most highly regulated industries in the country.  Neither the FDIC nor any financial regulator should cause or worsen transition risks by pressuring  banks to de-risk lawful but climate-disfavored customers or industries under a newly formed  climate-related financial risk management framework.  The Wyoming Banking Association is also concerned these principles may eventually trickle down  and be applied to community banks, either directly through future rulemaking or indirectly as ""best  practices.""  The steep expense, complex models, governance requirements and specialized  expertise that would be necessary for Wyoming community banks and their customers to bear, if  these principles applied to banks with fewer than $100 billion total consolidated assets, would be  cost and resource prohibitive for the dozens of Wyoming community banks that proudly serve our  communities and local businesses and have survived decades of natural disasters and climate  events.  Furthermore, we are concerned the FDIC's principles on data, risk measurement and reporting  could eventually require Wyoming community banks to gather climate data directly from their  customers, vendors and other third parties. Consumers and small businesses (many of which do  not have, and are unable to collect, sophisticated climate data) should never be compelled to  produce climate data as a condition for obtaining basic banking services.  The mere existence of risk (whether financial, physical or transition risk) does not, in and of itself,  constitute a threat to the safety and soundness of individual banks or our financial system.  Instead, the relevant question is whether banks and their regulators are properly managing such  risks. As evidenced by the fact the FDIC's principles do not identify even a single instance of  bank failure in the aftermath of a severe weather event, banks throughout the entire history of the  U.S. banking system have universally demonstrated an ability to manage climate risks.  As the FDIC develops its approach to climate-related financial risk management, we encourage  the FDIC to conduct studies, review the FDIC's nearly one hundred years of banking data and  gather empirical information to better understand the efficacy of the current risk management  framework in managing climate-related financial risk, the need to address any specific gaps in the  current framework, and the degree to which climate-related financial risk may or may not actually  threaten the safet and soundness of the financial system.  Wyoming Bankers Association","The Wyoming Bankers Association (WBA) expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. They argue that these principles could lead to the exclusion of lawful but climate-disfavored industries, such as energy and extractive sectors, from the banking system. The WBA fears this could pressure Wyoming community banks, which may lack the capacity to support these industries, thereby risking local economic stability. They emphasize that existing risk management practices are sufficient and warn against imposing complex and costly requirements on smaller banks. The WBA also opposes any potential trickle-down effect of these principles to community banks, which could burden them with unnecessary data collection and compliance costs. They urge the FDIC to study historical data to assess the actual threat of climate-related risks to the financial system's safety and soundness."
2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-061,"June 3, 2022      James P. Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC  20429    Re: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) Request for Comment on  ""Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions” (RIN 3064–ZA32)    Dear Mr. Sheesley:  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce (“the Chamber”) appreciates the opportunity to  share our views in response to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC” or  “agency”) request for feedback on “Statement of Principles for Climate-Related  Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions” (“principles” or  “proposal”).     The Chamber has been a leader in the conversation on environmental, social,  and governance (“ESG”) topics for nearly a decade, and we continue to actively  collaborate with our members and other stakeholders to promote practices, policies,  and technology innovations across industry and government that address our shared  climate challenges, particularly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the lowest  levels possible at the pace of innovation.      Having been engaged on ESG topics across all industries, the Chamber is also a  ready participant in conversations about the impacts of climate change on our  financial system. While the Chamber is supportive of the overall goals of the FDIC as  we move toward a low carbon economy, we also support the development of market- driven solutions to these problems. As we noted in a 2020 report, “the fundamental  challenge we face today is to preserve the ability of American companies to grow,  innovate, and drive prosperity under a system of free and fair capitalism. The  Chamber—through its Project Growth and Opportunity or “Project GO”—is committed 
to identifying practical, sustainable ways to address socio-economic challenges.”1 As a  part of this effort, the Chamber, in 2019, released principles for ESG reporting that are  both material and industry specific.2    These FDIC principles follow the actions of other regulators who are also  prioritizing the development and implementation of a standardized reporting regime  for climate risks. Earlier in 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)  released a request for feedback that is substantively similar to the FDIC request.  Around the same time, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) accepted  comments on a proposal it issued on climate-related financial risk for banks. As noted  in this request, the FDIC plans to issue forthcoming guidance on climate risk “that  would distinguish roles and responsibilities of boards of directors (boards) and  management, incorporate the feedback received on the principles, and consider  lessons learned and best practices from the industry and other jurisdictions.” We  applaud the FDIC for its stated intention to incorporate feedback from stakeholders  and urge you in any future guidance to collaborate with other regulators at home and  abroad who are taking these similar steps on climate risk.     It is also critical to point out that in any forthcoming guidance on climate- related financial risk, the FDIC should not recommend moving capital away from  industries or sectors that may have more environmental risk. As the federal agency  standing behind consumers’ deposits and tasked with resolving failed institutions, the  FDIC has a keen interest in the safety and soundness of insured depository  institutions. Directing capital away from politically disfavored industries can be  dangerous for our entire economy. Indeed, such an approach would lead to wide  swings in regulation as political Administrations change, undermining confidence in  our banking system. We encourage the FDIC to limit its focus on supporting financial  institutions in their assessments of climate risks only for safety and soundness  purposes.   Responses to FDIC Principles and Questions  In the comments below, the Chamber addresses certain aspects of climate- related financial risk management for banks and answers specific questions posed in  the guidance.    1 Restarting the Growth Engine: A Plan to Reform America’s Capital Markets, U.S. Chamber of  Commerce Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness (November 2020). ccmc_growthengine_final.pdf  (uschamber.com)  2 ESG Reporting Best Practices, U.S. Chamber of Commerce Project GO (2019).  https://www.projectgo.com/esg-reporting-best-practices/ 
Governance  The need to understand the exposure and impact of climate-related financial  risk is important, but the outline of governance in the principles is short on specific  requirements and instead gives a high-level review of expectations for bank  management. While the request mentions that a bank’s board and management  should demonstrate “appropriate understanding of climate-related financial risk  exposures,” it seems to be left to the FDIC’s discretion to determine what is  appropriate. The proposal also mentions that the board’s understanding and  knowledge to assess the potential impact of climate-related risks on an institution  should be “adequate” but gives no detail as to what constitutes adequate knowledge.  As we have mentioned, the Chamber supports market-driven solutions, and many  public companies—including banks—are already demonstrating a significant  understanding of these risks.3 Institutions are also integrating climate-related policies  and responsibilities throughout their organizations. Further guidance from the FDIC  should take into account these efforts and the deep understanding of climate risks  that banks already possess.    Strategic Planning  The Chamber commends the FDIC for recognizing that strategic planning for  climate-related financial risk is an iterative process, and the proposal notes that  climate risks evolve and mature over time. The proposal also notes that “any climate- related strategies, including any relevant corporate social responsibility objectives,  should align with and support the bank’s broader strategy, risk appetite, and risk  management framework.” Climate-related risk is one of a host of risks, and banks  must institute different strategies to prepare for each type of risk in any strategic  planning.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has even noted that there is a  limited amount of research and accompanying data that explore how climate risk  drivers feed into transmission channels and the financial risks faced by banks.”4  Undue emphasis on climate-related risk in strategic planning could lead banks to  spend inordinate time and resources on climate risks when others are more material.  We urge that in any forthcoming guidance, the FDIC not place an undue emphasis on  climate-related risks over others in a bank’s overall risk strategy.      3 See for example the Chamber’s report on materiality of corporate disclosures.

Management of Risk Areas   Managing climate risks presents an added layer of difficulty for banks  since these risks must be incorporated into a bank’s overall risk profile.  Research by Federal Reserve staff recognizes these challenges:  In principle, quantifying climate-related risks should be  similar to quantifying other financial stability risks. In  practice,  however, climate-related  risks  face  several  challenges to measurement beyond those associated with  conventional financial system vulnerabilities and potential  shocks, and which will require investment to address. These  climate-related features impair not only estimation and  modeling at the level of the overall economy, but also the  analysis of region-, sector-, asset-, institution-, and investor- level exposures. Investment in data procurement, and careful  analysis of climate-related data to describe specific  economic and financial risks, is critical to addressing these  challenges and producing high-quality research on climate- related outcomes.5  The proposal also makes numerous references to physical risks of climate  change like damage to property and business disruptions and notes that financial  institutions are likely to be affected by these risks. However, the proposal fails to note  that those risks are often negligible and very short-lived. A staff report by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York concluded that:   FEMA disasters over the last quarter century had insignificant  or small effects on U.S. banks’ performance. This stability  seems endogenous rather than a mere reflection of federal aid.  Disasters increase loan demand, which offsets losses and  actually boosts profits at larger banks. Local banks tend to  avoid mortgage lending where floods are more common than  official flood maps would predict, suggesting that local  knowledge may also mitigate disaster impacts.6     5 Board of Governors of the Federal System, Climate Change and Financial Stability,   https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/climate-change-and-financial-stability- 20210319.htm   6 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks? (November 2021),   https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr990.pdf  
  In any future guidance, the FDIC should consider the challenge banks  face in managing climate risk while recognizing that many banks are already  doing significant work to mitigate the effects of climate-related disasters.  The proposal notes specific risk areas that bank should account for in  their risk management plans:  A. Credit Risk  Credit risk is an important aspect of a bank’s overall risk profile. In the context of  climate-related events, staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York noted that  climate disasters have not proven to be a significant source of risk for banks:  Our findings suggest the disaster channel is not likely a  material source of instability for banks. Even very small banks  facing extreme disasters are not substantially threatened. This  resilience seems inherent to some degree because disasters  increase the demand for loans. Earnings on new loans helps  offset losses on loans on the books. In fact, income for larger  banks increases after disasters. Local banks also manage to  limit exposure to high-risk areas, perhaps reflecting their  greater knowledge of such risks. Those endogenous factors  seem to buttress banks more than federal disaster assistance.7  The FDIC should consider these findings in any future guidance related to credit  risk, in addition to recognizing that relying on credit risk models presents its own set  of challenges: “the estimation of credit risk models needed to generate loss  projections relies on a limited set of datapoints and has no near-term potential for  back-testing. Furthermore, because the loss projections rely so heavily on the  judgment of experts, validating the projections is nearly impossible.”8  B.  Liquidity Risk  The guidance directs banks to “assess whether climate-related financial risks  could affect liquidity buffers and, if so, incorporate those risks into their liquidity risk  management and liquidity buffers.” Banks already incorporate these risks into their  risk management profile. With already stringent liquidity requirements in place for  banks, the Chamber cautions the FDIC against issuing any guidance that would  unnecessarily burden banks with increased liquidity requirements, thus impairing    7 Federal Reserve Bank of New York at  https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr990.pdf   8 Bank Policy Institute (BPI), Challenges in Stress Testing and Climate Change (October 2020),   https://bpi.com/challenges-in-stress-testing-and-climate-change/   
banks’ ability to meet customer needs. As noted above, banks consider all forms of  risk, and climate-related risk is only one of a host of risks they must weigh.    C.  Legal/Compliance Risk  As with any new regulations, legal and compliance risks will increase for banks  as they are required to incorporate climate risk into their overall risk profile. This will  be particularly acute for banks that have instituted a massive increase in legal and  compliance staff in the wake of the regulatory barrage following the implementation of  the Dodd-Frank Act. In any forthcoming guidance, the FDIC should weigh the  implications of future regulatory actions on banks’ compliance efforts, as such  compliance costs are regressive to the size of an institution. This is important to note  as mid-size banks are important providers of financing for main street businesses.    The guidelines also note that any consideration of risks by banks should  include “possible fair lending concerns if the bank’s risk mitigation measures  disproportionately affect communities or households on a prohibited basis such as  race or ethnicity.” The Chamber notes that banks are acutely aware of the potential  impacts of their risk mitigation efforts and are committed to instituting risk measures  that do not disproportionately affect any particular communities, including their  obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and applicable fair lending  laws.     Below, we address specific questions posed in the FDIC principles:  Question 1: Are there additional categories of banks (i.e., based on asset size, location,  business model) to which these principles should apply?   The Chamber does not feel that these principles should apply to other  categories of banks. The choice of a $100 billion threshold already encapsulates a  significant number of banks and will encompass more as banks grow organically and  as the industry continues to consolidate. In any event, the Chamber urges  coordination with other bank regulators to ensure that these principles are applied  fairly.    Question 2: How could future guidance assist a bank in developing its climate-related  financial risk management practices commensurate to its size, complexity, risk profile,  and scope of operations?   The Chamber applauds the FDIC for its intention to maintain a risk-based  approach to supervision and to tailor future guidance based on banks’ complexity of 
operations and business models. In future guidance, the FDIC should recognize that  banks have differing risk profiles and needs based on their size and structure. We  believe that appropriate tailoring should be included in any future guidance for banks  related to climate risk based on size, complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations.  Question 3: What challenges do banks face in incorporating these principles into their  risk management systems? How should the FDIC further engage with banks to  understand those challenges?  Compliance issues are always among the biggest challenges in implementing  new policies and procedures at any financial institution. Even when banks undertake  these changes voluntarily, which many are doing, the transition costs and burdens are  significant. As the FDIC plans to issue future guidance on climate risk, banks would  likely welcome engagement with the agency. This request for feedback, along with  other public interaction with banks, will provide the FDIC opportunities to better  understand the challenges banks face in incorporating climate risk into their risk  management systems.    Question 5: How do banks determine when climate-related financial risks are material  and warrant greater than routine attention by the board and management?               Banks and other financial institutions are making investments in more climate- smart, modern, resilient infrastructure to reduce overall risks over the asset life cycle.  Companies that have operations or products dependent on natural resources or are  geographically at risk to climate impacts are often highlighting material implications in  disclosures.   From a climate risk perspective, banks take into consideration the plausibility  and certainty of a risk to determine materiality. Risks that meet these criteria will  warrant greater attention by boards and management. If a bank determines that risks  are speculative and distant, they generally will not consider them material or give them  heightened scrutiny. Banks should be given the flexibility to determine what is  material, and in future guidance, the FDIC should recognize that these determinations  are evolving due to the immaturity of data.    Question 9: How do banks currently consider the impacts of climate-related financial  risk mitigation strategies and financial products on households and communities,  specifically LMI and other disadvantaged communities?  Banks are acutely aware that their risk mitigation strategies could impact  communities and are focusing on building resilience as part of investments. A major 
strategic focus of banks is compliance with CRA. Under CRA, banks are required to  consider the impact of their business decisions on low-to-moderate income (LMI) and  other disadvantaged communities. Allowing banks to receive CRA credit for climate  risk mitigation activity in LMI communities would be an attractive way to promote  responsible climate policies and transition to cleaner investments while also  furthering the investment goals of the CRA.  Question 10: What, if any, specific climate-related data, metrics, tools, and models  from borrowers and other counterparties do banks need to identify, measure, monitor,  and control their own climate-related financial risks? How do banks currently obtain  this information? What gaps and other concerns are there with respect to these data,  metrics, tools, or models?  Regarding data, the Chamber commends the FDIC for its acknowledgment that  “data, risk measurement, modeling methodologies, and reporting continue to evolve at  a rapid pace.” A major point of concern for Chamber members is the fact that, while  data is foundational, it is currently very immature. Since collection of climate data is in  its early stages, banks are still trying to determine what data needs to be collected  and do not have a complete understanding of what is useful. Data will improve over  time, but the Chamber requests that the FDIC explicitly appreciate that current data  collection practices are not at their end state. Banks have a strong desire to comply  with supervisory expectations and requirements, but there is a need for phasing or an  iterative process in the early stages as each bank determines what is useful. Long lead  times should be permitted, and the Chamber asks that regulators provide banks  latitude in any forthcoming guidance regarding data collection.   Another major concern banks have regarding data, disclosures, and reporting is  the audience for the data. Banks would want to know if the information they provide  will be private and only for regulators’ use, or if it will be made public.   The FDIC should also make use of any data that is collected and reported to  international bodies. Coordination by these agencies is key to reducing burdens on  banks to provide redundant information. This will streamline requirements for banks  and help avoid duplicative, time-consuming efforts to comply with the demands of  multiple regulators.    Question 12: Scenario analysis is an important component of climate risk management  that requires assumptions about plausible future states of the world. How do banks  use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools and what challenges do they face?  Banks engage in “scenario analysis,” but banks define the term in a variety of  ways, and this request does not attempt to bring clarity by defining the term. In any 
forthcoming guidance, the Chamber requests that the FDIC clarify what is meant by  “scenario analysis,” as it is an ambiguous term that could encompass many different  types of planning. Additionally, the Chamber asks the FDIC to clarify who will be  responsible for conducting scenario analysis: will the FDIC be conducting the analysis,  or will the responsibility fall to banks or third parties?   The Chamber does not believe that scenario analysis should be tied to capital  or liquidity requirements. Scenario analysis should only be used to help understand  potential risks to a bank’s balance sheet and inform its overall risk management  strategy.  It is important to note that the SEC is also exploring scenario analysis  requirements. The SEC Chair has made reference to requiring “scenario analysis” on  how a business might adapt to the range of possible physical, legal, market, and  economic changes that the company could contend with in the future related to  climate. As with all other aspects of this guidance, in any attempts by the FDIC to  implement scenario analysis, the FDIC should coordinate with regulators who are  pursuing similar goals to avoid duplicative regulatory requirements for banks.    Question 13: What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when designing  and executing scenario analysis exercises?  It is important to recognize the distinction between traditional stress testing  exercises and climate scenario analysis:  Stress testing for climate change is starkly different from  existing macro stress testing and given data and methodology  challenges likely to be less reliable.  First, the lack of historical  data creates important challenges in modeling the interactions  between climate, the macroeconomy, and the financial sector,  which are necessary requirements in designing plausible and  coherent scenarios. Second, climate stress testing attempts to  measure outcomes over a much longer time horizon—30 to 50  years rather than nine quarters for macroeconomic stress  testing. Third, models that generally relate credit losses to  climate risk scenarios require large amounts of information  about future counterparty behavior over a long time horizon.  Fourth, climate stress tests generally assume that banks take  no actions to hedge or reduce exposures to climate risks over  that horizon.  While macroeconomic stress testing has a similar  assumption regarding hedging, and therefore may produce 
some error over a nine-quarter horizon, this assumption,  however, becomes deeply counterfactual over a period of  decades.”9  The proposal also recognizes this difference, and we encourage the FDIC to  continue to account for this difference in any forthcoming proposals. Additionally, for  any future design or execution of scenario analysis, the FDIC should follow the  appropriate notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act  (“APA”). New policies related to climate-related financial risk should be made only  after weighing the costs and benefits of the chosen course, with justification for new  policies being made clear to affected parties and the public. Public notice and  comment are a vital component of rulemaking and should guide all regulatory efforts.  Clear communication with banks is important, and banks should have fair and  advanced notice of their disclosure and compliance obligations. We encourage the  FDIC to provide fair notice, expressly communicate its expectations, and adhere to the  APA.  Conclusion  As the FDIC reviews the current landscape of climate-related risk for banks,  and considers possible new guidance, it must recognize the remarkable progress that  has already been achieved through market-based approaches and practices and  increased communication between banks and their customers. The business  community has made building climate-smart, modern, resilient infrastructure among  our top priorities.  Any proposals related to climate risk for banks should afford banks  the flexibility to adequately adopt disclosures that are appropriate, considering a  bank’s particular business, operations, and financial performance.

2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-062,"June 3, 2022    Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments—RIN 3064–ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW Washington, DC 20429    Statement of Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions    Dear Mr. Sheesley,    Climate Advisers is an advocacy organization that works to strengthen climate action in the United  States and around the world. Although we focus on all aspects of climate policy and climate risk,  we specialize in forest conservation and other natural climate solutions. For the better part of a  decade, we have analyzed material climate-related financial risks to investors and companies  through such projects as Orbitas and Chain Reaction Research. We commend the FDIC on drafting  principles that would provide a high-level framework to guide financial institutions in managing  exposures to climate-related financial risks. Climate risk is global in scope and is not confined to  any one sector.     In response to the FDIC’s request for comment on climate-related financial risks, Climate Advisers  recommends an economy-wide approach that incorporates all climate-related risks, including  those connected to global supply chain emissions in the agriculture, forestry, and other land use  (AFOLU) sector. A holistic approach is particularly important in the AFOLU sector since many U.S.  financial institutions are exposed to climate risk from the production of globally traded agricultural  commodities around the world.    U.S. financial institutions lending and providing credit to a range of industries face material  climate-related financial risks from deforestation, including both physical and transition risks, but  that information is not clearly and consistently presented in a reliable, comparable way.  Therefore, it is important that the FDIC includes climate-related financial risks related to  deforestation in its principles and develops a framework that provides the safe and sound  management of these exposures. In particular, Climate Advisers recommends the following 
2      mechanisms for incorporating climate-related financial risk related to deforestation into the next  iteration of the FDIC Principles:    1. Align guidance with internationally recognized frameworks like the Task Force on Climate- Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Task Force on Nature-Related Financial  Disclosures (TNFD), the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, and CDP.  a. We urge the FDIC to propose rules for expanded climate transparency and reduce  reporting burden by aligning with recommendations from the TCFD, TNFD, GHG  Protocol, and CDP.   b. As a part of adopting best practices from the TNFD and TCFD, the FDIC should  specifically include climate-related financial risks from deforestation in its risk  management, governance, strategic planning, and goal setting principles.  c. These frameworks enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures and will do  much to protect the integrity of the capital markets, promote market efficiency, and  protect banks through requiring more comparable, consistently presented, and  reliable information about climate-related risks.      2. Given that sectors that represent about 40 percent of the U.S. economy are exposed to  commodity-driven deforestation, all FDIC financial institutions should disclose how they  are managing climate risks related to tropical deforestation in value chains.  a. Since deforestation both generates GHG emissions in the current year and reduces  carbon storage capacity in future years, institutions that finance sectors with high  deforestation risk have an outsized impact on climate change.  b. Tropical supply chains for imports of beef, palm oil, soy, timber, natural rubber,  cacao, and coffee are located in regions with elevated risk of deforestation, putting  financial institutions at particularly high risk of funding activities linked to illegal  logging and deforestation, environmental damage, climate change impacts, human  rights abuses, and biodiversity loss, as recognized by the $8.7 trillion Investors  Policy Dialogue on Deforestation.  c. Given the systemic material economic risks to financial institutions if temperature  increases of 1.5 degrees Celsius or less is not achieved, specific climate disclosure  related to deforestation risks needs to be clearly incorporated into FDIC rules.    3. As a part of assessing climate-related financial risks, financial institutions should monitor  key forest ecosystems at particularly high risk of collapse and analyze potential impacts to  financial stability.  a. We agree with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) statement:  “Climate-related financial risks pose a clear and significant risk to the U.S. financial  system and, if unmitigated, may pose a near-term threat to safe and sound banking  and financial stability. Weaknesses in how institutions identify, measure, monitor,  and control the physical and transition risks associated with a changing climate 
3      could adversely affect a financial institution’s safety and soundness, as well as the  overall financial system.”1   b. Climate Advisers has documented the material risks to U.S. financial stability that  could result from continued deforestation and the potential collapse of the Amazon  ecosystem, which is estimated to occur when 25 percent of the Amazon is  deforested.2    These recommendations would effectively meet the needs of financial institutions and insurance  companies that are exposed to climate-related risks from deforestation. In this comment (please  see the Annex starting on the next page), we broadly explain the importance of forest protection  and sustainable land management practices for meeting globally agreed climate goals, including  in the Paris climate agreement, and then discuss the financially material risks posed by  deforestation to financial institutions that lend across a range of industries.       Thank you in advance for considering our comments. We would be pleased to discuss any  questions that you may have on our feedback.    Sincerely,    Climate Advisers                                        1 “Request for Comment on the Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions,” FDIC, https://www.fdic.gov/news/board-matters/2022/2022-03-29-notational-mem.pdf.  2 Climate-Related Forest, Food, and Land Risk Threaten U.S. Financial Stability.  https://www.climateadvisers.org/insightsfeed/climate-related-forest-food-and-land-risks-threaten-us-financial-stability/ 
4      ANNEX    Section 1: Relevance of Forest Protection and Sustainable Land Management to Risk Analysis                 Rules to mitigate climate-related financial risks would be ineffective without specific requirements  directed to agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU). Globally, the Agriculture, Forestry,  and Other Land Use (AFOLU)  sector is responsible for almost a quarter (23 percent) of net  anthropogenic global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC).3 Moreover, if activities in the pre- and post-production food systems  such as processing, distribution, consumption, and food waste are included, the contribution to  net anthropogenic global GHG from AFOLU emissions could be as high as 37 percent.4      A major reason that the forest, food, and land sector contributes so substantially to anthropogenic  GHG emissions is through deforestation, which alone is responsible for 11 percent of global  emissions.5 Maintaining healthy forests and reforesting degraded forest land are critical to  achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development  Goals. Every IPCC pathway leading to average temperature increases of 1.5 degrees Celsius or  less compared to pre-industrial temperatures is premised on no new deforestation after 2030.6  The Paris Agreement emphasizes the importance of combating deforestation, and the AFOLU  sector is the only economic sector with its own chapter in that accord. Political support for  conserving and restoring forests globally was also on display in 2021 when President Joe Biden  joined more than 140 world leaders in endorsing the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and  Land Use, which committed nations representing more than 90 percent of the world’s forests to  ending natural forest loss this decade.     Section 2: Financial material risks from deforestation    Financial markets have already signaled that they consider deforestation a financial material  climate risk. A recent initiative with $8.5 trillion in assets under management, the Investors Policy  Dialogue on Deforestation (IPDD) is indicative of financial institutions’ growing understanding of  the risks of AFOLU risks.7 IPDD was established in 2020, and is comprised of 58 financial  institutions and investors concerned about the “financial impacts that deforestation and the    3 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “Special report on climate change and land use,” Summary for Policy Makers, A.3, p.  10, 2019, https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl.   4 Id.  5 “REDD+ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation,” Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States,  https://www.fao.org/redd/en/.  6 Citing Rogelj, J., et al.

5      violation of the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities may have on their clients and  investee companies by potentially increasing reputational, operational and regulatory risks.”8 It  identifies three channels by which deforestation risks create financial risk for issuers and  investors: ESG risks; supply chain risks; and finance sector risks.9    The financial risks of deforestation are particularly acute with respect to seven commodity  products–cattle (exported as processed beef), palm oil, soy, timber, natural rubber, cacao, and  coffee.10 A CDP analysis of 187 companies potentially affected by climate and deforestation  commodity risk found that nearly 25 percent of those companies’ revenue depended on four  commodities linked to deforestation: beef, soy, timber, and palm oil.11     In addition to company-specific risks, U.S. financial institutions face material physical and  transition climate risks from forest, food, and land sectors that are currently not being adequately  addressed, which in turn threaten the entire U.S. financial system.      The material risk of  significant ecosystem service losses in tropical regions and the broad cross-section of U.S. sectors  exposed increase the likelihood of political, economic, and social instability. On the other hand,  action by the Biden administration and U.S. regulators can mitigate this risk and have outsized  climate benefits while protecting U.S. financial firms. Climate-related forest, food, and land risks  are squarely at the intersection of national security, financial stability, and human rights.     According to recent data from Forests and Finance, U.S. financial institutions provided over $2  billion in financing to forest risk companies in 2020 and more than 12 billion in 2021.12 However,  direct financing to forest risk companies, alone, significantly underestimates the systemic threats  of tropical deforestation to the U.S. financial system. To illustrate the scale of potential financial  impacts, sectors directly exposed to tropical commodity supply chain risk include food and  beverage processing and production, automobile manufacturing, textiles, chemicals,    8 Id.  9 Id.  Among ESG risks, IPDD identifies GHG emissions, biodiversity loss, flood and soil erosion, and rainfall reduction among  environmental risks; land rights violations, Indigenous peoples’ rights violations; and health hazards from increased exposure to  haze as among social risks of concern; and illegality of the deforestation, bribery to reduce enforcement of limits on permissible  forestry or agriculture, and financial crimes, including tax evasion and money laundering, as among governance concerns.  Supply  chain risks include productivity declines; property damage; increased security staff costs, inability to adapt to changes in regulation,  litigation for failure to manage ESG risks, and cancellation of contracts and reduced demand from consumers concerned about  deforestation. Finance sector risks include losses to investors from stranded assets or negative returns on investments; banks’ losses  from nonperforming loans, increased default risk and loss of revenues; regulatory risks from the inability of companies to meet new  regulatory requirements, such as due diligence/ESG requirements and risk weightings; failure to disclose ESG risks in portfolios;  possible litigation against investors for breach of fiduciary duty due to failure to integrate ESG; increased accountability for ESG  impacts under the new OECD guidelines; and reputational risks from damage to brand value and loss of credibility as a responsible  investor or bank.

6      pharmaceuticals, retail, food service, personal care products, print publishing, forestry,  construction, energy and biofuels, and finance.13 Using data from the Bureau of Economic  Analysis, Climate Advisers calculates that these sectors generate about 45 percent of US private- sector GDP and 40 percent of total U.S. GDP—but more broadly the nation’s entire financial  system is also exposed in more systemic ways due to the interconnected nature of global climate  impacts.14      15     The supply chain risks are particularly concentrated in commodities coming from Indonesia and  Brazil, which together generate roughly 60 percent of the GHG emissions generated from tropical  deforestation, but a broad cross-section of industrial and retail sectors in the United States is  directly exposed to tropical commodity risk in these countries.16      As noted earlier, at COP26 in  Glasgow, 142 countries, including major forested nations Brazil, Canada, China, Indonesia,  Russia, and the United States, committed to stopping deforestation.17 As deforestation,  particularly tropical deforestation, is driven predominantly by the expansion of industrial  agriculture, this agreement presents regulatory risk, and will have implications for costs and  availability of agricultural commodities across supply chains. There may be stranded assets if  enforcement is robust: In Indonesia, as much as 76 percent of unplanted palm oil concessions  may become stranded by 2040 if conservation efforts proceed in line with these international  commitments and the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement.18     Section 3: Importance of Mitigating Risks Associated with the Forest, Food, and Land Sector     Increased transparency through FDIC regulation would move toward achieving the following  goals:     1. Natural capital and tropical commodity supply chain disclosures and assurances would allow  financial institutions to compare results across companies. Currently, quantitative metrics,  reporting frameworks, topics, and formats vary widely, which creates a barrier for financial  institutions without deep subject matter expertise or resources to access paid analysis.  Standardized climate-related disclosures, including tropical agriculture dependencies, would    13 Ellen Heimpel, “Industries and sectors driving deforestation: what you need to know,” Ecologi, May 14, 2021,  https://ecologi.com/articles/blog/industries-and-sectors-driving-deforestation-what-you-need-to-know.  14 Niamh McCarthy and Matthew Piotrowski, “Climate-Related Forest, Food, and Land Risks Threaten US Financial Stability,”  Climate Advisers, January 2021, https://www.climateadvisers.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Climate-Advisers-Climate- Related-Forest-Food-and-Land-Risks-Threaten-US-Financial-Stability.pdf  15 Bureau of Economic Analysis, https://www.bea.gov/data.  16 Pendrill, Florence, U.

7      provide a more complete picture of long-term risk for financial institutions. If the negative  social and environmental externalities associated with some tropical commodity producers are  internalized over time (carbon adjustments, changing water cycles, temperature increases,  government conservation efforts), financial institutions will face increasing risk.     2. Natural capital and tropical commodity supply chain disclosure and assurance requirements  would allow financial institutions to better understand the misallocation of resources toward  activities that worsen the climate crisis, including deforestation and land use change.  Standardized, consistent, comparable, and accurate disclosures would prevent information  asymmetries for financial institutions. Currently, only some companies have the resources to  use satellite monitoring services and conduct extensive research to be assured that they are  not sourcing commodities from producers linked to deforestation, fires, land disputes, or  human rights abuses. This represents a market failure that disadvantages financial institutions  that lend to or provide credit to companies that do not have these transparency measures.     3. Failing to address the climate crisis is likely to result in clear physical and transition risks  across sectors, limiting long-term capital formation in the U.S. economy. If FDIC regulations  are not broad enough to include AFOLU, tropical commodities produced on deforested land  will enter the U.S. economy and expose the financial system to undisclosed risk. Furthermore,  the related greenhouse gas emissions and destruction of carbon sinks will heighten exposure  of unrelated U.S. sectors to physical and transition risks, due to the global impacts of climate  change.               Section 4: Impact pathways of forest, food, and land risk  There is growing evidence that forest-related risks are negatively affecting the financial sector.  Investors have seen material impact from company connections to deforestation. Companies that  operate in tropical forest commodities have experienced suspensions from sustainability  organizations, loss of buyers for their products, divestment from investors, substantial reputation  risk, and loss in equity value. Consumer-facing downstream companies that source from tropical  commodity supply chains contend with reputation risks, changing consumer demand, and  increasing risk of supply chain disruptions. Below is a brief summary of the types of climate change  risks in forest, food, and land, according to TCFD classifications.  Physical risk:   1. Deforestation exacerbates the physical risk from climate change by reducing the capacity of  carbon sinks, eroding fertile soil, changing local precipitation patterns, and increasing the 
8      likelihood of more extreme weather events. These changes are, in turn, likely to lead to lower  agricultural yields and stranded assets.19   2. North America is reliant on ecosystem services from healthy intact tropical forests to regulate  precipitation patterns vital to agricultural production, inspire medical breakthroughs, prevent  mass migration, and curb the emergence of infectious diseases like Covid-19, and much  more.20   Transition risk:   1. Policy and legal risks result from government policy changes, litigation, or law enforcement.   a. The COP26 agreement that resulted in pledges from over 140 countries to halt  deforestation by 2030 is likely to accelerate conservation efforts for high conservation  value and high carbon stock land.21 For example, in Indonesia, as much as 76 percent  of unplanted palm oil concessions may experience legal or economic stranding by 2040  due to conservation efforts in line with international pledges and the country’s  Nationally Determined Contribution. 22  b. Orbitas Finance estimates that conservation efforts globally will result in a 52 percent  decrease in the availability of agricultural land, which would increase the cost of  agricultural expansion and, in turn, global commodity prices.23   c. International momentum on carbon pricing is estimated to further increase operating  costs of emissions-intensive agricultural producers by as much as 14 percent.24  Similarly, carbon border adjustments will have ripple effects across supply chains.   d. Supply chain due diligence obligations in Europe are also likely to require businesses  to prove their products and services are deforestation-free, which could negatively  impact global businesses if they are not prepared or have not developed the resources  to do so.25  e. Legal actions are increasingly being taken against high emitting companies that are  responsible for escalating climate-related damages.26     19 Niamh McCarthy and Matthew Piotrowski, “Climate-Related Forest, Food, and Land Risks Threaten US Financial Stability,”  Climate Advisers, January 2021, https://www.climateadvisers.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Climate-Advisers-Climate- Related-Forest-Food-and-Land-Risks-Threaten-US-Financial-Stability.pdf  20 Id.  21 Jake Spring and Simon Jessop, “Over 100 global leaders pledge to end deforestation by 2030,” Reuters, November 2021,  https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/over-100-global-leaders-pledge-end-deforestation-by-2030-2021-11-01/  22 Orbitas, “Climate Transition Risk Analyst Brief: Indonesian Palm Oil“, August 2021,  https://orbitas.finance/2021/08/27/indonesian-palm-oil-deforestation-climate-transition-risk/  23 Orbitas, “Agriculture in the Age of Climate Transitions: Stranded Assets.

9      2. Technology risks originate from disruptive innovations or the rise of substitute products.  a. In a world with land availability constraints due to forest conservation, supply chains  that prioritize emissions reduction technologies and investments that increase  productivity will be more resilient to supply chain disruptions.27  b. Alternatively, a lack of investment into new agroforestry techniques and technologies  may also lead to lower yields than competitors or reduced resilience to climate change.   3. Market risks arise from quickly changing market dynamics.   a. Consumer demand for low carbon and deforestation-free sourcing has increased No  Deforestation, No peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) requirements in consumer goods  companies, manufacturers, and retailers. In turn, NDPE policies now cover around 83  percent of palm oil refineries.28 On the other hand, companies without effective  mechanisms to prevent deforestation in supply chains risk market access declines as  trends in consumer preferences continue.  b. As countries committed to halting deforestation, 10 of the largest global agricultural  commodity traders, including Cargill, JBS, Bunge, Marfrig, Golden Agri-Resources,  and Wilmar International, also announced deforestation pledges.29 As the industry  moves toward no-deforestation policies and monitoring, climate laggards risk a  declining market and rising input costs due to upstream physical and operational risks.   c. Over 30 financial institutions with USD 8.7 trillion in assets under management  committed to ending investment in deforestation-linked activities, which may  jeopardize access to credit for companies that do not mitigate these risks.30  4. Reputational risks are driven by actions that damage a company’s public image.   a. These risks are on the rise as investors and consumers alike are demanding that  companies align products and services with global emissions-reduction goals and no- deforestation policies.   b. Companies face increased scrutiny from NGOs, consumers, and governments if  deforestation risk is not disclosed.  c. In a world where news of controversies spreads quickly and more than 50 percent of  consumers in Western countries are willing to pay a premium for sustainable products,  companies risk material financial impacts when links to deforestation and human rights  abuses emerge.31    27 Orbitas, “Agriculture in the Age of Climate Transitions: Stranded Assets.

10      Physical climate risks are already being felt by companies and will intensify if deforestation tipping  points are surpassed and global water cycle disruptions impact agricultural outputs. Climate  transition risks are quickly materializing as governments, international organizations, private  sector players, and consumers take action to prevent deforestation. Below are a few examples of  companies that have experienced significant financial impacts as a result of of deforestation risks:         1. Palm Oil Companies Suspended From Sustainability Markets. From 2015-2019, the equity  value of four palm oil companies fell by $1.1 billion due to suspensions from No Deforestation,  No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) supply chains.32 The four palm oil companies, Sawit  Sumbermas Sarana (SSMS), Austindo Nusantara Jaya (ANJ), Tunas Baru Lampung, and  Indofood Agri Resources, were suspended for deforestation, peatland clearing, or worker  abuses. Under NDPE supply chain rules, buyers and sellers commit to sustainability standards  or risk being suspended. Analysis from Chain Reaction Research shows that the four  companies saw $8 million to $50 million in quarterly revenues, gross profit, EBITDA, and net  profit per company, while also experiencing higher receivables, inventories, and net debt.33  The suspensions cut the companies off from selling to market actors – such as Unilever, Nestle,  and Wilmar – with strict sustainability criteria, limiting their options and market access.   2. IOI Corporation. IOI Corporation, a Malaysian palm oil company, saw material impact after  being suspended from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) for illegally clearing  forested land. After the RSPO suspended IOI Corporation, its share price fell by 18 percent  and 27 companies – including major commodity traders and large food companies like  Mondelez, Procter & Gamble, and Kellogg’s – halted purchases of IOI Corporation’s palm oil.34  Once IOI Corporation addressed its deforestation-related sustainability issues in its supply  chains, it regained its RSPO membership, saw its equity value recover, and re-established its  relationship with its buyers.   3. JBS. Brazilian meatpacker JBS has seen repeated material impacts from its ties to  deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In 2020, Nordea Asset Management sold its shares in  JBS over ESG concerns, including deforestation. The action by Nordea reflected longstanding  concerns that NGOs and financiers have had over the company’s corruption and  environmental record. These reputation risks have also contributed to increased scrutiny,  which have undermined JBS’ multiple attempts to launch an initial public offering in the United  States. JBS had initially wanted to launch the U.S. IPO in 2017.35 But scandals prompted the    accenture/accenture-chemicals-global-consumer-sustainability-survey-2019; Toluna, 2019 Sustainability Report: Consumers Hold  Brands Responsible: http://go.toluna-group.com/l/36212/2019-10-30/5p7ppd; First Insight, The State of Consumer Spending  2020: https://www.firstinsight.com/white-papers-posts/gen-z-shoppers-demand-sustainability.  32 Chain Reaction Research, “Palm Oil Growers Suspended Over Deforestation Lose USD 1.1B in Equity Value,” August 2019,   https://chainreactionresearch.com/report/palm-oil-growers-suspended-over-deforestation-lose-usd-usd-1-1b-in-equity-value/  33 Id.  34 Chain Reaction Research, “The Chain: IOI Corporation Commits To Improving its Supply Chain Risk Management,” May 2017,  https://chainreactionresearch.com/2278-2/  35 United States Securities and Exchange Commission, “JBS Foods International B.V., 2011,  https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1691004/000119312516785274/d304020df1.htm

They emphasize the importance of an economy-wide approach that includes all climate-related risks, particularly those related to deforestation in the agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) sector. The organization highlights the significant financial risks posed by deforestation, including physical and transition risks, and recommends aligning FDIC guidance with international frameworks like the TCFD and TNFD. They stress the need for financial institutions to disclose how they manage climate risks related to tropical deforestation, as sectors representing 40% of the U.S. economy are exposed to these risks. Climate Advisers also suggest monitoring key forest ecosystems at risk of collapse and analyzing potential impacts on financial stability. They argue that increased transparency and standardized disclosures would help financial institutions better understand and manage these risks, ultimately protecting the U.S. financial system from the systemic threats posed by deforestation."

Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street, NW  Washington, DC 20429    RE: Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions; Comment Request (RIN 3064-ZA32)    Dear Mr. Sheesley:    Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft principles on Climate-related Financial Risk  Management (RIN 3064-ZA32). While we understand that the draft principles are currently directed at  banks with $100 billion in assets and above, we are concerned that smaller banks will come under these  requirements in the future, and we wanted to be sure to share our concerns about the potential  negative impacts of this initiative as you begin this process.    First Community Bank commenced operations in August 1995, in the State of South Carolina. The Bank’s  primary federal regulator is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). We engage in the  commercial banking business from our main offices in Lexington, SC and our 21 full service offices  located in: the Midlands of South Carolina, which includes Lexington County (6 offices), Richland County  (4 offices), Newberry County (2 offices) and Kershaw County (1 office); the Upstate of South Carolina,  which includes Greenville County (2 offices), Anderson County (1 office) and Pickens County (1 office);  and the Central Savannah River Area, which includes Aiken County, South Carolina (1 office); and in  Augusta, Georgia, which includes Richmond County (2 offices) and Columbia County (1 office). In  addition, we have opened a loan production office in York County, South Carolina.     At December 31, 2021, the bank had approximately $1.6 billion in assets. First Community is a full- service commercial bank offering deposit and loan products and services, residential mortgage lending,  and financial planning / investment advisory services for businesses and consumers.       First Community Bank has a robust risk management system that is incorporated into all our business  decisions as is prudent to ensure sound financial management for both our shareholders and our  customers. We support the American Bankers Association (ABA) position that “prudential regulations  should continue to focus on actual risks banks face”. We are concerned that additional requirements for  specifically climate-related risk management will add a significant compliance burden for banks of our  size that will negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and our communities and require  significant expansion of our existing risk management process. Additionally, until climate-related  financial risk is better understood and able to be more precisely measured, the actual risk assessment  would be unduly subjective in nature.     
Again, thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the draft principles. The purpose of our  bank is to impact lives for success and significance. We are ever watchful for potentially negative  impacts on our ability to serve our customers and our shareholders. We wanted to take this opportunity  to share our concerns about the direction of this new initiative.    Sincerely,      Michael C. Crapps  Chief Executive Officer","The comment, submitted by Michael C. Crapps, CEO of First Community Bank, addresses concerns regarding the draft principles on Climate-related Financial Risk Management for large financial institutions. While the current focus is on banks with assets over $100 billion, there is apprehension that smaller banks, like First Community Bank with $1.6 billion in assets, may eventually be subject to these requirements. The bank, which operates primarily in South Carolina and Georgia, emphasizes its robust risk management system and aligns with the American Bankers Association's stance that regulations should focus on actual risks. Crapps argues that additional climate-related risk management requirements could impose a significant compliance burden, potentially hindering the bank's ability to serve its customers and communities. He also notes that climate-related financial risks are not yet well understood, making risk assessments subjective. The comment concludes by reiterating the bank's commitment to serving its customers and shareholders while expressing concerns about the potential negative impacts of the proposed initiative."

I am the Senior Vice President and Risk Officer  of American Bank, a $700 million community bank located in Bozeman, Montana. We primarily provide  commercial construction and general commercial loans. I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the  future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community banks. Such application may  significantly impact our ability to remain competitive. Even if not directly applied to community banks,  such regulation may have the unintended consequences that, to remain competitive, community banks  may need to comply (similar to interchange income constraints for large banks that de facto require  smaller banks to adhere to in order to remain competitive). Specifically: - Costs associated with scenario  analysis; - Hiring qualified experts to perform scenario analysis; and - Gathering more data from  customers. Further, we already implement stress testing on our loan portfolio as part of CECL and  consider climate issues in our Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery program. Thank you for the  opportunity to submit comments on the proposed framework as well as currently limiting this proposal  to banks with more than $100 billion in assets. Please conduct outreach with community bankers to  better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.    Andrew R. Kostyal   Bozeman, MT","Andrew R.

I am President and CEO of Claremont Savings  Bank, a $500 million mutual bank with offices in western New Hampshire and eastern Vermont.  I think  the efforts of the FDIC to focus on ""climate risk"" are inappropriate and beyond its mandate. It will  require banks to produce meaningless information that will provide no benefit to the bank or the  regulators. We already do a good job of considering risks to our borrowers and the institution.  It  appears that the goal is not to address risk management but to prod banks not to fund companies in  unfavored sectors. In the Northeast, we are dependent of fuel oil for heating most of our homes and gas  for heating and electricity. We are already having issues with energy prices as pipeline construction is  stalled and too much renewable energy is added to the grid. Continued increases in prices will hurt our  consumers, local businesses and the overall economy.  This seems to be a political campaign by the FDIC  and other federal entities and will be viewed as such by most of the regulated entities. If the  administration changes, there would be a reversal. It is not healthy for us to have what should be stable  risk management guidance whipsawed back and forth depending on the administration in power.  I  know this policy change is intended for the larger banks, but their risk is not climate risk. It is the risk of  falling out of favor with the regulators. We need those banks to support our energy sector, or we will all  suffer.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment. It is frustrating to see our regulators take political  positions.    Sincerely,    Reginald Greene   Claremont, NH","Reginald Greene, President and CEO of Claremont Savings Bank, criticizes the FDIC's focus on climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions, arguing it is beyond the FDIC's mandate and will produce unnecessary information. He believes the initiative is politically motivated, aiming to discourage banks from funding certain sectors, particularly energy, which is crucial in the Northeast. Greene highlights existing energy price issues due to stalled pipeline construction and increased renewable energy, warning that further price hikes will harm consumers and the economy. He expresses concern that such policies could change with different administrations, leading to instability in risk management guidance. Greene emphasizes the need for banks to support the energy sector to avoid economic suffering."

Our loan portfolio at  March 31, 2022 consisted of 32% Ag with the balance primarily in Commercial loans. Our total capital  ratio stands at 18.71%, which is 10.71 % over that ratio for being considered ""Well Capitalized"". I do not  believe a separate risk-management framework for climate-related financial risk is necessary to manage  safety and soundness at my bank or any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets. Our  existing risk management practices are effective and have enabled us to serve our community for 106  years through many uncertain times as enumerated above. Unlike large banks, we do not pose systemic  risk to the financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related  financial risk management framework designed for large complex institutions. This framework would be  expensive to establish and would unnecessarily duplicate current risk management practices that have  served us well. Scenario analysis would be expensive to establish, would require specialized third-party  expertise, and should not be mandatory for community banks like ours. This scenario would require  analysis for transition risks by gathering climate data from our customers. I am not aware of any of our  customers who would be sophisticated enough to maintain this type of data. This analysis would require  my bank to forecast for remote and speculative risks that would be of little practical utility to the  regulator or us. Qualified experts that could perform this analysis are not located in our area. We  currently stress test our loan portfolio for financial risk as well as conduct independent audits and  independent loan reviews. We continually monitor our local economic conditions and take appropriate  actions as dictated. This has served us well for 106 years. Thank you for the opportunity to submit  comments on the proposed framework. I appreciate the proposal is only affecting banks of $100 billion  in assets, but I am concerned that community banks may be next. I would encourage you to conduct  outreach with community bankers to better understand why this proposal should never apply to  community banks.    Sincerely,    Kent Carruthers, President Citizens Bank of Clovis Clovis, NM","Kent Carruthers, President of Citizens Bank of Clovis, expresses concerns about the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework for large financial institutions. Although his bank does not fall under this category, he worries about potential trickle-down effects on smaller community banks. Carruthers argues that a separate climate risk framework is unnecessary for community banks like his, which have effectively managed risks through existing practices for over a century. He highlights the bank's resilience through historical economic challenges and its strong capital ratio. Carruthers contends that the proposed framework would be costly, duplicative, and impractical for small banks, as it would require specialized expertise and data collection beyond their capabilities.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large institutions. I have been with Commercial Bank, in St. Louis County,  Missouri for 25 years and a state bank examiner for 7 years prior. We are a community bank with about  $300 million in assets after 34 years of business. We offer consumer and business products to our areas  and the largest volume of our loans are to small business. These loans include lines of credit, equipment  lending and real estate loans for their businesses.  While climate change is real and a concern, the  proposed framework for managing climate-related financial risk management for large banks will  negatively impact my community. Not only costs to financial institutions, but also to businesses. We  already comply with environmental rules and regulations and the added measures seem to complicate  costs associated with becoming greener.  Our concern is that it will filter down to community banks and  as my 32 years has shown, it eventually gets put upon all banks. Currently, financial institutions already  deal with severe weather events in our risk management as well as our reserve for loan losses. We have  had testing and preparation for these events for years as well as many of our larger businesses and  unfortunately, we have also been thru them.  The proposal gets down to what scenarios are being  proposed and the analysis of each. The cost and time will be prohibited for a community bank as this  type of analysis is performed by Wall Street firms, not bankers who deal with the communities deposits.  We would need to hire and implement these will cause the vast majority of smaller to mid-size  institutions to sell, because we make money on the margin, not from brokerage/insurance/etc. and  there is only so much money we make.  Our customers are small and would not be able to gather the  information as they are not that sophisticated or staffed. So they would need people to comply and this  would force the same thought. They only make so much money and if they can't make money, they will  close their business.  While it sounds great and climate change should be addressed, the proposed risk  management is dangerous to small businesses, including banks, as the compliance costs will cause  several to exit. We serve those types of business by a large margin, not the big institutions, and if small  business are forced out, so our the small bank.  Please keep in mind, these proposals almost always hit  small institutions as some point.    Nathan Bartlett   Executive Vice President   Commercial Bank   Saint Louis, MO","Nathan Bartlett, Executive Vice President of Commercial Bank in Saint Louis, MO, expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework for large institutions. He argues that while climate change is a valid concern, the proposed measures could negatively impact community banks and small businesses due to increased compliance costs. Bartlett highlights that community banks, like his, already manage risks associated with severe weather events and comply with existing environmental regulations. He fears that the new framework, designed for large institutions, will eventually trickle down to smaller banks, forcing them to incur prohibitive costs for analysis typically conducted by Wall Street firms. This could lead to smaller banks and businesses being unable to sustain operations, potentially resulting in closures. Bartlett urges consideration of the disproportionate impact on small institutions and businesses, emphasizing their role in serving local communities."
2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-063,"June 3, 2022    VIA ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION  James P. Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention: Comments—RIN 3064—ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429    Re:  Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large  Financial Institutions (RIN 3064—ZA32)    Ladies and Gentlemen:  The Financial Services Forum (the “Forum”)1 appreciates the opportunity to submit this  letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) on its proposed  principles (the “Proposal”) for climate-related financial risk management for large  financial institutions.  The Proposal is relevant to each of our member institutions, the  eight U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies (“U.S. GSIBs”).  At the outset, we wish to highlight that we welcome the Proposal, subject to certain  changes discussed further below, for a number of reasons.  Our members recognize the  need for banks to have robust capabilities for the safe and sound management of  exposures to climate-related financial risks, and in fact, already have taken important  steps to incorporate such risks into their comprehensive, enterprise risk management  frameworks.  Accordingly, the Forum supports the FDIC’s efforts, as well as the efforts  of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”), to establish guidance for  banks to address climate-related financial risks.                                                    1   The Financial Services Forum is an economic policy and advocacy organization whose members are  the chief executive officers of the eight largest and most diversified financial institutions  headquartered in the United States.  Forum member institutions are a leading source of lending and  investment in the United States and serve millions of consumers, businesses, investors, and  communities throughout the country.  The Forum promotes policies that support savings and  investment, deep and liquid capital markets, a competitive global marketplace and a sound financial  system. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  2      Below, we comment on the specific principles from the Proposal that we support and  highlight areas where the FDIC’s guidance in the Proposal could be recalibrated.  We  also provide responses to certain questions posed by the FDIC throughout our letter, as  indicated.  Our key observations and recommendations are as follows:   We welcome the guidance.  The Forum recognizes the emerging risks to banks  presented by climate change and the importance of having robust capabilities to  manage banks’ exposures to such risks.  Indeed, our member institutions already  have taken steps to incorporate climate-related financial risks into their risk  management frameworks.  The Proposal is helpful for understanding the FDIC’s  particular areas of focus with respect to the management of climate-related  financial risks, and we welcome FDIC guidance in this area as our member  institutions work on strengthening and refining their climate-related financial risk  management processes over time.   Support for scenario analysis rather than traditional stress testing.  The  Forum supports the use of scenario analysis, which can provide insights into a  range of tailored scenarios.  Scenario analysis should focus on material exposures  and incorporate plausible scenarios, particularly with respect to transition risk.   We also appreciate the distinction the Proposal makes between scenario analysis  and traditional stress testing, which could result in adverse regulatory  consequences, as gaps in data availability and methodology make regulatory  consequences inappropriate.    Support for principles and risk-based, flexible approach.  The Forum supports  high-level principles that enable banks to have flexibility to incorporate climate- related financial risks into their existing risk management frameworks and  processes where appropriate.  In addition, we support a risk-based approach that  considers the unique characteristics of each bank and allows banks to focus on  targeting material climate-related financial risks.  Given the evolving nature of the  risks, data and tools, we also urge the FDIC to adopt a “phased approach” so that  banks have sufficient time to meet supervisory expectations, in particular relating  to incorporation of and reliance on quantitative metrics.   Oppose a new requirement to consider impacts on broader aspects of the  economy.  The Proposal seemingly introduces a novel requirement in the  introductory preamble language, stating: “the manner in which financial  institutions manage climate-related financial risks to address safety and soundness  concerns should also seek to reduce or mitigate the impact that management of  these risks may have on broader aspects of the economy.”2  This requirement                                                    2   Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions, 87 Fed. Reg. 19507, 19509 (Apr. 4, 2022).  
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  3      appears to be sweepingly broad and vague, and without statutory basis.3   Moreover, it would be inappropriate for the FDIC to expect financial institutions  as part of their risk management practices to consider impacts on the broader  economy, which could conflict with the institution’s practices that are necessary  to promote safety and soundness.  Accordingly, we recommend that the final  guidance eliminate this language from the preamble.  1.  We support the Proposal’s endorsement of scenario analysis, in particular,  rather than regulatory stress testing, to assess and manage climate-related  financial risks.  a.  Scenario analysis is the preferred method of evaluating climate-related  financial risks.    The Proposal recommends scenario analysis as an “important approach for identifying,  measuring, and managing climate-related risks.”  In doing so, the Proposal explicitly  distinguishes scenario analysis from “traditional stress testing exercises that typically  assess the potential impacts of transitory shocks to near-term economic and financial  conditions.”  We agree that scenario analysis is more appropriate than traditional stress  testing, and this approach is consistent with the approaches supported by other U.S.  regulators, including OCC, Federal Reserve Board (“Federal Reserve”) and the Financial  Stability Oversight Committee (“FSOC”).  Scenario analysis is a much more suitable tool to evaluate the potential economic and  financial risks posed by different climate outcomes.  A key difference between stress  testing and scenario analysis is that traditional stress testing may be associated with  regulatory requirements,4 with respect to which the failure to comply can result in  supervisory consequences and limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus  payments.5  As discussed in greater detail below, banks face significant challenges in  identifying and measuring climate-related financial risks, particularly around data.  Given  the gaps in currently available data, models and methods used to assess climate-related  financial risks, it would be inappropriate for banks to experience adverse regulatory  consequences as a result of quantitative assessments that rely on currently available data  and methodologies.                                                    3   See, e.g., 12 U.S.C. § 1831p-1.   4   See, e.g., Financial Stability Oversight Council, Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk, at 90 (Oct.  2021) [hereinafter, “FSOC Report”]; Jerome Powell Remarks, Green Swan Conference, hosted by the  Bank for International Settlements (Jun. 4, 2021) [hereinafter, “Powell Remarks”] (stating that  scenario analysis is “not meant to be setting up a regulatory consequence, which obviously does flow  from our regulatory stress tests”).  5   12 C.F.R. 217.11(c)(1). 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  4      In contrast, scenario analysis does not necessarily result in direct regulatory consequences  and “may contemplate much longer time horizons in order to assess medium- and long- term business model resilience against the changes in climate-related risks that may  materialize over such longer horizons.”6  Stress testing necessarily tends to focus on  shorter time horizons7 and would be unable to account for the fact that climate-related  financial risks could “evolve over various time horizons,” including “those that extend  beyond the bank’s typical strategic planning horizon,” as noted in the Proposal’s  “Governance” principle.  Therefore, a tool like scenario analysis, which can explore a  range of potential scenarios over long-term horizons, would be better suited as a more  flexible risk management tool for guarding against climate-related financial risks.    Lastly, the Federal Reserve has itself distinguished between scenario analysis and stress  testing8 and is currently developing a program of climate-related scenario analysis.9   Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in his re-nomination hearing reiterated support for  scenario analysis rather than traditional stress tests: “I think it’s very likely that climate  stress scenarios, as we like to call them, will be a key tool going forward.  I would stress  that those are very different from the regular stress tests which affect capital.”10   Governor Lael Brainard reiterated that she is not currently advocating including climate- related financial risks in traditional stress tests during her nomination hearing: “I certainly  have not stated that we should do climate stress tests.”11  The FSOC Report on Climate- Related Financial Risk (the “FSOC Report”) also strongly recommended that member  agencies use scenario analysis, but stopped short of recommending climate stress testing  akin to the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests or the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital  Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) program.12                                                    6   FSOC Report, supra note 4; see also Lael Brainard, “Financial Stability Implications of Climate  Change” (Mar. 23, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20210323a.htm  [hereinafter, “Brainard Remarks”].  7   See, e.g., FSOC Report, supra note 4 (noting that “stress tests within the remit of regulators tend to  focus on a shorter time horizon in order to determine the solvency and liquidity of an institution given  an ‘extreme but plausible’ market risk or set of macroeconomic shocks”); 12 C.F.R. 225.8(d)(16)  (defining “planning horizon” for capital planning purposes to include a period of at least nine  consecutive quarters); 12 C.F.R. 252.35(a)(4) (requiring liquidity stress testing to be conducted using  overnight, 30-day, 90-day and one-year planning horizons).  8   See, e.g., Powell Remarks, supra note 4; Brainard Remarks, supra note 6.  9   See, e.g., Federal Reserve, Financial Stability Report, at 63 (Nov. 2021),  https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-20211108.pdf.  10   Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Nomination Hearing (Jan. 11, 2022).  11   Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Nomination Hearing (Jan. 13, 2022).  12   FSOC Report, supra note 4, at 90  (“Scenario analysis is similar to, but distinct from, stress testing as  deployed by financial regulators, such as the supervisory Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests of the Federal  Reserve Board, OCC, and FDIC and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)  performed by the Federal Reserve Board on the largest banking organizations.”).  
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  5      b.  Response to questions regarding scenario analysis.13  The FDIC has asked for feedback on how banks currently use climate scenario analysis  and which factors would be most salient to consider when designing these exercises in  the future.  We highlight some observations and challenges about climate scenario  analysis based on the experience of our member institutions and recommend certain  features of scenario analysis that the FDIC should support in its final guidance.  i.  Observations and challenges.   Forum member institution practices.  Forum member institutions already  engage in climate scenario analysis as part of their broader risk management  program to measure, monitor and assess their exposure to climate-related  financial risks.  These analyses are focused on identifying and sizing climate- related financial risks in their asset portfolios so that these risks can be monitored  and managed on an ongoing basis.  In formulating climate scenarios, our member  institutions focus their scenarios on the most prominent likely exposures that  would be impacted by climate change, subjecting certain asset portfolios to  climate scenario analysis rather than conducting enterprise-wide scenario  analysis.    For example, some of our member institutions designed scenarios to examine the  impacts of two short-term transition risk pathways on a sample portfolio of  companies in the oil and gas value chain.  One of these pathways was based on  rapid electric vehicle adoption and the other was based on the adoption of a global  carbon tax.  Focusing on this portfolio allowed our member institutions to analyze  the financial impacts of each pathway across different segments of the value chain  within the oil and gas industry.   Gaps in data and modeling.  As discussed in greater detail below, existing data  and tools to measure and quantify climate-related financial risk—and in particular  longer-term transition and physical risks—are only just emerging, and will need  to undergo substantial exploration, refinement and adaptation over time.  Data  gaps, and uncertainty given the unprecedented nature of climate change, present a  significant challenge for banks because the reliability of the scenario analysis  results depends on the reliability of the underlying data.  While climate-related  data has improved in both quantity and quality over the past several years, there  are still considerable gaps that frustrate attempts to accurately identify climate-                                                   13   This section is responsive to Questions 13 and 14 posed by the FDIC, respectively: “Scenario analysis  is an important component of climate risk management that requires assumptions about plausible  future states of the world. How do financial institutions use climate scenario models, analysis, or tools  and what challenges do they face?” and “What factors are most salient for the FDIC to consider when  designing and executing scenario analysis exercises?” 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  6      related financial risks.  In particular, our member institutions have highlighted  data gaps regarding physical risks, such as the possibility that specific locations  will experience extreme weather events and the geographic location of physical  assets of companies.  One of our member institutions conducted a scenario  analysis to identify areas exposed to significant physical risks by mapping the  bank’s exposures by geography and then cross-referencing these global  geographies against potential hot spots for physical climate impacts.  The more  reliable the geographic data, the more useful such exercises will be.  As another example, publicly available climate scenarios do not provide banks  with the appropriate sectoral and regional granularity to directly translate scenario  output into readily consumable inputs for internal risk modeling.  For banks, the  value of climate scenario analysis can only be fully realized when the science- based or macroeconomic output is expanded into more granular financial impacts  that can be applied across a diverse set of client industries and sub-sectors.  There  is also a limited understanding of the Integrated Assessment Models that drive  these scenarios, which makes it more challenging for banks and vendors alike to  expand scenario output while staying within the bounds of the model.   Time horizons.  The long-term nature of climate change poses significant  challenges for modeling climate-related financial risks, but striking the right  balance between accounting for long-term climate change and doing so within an  actionable framework is critical.  As discussed above, financial risks are generally  considered over the short to medium-term horizon and are generally assessed over  one to three years.  Climate scenario analysis over substantially longer horizons  presents two important challenges.  First, risk management decisions are not  generally made with respect to lengthy time horizons.  Second, the uncertainty  around risks of any type grow quickly with the time horizon.  Long time horizons  lead to a wide range of uncertainty about the evolution of climate-related financial  risks that make interpreting any findings difficult.  Relatedly, it is necessary to  make assumptions about how the evolution of the climate will impact economic  variables, such as trade, employment and the relative performance of different  economic sectors.  Making such forecasts in the near-term is difficult, and  understanding how the distant evolution of the climate relates to various  economic indicators is all the more challenging.  ii.  Recommendations.   We recommend the following for the FDIC’s final guidance regarding scenario analysis:    Phased approach.  As noted above, there are still significant data and modeling  gaps that affect the reliability of scenario analysis results.  Accordingly, as  discussed further below, we support a phased approach to climate risk 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  7      management, including for climate scenario analysis, while data becomes more  reliable, available and consistent.   Materiality thresholds should be incorporated.  A risk-based approach that  considers the unique characteristics of each bank and that allows banks to focus  on targeting material climate-related financial risks should apply to scenario  analysis as well.  The FDIC, for example, should permit banks to continue  focusing their scenarios on the most material likely exposures that would be  impacted by climate change, and subjecting only certain asset portfolios to  climate scenario analysis.   Banks should have flexibility in designing scenarios.  Although we would  appreciate high-level guidance on scenario analysis from regulators, we also  recommend that the FDIC give banks flexibility in the design of their scenarios.   This approach will ensure that the broad frame of the scenario is articulated  comprehensively while allowing individual firms to tailor the scenarios to the  specific needs of their asset portfolios.     Scenarios encompassing transition risks should be plausible.  Scenarios used  for scenario analysis may be severe and rigorous but should also be credible.   Scenarios keyed to tail risks that are too remote may result in risk measurements  that are not highly relevant.  Overall, the degree of severity in any climate  scenario must be appropriately balanced against its plausibility.  This balance  should be made explicit in a well-articulated and measurable standard that should  be employed to help ensure that climate scenarios, and in particular transition  risks, are empirically relevant and have the potential to result in actionable  outcomes.  Transition risk may be even harder to predict than physical risk  because it depends on the path of government policy.  Moreover, different  assumptions about the specific type and trajectory of policy can lead to  significantly different outcomes.  As an example, a transition risk scenario that  considers the rapid imposition of a large and widely applicable carbon tax would  have a significantly different impact than a transition risk scenario that is focused  more narrowly on policies targeting the fossil fuel industry.  FDIC guidance  should provide clear, high-level guidance on the nature and extent of transition  risk scenarios to be considered, and these scenarios should be plausible. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  8      2.  We support the Proposal’s flexibility in permitting climate-related financial  risks to be incorporated into existing risk management frameworks.  a.  Climate-related financial risk may be effectively addressed within existing  risk management frameworks, which already sufficiently account for  climate-related financial risks.14  Climate-related financial risk may be considered a transverse, cross-cutting risk in some  instances or a standalone risk in others.  As a result, in some circumstances it may be  more appropriate for banks to embed climate-related financial risks into existing risk  management frameworks and in others to create new, standalone frameworks.  The  Proposal appears to permit the approach of incorporating climate-related financial risks  into existing frameworks and systems where appropriate, and we believe the final  guidance should retain this flexible perspective.   In the Proposal, the FDIC explains that the draft principles are “consistent with the risk  management framework described in existing FDIC rules and guidance” and are intended  to “help bank management make progress toward … incorporating climate-related  financial risks into financial institutions’ risk management frameworks” (emphasis  added).  The “Governance” principle explicitly contemplates that “[r]esponsibility and  accountability may be integrated within existing organizational structures.”  As the Proposal acknowledges, existing risk management and corporate governance  standards applicable to large U.S. banking organizations are sufficiently broad and  flexible to accommodate climate-related financial risks as an integrated component.  For  example, the OCC safety and soundness regulations require large banks to update their  risk governance frameworks “at least annually, and as often as needed to address …  changes in the [] bank’s risk profile caused by emerging risks.”15                                                    14   This section is, in part, responsive to Questions 5 and 8 posed by the FDIC, respectively: “What  specific tools or strategies have financial institutions used to successfully incorporate climate-related  financial risks into their risk management frameworks?” and “What, if any, specific products,  practices, and strategies—for example, insurance or derivatives contracts or other capital market  instruments—do financial institutions use to hedge, transfer, or mitigate climate-related financial  risks?”  15   OCC Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large Insured National Banks,  Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches; Integration of Regulations, 79  Fed. Reg. 54517 (Sept. 11, 2014) [hereinafter, “OCC Heightened Standards”]; see also Enhanced  Prudential Standards for Bank Holding Companies and Foreign Banking Organizations, 79 Fed. Reg.  17239 (Mar. 27, 2014) [hereinafter, “Enhanced Prudential Standards”] (requiring that the risk  management frameworks of a large U.S. bank holding company “be commensurate with its structure,  risk profile, complexity, activities, and size,” and requiring subject institutions to implement broad  frameworks rather than targeted responses to enumerated risks and to adjust their frameworks as risks  and activities vary). 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  9      OCC regulations and standards also address many of the specific risk management and  internal control elements promoted in the Proposal, including without limitation for board  and senior management oversight, risk appetite framework, risk data aggregation and  reporting and internal controls.16  Large U.S. banks are already expected to consider their  material risks in capital planning, strategy development, credit portfolio management and  liquidity management, as well as the impact of material and emerging risks on other risk  categories, including liquidity, credit, market, strategic, operational and model risk.17   U.S. GSIBs, therefore, already have in place robust risk management frameworks and  practices that are designed to address material risks and are purposefully flexible to  enable the incorporation of responses to new and emerging risks.  In fact, as would be the  case for any other material risk, our member institutions already have been incorporating  climate-related financial risk analysis into their risk management practices.18    Our member institutions have worked to incorporate oversight of climate-related  financial risk into their existing governance structures by, in some instances, establishing  internal committees that consist of senior executives with specific purview over climate- related financial risk management.  For example, one of our member institutions has  established a climate risk team that is responsible for developing the bank’s internal  approach to managing climate-related financial risk, with the goal of integrating climate  considerations into existing risk management frameworks.  Forum member institutions employ a variety of effective strategies to mitigate climate- related financial risks and already generally prioritize risk management of assets and                                                    16  See, e.g., OCC Heightened Standards, supra note 15; OCC, Comptroller’s Handbook: Corporate and  Risk Governance (July 25, 2019), https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2019/bulletin- 2019-38.html [hereinafter, “OCC Corporate and Risk Governance Handbook”]; Enhanced Prudential  Standards, supra note 15; Federal Reserve, SR 21-3 / CA 21-1: Supervisory Guidance on Board of  Directors’ Effectiveness (Feb. 26, 2021) [hereinafter, “Federal Reserve SR 21-3”]; Federal Reserve  Board, Bank Holding Company Supervision Manual (Nov. 2021) (risk management processes and  internal controls), https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/bhc.pdf.   17   See, e.g., OCC Heightened Standards, supra note 15; OCC Corporate and Risk Governance  Handbook, supra note 16; Enhanced Prudential Standards (managing liquidity risk), supra note 15;  Federal Reserve SR 21-3, supra note 14; 12 C.F.R. 225.8(e)(2)(ii)(A); Federal Reserve, SR 15-18:  Federal Reserve Supervisory Assessment of Capital Planning and Positions for Firms Subject to  Category I Standards (revised Jan. 15, 2021); Federal Reserve, SR 15-19: Federal Reserve  Supervisory Assessment of Capital Planning and Positions for Firms Subject to Category II or III  Standards (revised Jan. 15, 2021); Federal Reserve, SR 10-6: Interagency Policy Statement on  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management (Mar. 17, 2010).  18   We also note that, to some extent, banks have historically been successfully managing climate-related  risks in conducting their activities.  See, e.g., Kristian S. Blickle et al., Federal Reserve Bank of New  York, How Bad Are Weather Disasters for Banks?, at 3 (Nov. 2021) [hereinafter, “NY Fed Staff  Report”] (discussing that “long run sea level rise may have already been priced into coastal  properties” and that “counties more exposed to sea level risk pay higher underwriting fees for  bonds”).  
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  10      clients in industries considered to be higher risk or high-carbon intensity.  For example,  to address idiosyncratic flood risk, our member institutions generally have policies in  place to require flood insurance when underwriting a mortgage if the location of the  property is in a flood plain.  Some of our member institutions are also taking into  consideration the client’s intended use of financing, geographic locations of operations  and ability to manage potential physical risk impacts.  Further, some of our member  institutions incorporate climate-related financial risks into overall credit assessment and  underwriting processes for certain industries and loans, like commercial real estate and  mortgages.  The Proposal suggests a new requirement for credit risk: “The board and management  should determine credit risk appetite and lending limits related to these [climate-related  financial] risks.”19  In line with existing risk identification processes, banks are  appropriately considering impacts of climate-related financial risks on the overall risk  appetite of the firm.  We do not think guidance should be so prescriptive as to require  changes to existing, or creation of new, credit risk appetite and lending limits as a result  of climate-related financial risk considerations.  As mentioned above, Forum member  institutions incorporate climate-related financial risks in their existing risk-management  programs, including credit assessments, and the final guidance should not mandate that  banks establish prescriptive lending limits.  In addition, we do not believe that a new type of regulatory or other external reporting  specifically directed at climate-related financial risk by banks from the banking  regulators is necessary at this point in time.20  All of our member institutions are already  engaged in voluntary reporting efforts through the Taskforce on Climate-Related  Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) as well as other industry-led reporting frameworks.21  In  addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) has proposed disclosure  rules for the enhancement and standardization of climate-related disclosures; the Forum  will be submitting comments on that proposal.22  In short, the final guidance should retain the Proposal’s approach of allowing banks the  flexibility to treat climate-related financial risk as a risk that may be integrated into                                                    19   87 Fed. Reg. at 19511.  20   This is responsive to Question 12 posed by the FDIC: “How could existing regulatory reporting  requirements be augmented to better capture financial institutions’ exposure to climate-related  financial risks?”  21   See TCFD, Core Recommendations, https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/recommendations/#core- recommendations; Carbon Disclosure Project, Climate Change 2021 Questionnaire (Jan. 2021),  https://guidance.cdp.net/en/guidance?cid=18&ctype=theme&idtype=ThemeID&incchild=1&microsit e=0&otype=Questionnaire&tags=TAG-13071%2CTAG-605%2CTAG-600.  22   See SEC, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, 87  Fed.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  11      banks’ existing risk management frameworks and reporting.  This not only would be  consistent with regulatory expectations that banks’ risk management frameworks  encompass all material risks to the bank,23 but also would enable banks to more  expeditiously address emerging climate-related financial risks.  b.  Time horizons should be consistent with how banks currently assess and  mitigate risk.24  The specific time horizon considered relevant for climate-related financial risks depends  on the specific use for which the analysis is employed.  A bank’s risk management and  stress testing time horizons generally are relatively short-term (e.g., less than three years  and often far shorter), in order to facilitate meaningful and realistic risk appetite and  business strategy planning.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”)  explains that traditional financial risk scenario analysis and stress testing use shorter time  frames because the uncertainty of the results increases with the timespan, as more  assumptions are required.25  As the Proposal’s Governance principle states, climate-related financial risks could  “evolve over various time horizons,” including “those that extend beyond the institution’s  typical strategic planning horizon.”  Although we agree climate change is a long-term  phenomenon, expectations around climate-related financial risk management should seek  a balance between the uncertain long-term effects of climate change and the need for  bank management to address the more immediate impacts in an effective manner  consistent with risk appetite and business planning.  For example, a 30-year time horizon  would be inconsistent with the risk management frameworks used by our member  institutions.    We recognize that scenario analyses may be conducted over longer time horizons, as  discussed above, but the time horizons used in overall climate-related financial risk  management frameworks should be consistent with current approaches to risk  management in order to facilitate incorporating climate-related financial risks into  existing practices.  Accordingly, we recommend that the final guidance give banks  flexibility to determine the appropriate time horizon depending on the purpose of the  analysis.                                                    23   See, e.g., OCC Heightened Standards, supra note 15.  24   This section is, in part, responsive to Question 7 posed by the FDIC: “What time horizons do banks  consider relevant when identifying and assessing the materiality of climate-related financial risks?”  25   See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-Related Financial Risks – Measurement  Methodologies (Apr. 2021), at 20–21, https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d518.pdf; Federal Reserve, The  Supervisory Capital Assessment Program: Design and Implementation (Apr. 24, 2009), at 3,  https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20090424a1.pdf. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  12      3.  We support the principles and risk-based framework discussed in the  Proposal and believe the final guidance should reflect this framework and  allow banks to focus on climate-related financial risks that are material to  them.  In the introduction to the Proposal, the FDIC explains that the draft principles are  intended to provide a “high-level framework for the safe and sound management of  exposures to climate-related financial risks” and to support banks’ efforts “to focus on  key aspects of climate risk management” (emphasis added).  The FDIC also notes that,  “[i]n keeping with the FDIC’s risk-based approach to supervision, the FDIC intends to  appropriately tailor any resulting supervisory expectations to reflect differences in banks’  circumstances such as complexity of operations and business models.”  The “Scenario  Analysis” principle also advises that management develop and implement scenario  analysis frameworks “in a manner commensurate to the institution’s size, complexity,  business activity, and risk profile.”  We support the use of these risk-based principles to support banks’ efforts to manage and  mitigate climate-related financial risks.  A risk-based framework will enable firms to  tailor the incorporation of climate-related financial risks into their risk management  frameworks based on a particular firm’s size, as well as the unique nature, scale and  complexity of its activities and business.  For example, we recognize that size and complexity of banking organizations can be  correlated with their potential to pose systemic risk.  For this reason, U.S. GSIBs are  taking climate-related financial risks very seriously and already have taken certain steps  to account for such risks in their governance and risk management frameworks.   That  said, there may be instances in which larger banks are less vulnerable to losses resulting  from climate disaster.  Notably, a recent staff report released by Federal Reserve Bank of  New York economists (“NY Fed Staff Report”) revealed that, in the case of extreme  weather events over the last quarter century, “losses at larger (multi-county) banks [were]  barely affected and their income increase[d] significantly with exposure,” whereas local  banks, which do not benefit from diversification across multiple geographies,  experienced more negative stability effects from extreme disasters.26  The flexibility that would be provided by a principles and risk-based framework would  allow each firm to focus on aspects of climate-related financial risks that are material to  the particular firm and avoid diverting resources to aspects that present less risk based on  the unique characteristics and activities of the firm.  For example, certain financial  instruments may not generate material climate-related financial risk, such as short-term  liquid financial instruments for which pricing and value at risk metrics already capture  the risk.  While our member institutions will certainly be monitoring for all categories of                                                    26   NY Fed Staff Report, supra note 18, at 1.  
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  13      risks and adjusting their internal controls as appropriate, focusing on the key material  risks within key affected business lines will allow our member institutions to manage  their exposure to climate-related financial risks in a manner that is most targeted and  efficient.    It is important that Forum member institutions be allowed to leverage existing risk  management practices and capabilities in assessing the materiality of an asset portfolio in  relation to climate-related risk management.  For example, our member institutions have  identified a variety of material climate-related financial risks based on their distinct  portfolios and exposures.27  Our member institutions generally have developed a process  to determine whether a risk is material that consists of: (1) identifying and assessing the  potential impacts of a risk, (2) ranking the likelihood of the occurrence of the particular  risk, (3) assessing and measuring the risk and (4) then making decisions based on that  assessment.  The material risks identified through this process inform the bank’s scenario  design and analysis, risk appetite and strategic planning.  Another example of a materiality determination is identifying portfolio sensitivity to  climate-related financial risks through both qualitative and quantitative analyses to gauge  the materiality of an asset portfolio’s sensitivity to climate change, such as rising sea  levels and increased incidences of extreme weather events, like wild fires and hurricanes.   This process often makes use of highly granular data, including the precise location of an  asset and its relation to relevant geographic features, such as proximity to a floodplain or  wildfire prone areas.  These analyses are then used to build an overall assessment of a  portfolio’s sensitivity to climate-related financial risks, which is then used to determine if  more intensive and granular scenario analysis would be warranted from a risk  measurement and management perspective.  4.  The final guidance should adopt a phased approach to requiring banks to  incorporate certain practices into their risk management frameworks.  For reasons discussed below, we believe the process for meeting supervisory expectations  regarding climate-related financial risks should be an iterative process.   First, we note that this specific guidance on climate-related financial risks is new,  although it draws from existing, more general guidelines.  Accordingly, an appropriate  timeframe will be required for banks to fully incorporate the practices discussed in the  Proposal into their risk management frameworks and systems.  Second, banks face a number of challenges in addressing climate-related financial risks,  including the following:                                                    27   This paragraph is, in part, responsive to Question 6 posed by the FDIC: “How do financial institutions  determine when climate-related financial risks are material and warrant greater than routine attention  by the board and management?” 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  14       Limitations on data, in particular, data “connecting the science of climate change  to financial risk assessments and real-world economic impacts”;28   The relatively new and evolving nature of models and methods employed for  climate scenario analysis relative to those used in traditional financial stress  testing, which may not currently be suitable for rigorously assessing granular  climate-related financial risks;     Uncertainty about the time horizons over which certain risks (e.g., transition risks,  longer-term risks) may manifest;29 and   The non-linear and complex nature of the impacts of climate change, which make  it difficult to forecast the frequency and intensity of severe climate events and  assess the interlinkages between climate-related pathways and economic and  financial variables across the financial system.30  The FSOC Report included a lengthy discussion of the challenges associated with  identifying and mitigating climate-related financial risks, particularly around data.  The  FSOC Report stated that “enhancing the availability of and access to relevant,  comprehensive data and developing methods and metrics to effectively utilize climate- related data and financial data” are “[n]ecessary steps for measuring and assessing  climate-related financial risk.”31    These challenges, as well as the evolving nature of climate-related financial risks,  necessitate an ongoing process for managing such risks.  The Proposal in fact states that  “[t]he FDIC recognizes that the incorporation of material climate-related financial risks  into various planning processes is iterative as measurement methodologies, models, and  data for analyzing these risks continue to evolve and mature over time.”32  Guidance  should take into account the limitations around currently available data and metrics when  setting expectations for banks.  To account for the time required for, and the challenges associated with, integrating  climate-related financial risks into banks’ risk management practices, we recommend that  the FDIC adopt an iterative or “phased approach.”  This would involve the FDIC phasing  in certain expectations as the data and tools become more reliable and in recognition that                                                    28   FSOC Report, supra note 4, at 23. These challenges are discussed in the FSOC Report as examples of  challenges that regulators face, but we believe they are also applicable to banks.  29   Id.  30   Id.  31   Id. at 47.    32   Proposal, “Strategic Planning” principle. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  15      banks will require transition periods to address emerging climate-related financial risks.   In particular, we strongly recommend that the final guidance explicitly recognize that  some expectations outlined in the principles cannot be executed based on quantitative  rather than qualitative metrics until banks have sufficient time to develop capabilities and  data and measurement tools have advanced to the degree that they can be sufficiently  relied upon to serve as a basis for a number of the expectations specified in the  guidelines.  For example, it would not currently be appropriate to incorporate climate- related financial risks into capital and liquidity planning processes.  It is important that  there be sufficient flexibility in climate modeling standards so that learning and  innovation can occur on an ongoing basis.  A phased approach that clearly sets out  gradual milestones for certain expectations would best reflect the evolving nature of  climate-related financial risks and support banks’ efforts to manage climate-related  financial risks in a manner that is effective, accurate and methodical.  5.  Certain of the principles and commentary should be clarified in the final    guidance.   We recommend that certain of the principles and commentary be clarified further in the  final guidance.      a.  Governance.    For the “Governance” principle, the FDIC should distinguish the roles and  responsibilities of bank boards and management with respect to risk management.  We  believe the FDIC should coordinate with the OCC and the Federal Reserve to ensure  consistency with respect to the scope of a board’s responsibility to oversee other risks  facing a financial institution. 33    b.  Public communication.    For the “Strategic Planning” principle, the FDIC should clarify the language regarding  public communication of climate-related strategies.  The Proposal calls for banks to  “ensure that any public statements about an institution’s climate-related strategies and  commitments are consistent with their internal strategies and risk appetite statements.”34   Specifically, we believe it would be more appropriate for each bank to ensure that public  communication of its climate-related strategies is consistent with the actions the bank is  actually taking.  This focus on accuracy aligns with the U.S. securities disclosure regime,                                                    33   See OCC, Director’s Book: Role of Directors for National Banks and Federal Savings Associations  (Nov. 2020), at 14–15, https://www.occ.gov/publications-and-resources/publications/banker- education/files/directors-book.html; Federal Reserve, SR 21-3 / CA 21-1: Supervisory Guidance on  Board of Directors’ Effectiveness (Feb. 26, 2021),   https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/SR2103.htm.   34   Proposal, “Strategic Planning” principle. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation    June 3, 2022  16      which requires accuracy in public statements.  We believe the current wording of this  expectation would benefit from clarification by stating that the FDIC’s focus in this area  is having banks avoid making materially inaccurate or untrue public statements regarding  climate-related financial risk plans, strategies or actions.  We also believe the responsibilities of the board and management with respect to public  communications regarding climate-related strategies could benefit from clarification.   The Proposal calls for both boards and management to “ensure” consistency between  public communications and internal strategies regarding climate-related strategies.  As  boards do not review a bank’s public communications except in extraordinary  circumstances, we recommend that the final guidance not assign the board responsibility  for ensuring alignment between public communications and internal climate-related  strategies.    6.  Regulatory agencies should cooperate so that there is one consistent set of  high-level standards applicable across an entire banking organization.   Banking organizations benefit from a consistent set of guidelines from banking  regulators.  We also reiterate our support for guidance, like the Proposal, that is  principles-based and high-level.  We appreciate the FDIC’s coordination with other  financial regulators and in particular the similarities between the Proposal and the OCC’s  proposed principles on climate-related financial risk management.35  We agree that the  federal banking agencies should take a consistent and coordinated approach to high-level  guidance relating to risk management frameworks for climate-related financial risk.    *  *  *  Thank you for considering these comments.

The FSF, representing the eight largest U.S. bank holding companies, supports the proposal but suggests several changes. Key points include: 

1. **Support for Scenario Analysis**: FSF endorses scenario analysis over traditional stress testing for assessing climate-related risks, emphasizing its flexibility and appropriateness given current data limitations.

2. **Risk-Based, Flexible Approach**: FSF advocates for high-level principles allowing banks to integrate climate risks into existing frameworks, tailored to each bank's unique characteristics.

3. **Opposition to Broader Economic Impact Requirement**: FSF opposes a requirement for banks to consider broader economic impacts in their risk management, citing lack of statutory basis and potential conflicts with safety and soundness practices.

4. **Phased Implementation**: FSF recommends a phased approach to implementing climate risk management practices, allowing time for data and methodologies to mature.

5. **Clarifications Needed**: FSF calls for clearer distinctions in governance roles and public communication expectations, and urges regulatory consistency across agencies."
2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-065_14,"Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      To Whom it May Concern: I am writing today in response to the FDIC's request for comment regarding  its statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management. We feel that it is only a matter  of time before this proposed ruling that is designed for institutions over $100 billion in assets will trickle  down to smaller community banks. This letter is in response to the FDIC's request for comment on its  statement of principles.  Shamrock Bank is a $420 million community bank located in Oklahoma. We are  90% owned by our employees via an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. We have locations in very rural,  low-income areas in Oklahoma. We are very community minded and understand that the success of our  locations in these areas, as well as the community, are reliant on each other. There is very little  economic activity in these communities and if they lose the bank or their school, the community  effectively dies.  As in many cases, proposed rulings by agencies that are intended to affect only the  largest banks ends up as issues for small community banks like ours. The proposed framework for  managing climate risk will do nothing but add additional costs and burdens to our community bank,  leaving fewer resources to invest back into our communities and employees. Banks like ours, especially  in Oklahoma and Texas, have dealt with climate crisis for decades. Tornados, floods, ice storms and  wildfires have all been annual occurrences. We feel that our response to climate issues has been proven  over the last two decades.  Furthermore, we have also survived busts in the energy sector since the  1980s. Over the last 2 decades as oil prices have risen and fallen in drastic swings, we have become very  astute in evaluating direct and secondary exposure in our loan portfolio. We strongly feel that CECL will  also add an additional level of reserves to limit exposure.  Lastly, should the requirements for climate- disclosure requirements be pushed on banks like ours it will severely restrict how banks operate in rural  areas. What is already a strain to keep these banks open will become impossible as resources are used  for meaningless disclosures that serve no purpose for the bank, the climate or the communities we  serve.  We pray that you understand and evaluate the cost / benefit of this proposed rulemaking. In  many cases, with small community banks, there will be no benefit and the cost will be devastating to  banks and communities.    Respectfully,   Curtis Armor   Sr Vice President / Director   Shamrock Bank, NA   Coalgate, Oklahoma","Curtis Armor, Sr. Vice President of Shamrock Bank, expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management principles, fearing they will eventually impact smaller community banks like theirs. Shamrock Bank, a $420 million institution in rural Oklahoma, is employee-owned and deeply integrated into its local community. Armor argues that the proposed regulations, initially aimed at large banks, will impose additional costs and burdens on small banks, reducing their ability to invest in local communities and employees. He highlights the bank's experience in managing climate-related risks and economic fluctuations, particularly in the energy sector, over the past decades. Armor warns that mandatory climate disclosure requirements could severely restrict operations in rural areas, making it difficult for small banks to survive. He urges the FDIC to consider the cost-benefit balance of the proposed rules, emphasizing that for small community banks, the costs may outweigh any potential benefits."

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the Senior Vice President and Risk Officer  of American Bank, a $700 million community bank located in Bozeman, Montana. We primarily provide  commercial construction and general commercial loans. I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the  future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community banks. Such application may  significantly impact our ability to remain competitive. Even if not directly applied to community banks,  such regulation may have the unintended consequences that, to remain competitive, community banks  may need to comply (similar to interchange income constraints for large banks that de facto require  smaller banks to adhere to in order to remain competitive). Specifically: - Costs associated with scenario  analysis; - Hiring qualified experts to perform scenario analysis; and - Gathering more data from  customers. Further, we already implement stress testing on our loan portfolio as part of CECL and  consider climate issues in our Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery program. Thank you for the  opportunity to submit comments on the proposed framework as well as currently limiting this proposal  to banks with more than $100 billion in assets. Please conduct outreach with community bankers to  better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.    Andrew R. Kostyal   Bozeman, MT     
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am the CEO of Barwick Banking Company, a  $230 million community bank located in Barwick, GA, with branch offices in St. Augustine and Ormond  Beach, FL. We primarily provide agricultural loans and are the only bank with a physical branch presence  in Barwick GA. Our other branches are one of only a handful of small community banks in their  respective markets.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial  risk management to community banks. This would adversely affect our institution in that compliance  with a climate-related financial risk management framework would be expensive and would  unnecessarily duplicate current risk management practices.  Unlike large banks, community banks do  not pose systemic risk to the financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all""  climate-related financial risk management framework designed for large, complex institutions.  I would  like to thank FDIC for the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed framework. I also thank the  FDIC for limiting its proposal to banks with more than $100 billion in assets and I encourage the FDIC to  conduct outreach with community bankers to better understand why this proposal should never apply  to community banks.

I am the President and CEO of  First Option Bank located in communities surrounding the Kansas City Metro in Kansas and Missouri.  Most of our banks are in communities of less than 6000 people. We are a $600 Million community bank  providing home loans, small business and commercial loans, consumer loans and agriculture loans. In  several of the communities we are the most active lender remaining with a full service bank. After  reading what you have proposed, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate- risk management to banks like ours, a small community bank. This proposed framework would  negatively impact my communities. Community Banks with any exposure to agriculture have always  been impacted by climate-related risks. We've always accounted for those issues. Community Banks do  not pose a systemic risk to the financial system and a 'one size fits all' framework that is designed for  large complex institutions that do not know their clients well, or who do not live in the areas where  climate impacts occur regularly, could seriously affect our institution and the communities we serve.  Dealing with the costs and complexity of compliance as it currently is, and add something of this  magnitude, and I feel the expense would be insurmountable and unnecessarily duplicate our current risk  management practices. Weather has always played a role in our current practices when assessing loan  loss provisions and credit management. Living in Kansas, severe weather has always played a part in our  daily lives. Bankers in Kansas have always rallied to support their communities when tornados or other  severe weather incidents occur. With the adoption of CECL, we're already assessing risks such as climate  with the booking of each loan. This proposed regulation would create additional response and costs to  what we're already doing. I personally thank you for limiting the proposal currently to banks over the  $100 billion in asset threshold and I strongly encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community  bankers to understand why this proposal should never trickle down to community banks.

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I appreciate the FDIC's concern about protecting the environment. The climate change issues have to be  addressed by everyone. There are so many better ways to help address climate change than adding  more regulatory burden on banks.  All industries and constituents must come together and find  common ground to combat climate change. Placing additional burdens on banks will only hurt the banks  that help keep our economy moving. The risk management practices that banks have in place to help  mitigate the impact of natural disasters have already existed for 20 plus years.  I hope that you and your  team will not apply additional regulatory burden on banks concerning climate change.    Thank You!    Bob Cerkovnik   Casper, WY   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing this letter in reference to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for  climate-related risk management for large financial institutions.  I am a 5th generation community  banker with my family founding BOM Bank in 1903 in Montgomery La. Since our humble beginnings in a  very poor, rural community of 800 people, our bank has been fortunate enough to grow to 17 locations  with over 700 million in total assets.  BOM Bank is a Certified Development Financial Institution (CDFI)  with 15 of our 17 locations located in Persistent Poverty Counties. We operate 15 locations in North and  Central La and 2 locations in Deep East Texas. We are proud to have broken ground on our 18th location  and this location will be in Pineville La in Rapides Parish, which is also a Persistent Poverty County.   Throughout the years of growth, we have never lost touch with who and what has made us the success  we are, that being the citizens of our communities.  I am very concerned that the FDIC will at some point  in the future impose the same climate-related policies on community banks. Over my 28 years at BOM  Bank, it always seems regulations that are imposed on the largest financial institutions invariably end up  being imposed on community banks at some point.  BOM Bank has been in business for 119 years and  during this time-period; we have not only survived but also thrived thru hurricanes, depressions,  recessions, Covid-19, bank-runs, mortgage meltdown and everything else that has happened over the  past century. We know how to underwrite loans and continue to help our communities thrive.  During  the Covid-19 Pandemic, BOM Bank participated in the Paycheck Protection Program and provided much  needed capital in the amount of approximately 165 million to approximately 2000 small businesses. We  provided loan deferrals, waived NSF fees, donated money to food banks, bought food for bank staff  bank-wide from local independently owned restaurants, partnered and volunteered hundreds of hours  with our local hospitals where Covid-19 shots were provided. These are just a small amount of what we  did during Covid-19 and shows that even during the worst pandemic in our nations history, we still  showed up to work, took care of our customers, non-customers and the community as a whole.  I hope  and pray the FDIC only imposes these climate-related risk management policies to banks with more than  100 billion in assets.  I thank you very much for your time and I apologize for the length of this letter.  However, I hope this letter shows I have a love & passion for my communities, customers and the  community banking industry.    With Kindest Regards,      Ken Hale President/CEO   BOM Bank  Ken Hale   Natchitoches, LA

We are an AG bank in Oklahoma and Texas. We  have total assets of 450 million and a large ag and agribusiness loan portfolio. My concern is this rule will  eventually affect ag banks of my size. Our bank was established in 1910. We have dealt with adverse  climate affects our whole existence. Just in my forty-year career we have experienced five severe  droughts, several floods and extreme heat. All of these events have had effects on the profitability of  our bank. The Ag banks that are still in business could teach the class on ""climate related financial risk""  mitigation. We don't need another rule to follow while we do our job of mitigating weather risk to our  bank. I would like to thank the FDIC for allowing community banks to comment on this new rule and not  applying it to community banks.   Sincerely,    Rick Holder   Chairman/CFO Cattlemens Bank

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. As an industry advocate and long time  community banker and shareholder, I see numerous flaws in the proposals related to the financial risks  related to certain industries purportedly creating undue damage to our climate. We all have a vested  interest in a clean and safe environment. And, we mostly agree that the climate is changing as it has  since the earth was formed. Where we deviate from each other is the impact mankind is making in the  climate, which is an argument for the public forum, not within the financial regulation of banking  institutions.  If the public majority feels certain industries should be restrained, then by majority rule,  legislation and regulations should be focused direct on the industries. Trying to curtail these industries  through financial regulation imparts more political will than public opinion.  Banks, especially  community banks, do a great job of factoring in all known risks when evaluating the merits of a  transaction. Property insurance, including extended coverages, are almost always required. And all  sources of repayment are stressed to include risks related to issues such as weather events. Bankers are  trained to manage and mitigate risks, including climate related, which is all under the safety and  soundness reviews. Adding additional regulation for climate related risks create additional layers of  burden and will mostly cause the small and under-served markets to suffer the greatest from a  restriction of credit access. These entities typically do not have the resources to prove climate related  issues (i.e. - carbon footprints, etc.) are addressed.  I encourage the FDIC as well as the other prudential  financial regulators, to reconsider the climate-related proposals. While currently targeted at the  institutions over $100 billion, as with most legislation, the trickle down (or waterfall) will engulf  community banks, causing continued consolidation and continued reduction to credit access for most  small businesses.  Thank you for your consideration of my thoughts.    Chip Lynch   Dallas, TX   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am addressing this short note that the statement of principles for climate-related risk management is  going to produce no tangible results, increased costs to the industry and worthless data with which will  not reduce carbon at all. Better money and time should be spent on overall approach to being a good  corporate citizen and also supporting the communities within our markets. The level of disclosure and  the resultant audit and litigation risks severely outweigh any threats.    Christopher Martin   Tinton Falls, NJ     
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. We do not fit into that category but are  concerned with the trickle-down effect of regulations. I am President of the $450 million asset Citizens  Bank of Clovis, Clovis, NM. We are located in East Central New Mexico in a rural farming and ranching  community of 38,000. We were chartered in 1916, which has allowed us to serve Clovis and the  surrounding area for 106 years. Our Bank survived the 1918 Flu epidemic, the Depreciation and Dust  Bowl era of the 30's, World War II, the S & L collapse of the 80's with runaway inflation and a National  Prime of 21%, the 2008 Real Estate collapse and the 2020-2022 Corvid Pandemic. Our loan portfolio at  March 31, 2022 consisted of 32% Ag with the balance primarily in Commercial loans. Our total capital  ratio stands at 18.71%, which is 10.71 % over that ratio for being considered ""Well Capitalized"". I do not  believe a separate risk-management framework for climate-related financial risk is necessary to manage  safety and soundness at my bank or any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets. Our  existing risk management practices are effective and have enabled us to serve our community for 106  years through many uncertain times as enumerated above. Unlike large banks, we do not pose systemic  risk to the financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related  financial risk management framework designed for large complex institutions. This framework would be  expensive to establish and would unnecessarily duplicate current risk management practices that have  served us well. Scenario analysis would be expensive to establish, would require specialized third-party  expertise, and should not be mandatory for community banks like ours. This scenario would require  analysis for transition risks by gathering climate data from our customers. I am not aware of any of our  customers who would be sophisticated enough to maintain this type of data. This analysis would require  my bank to forecast for remote and speculative risks that would be of little practical utility to the  regulator or us. Qualified experts that could perform this analysis are not located in our area. We  currently stress test our loan portfolio for financial risk as well as conduct independent audits and  independent loan reviews. We continually monitor our local economic conditions and take appropriate  actions as dictated. This has served us well for 106 years. Thank you for the opportunity to submit  comments on the proposed framework. I appreciate the proposal is only affecting banks of $100 billion  in assets, but I am concerned that community banks may be next. I would encourage you to conduct  outreach with community bankers to better understand why this proposal should never apply to  community banks.    Sincerely,    Kent Carruthers, President Citizens Bank of Clovis Clovis, NM 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comments on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am President and CEO of Claremont Savings  Bank, a $500 million mutual bank with offices in western New Hampshire and eastern Vermont.  I think  the efforts of the FDIC to focus on ""climate risk"" are inappropriate and beyond its mandate. It will  require banks to produce meaningless information that will provide no benefit to the bank or the  regulators. We already do a good job of considering risks to our borrowers and the institution.  It  appears that the goal is not to address risk management but to prod banks not to fund companies in  unfavored sectors. In the Northeast, we are dependent of fuel oil for heating most of our homes and gas  for heating and electricity. We are already having issues with energy prices as pipeline construction is  stalled and too much renewable energy is added to the grid. Continued increases in prices will hurt our  consumers, local businesses and the overall economy.  This seems to be a political campaign by the FDIC  and other federal entities and will be viewed as such by most of the regulated entities. If the  administration changes, there would be a reversal. It is not healthy for us to have what should be stable  risk management guidance whipsawed back and forth depending on the administration in power.  I  know this policy change is intended for the larger banks, but their risk is not climate risk. It is the risk of  falling out of favor with the regulators. We need those banks to support our energy sector, or we will all  suffer.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment. It is frustrating to see our regulators take political  positions.    Sincerely,    Reginald Greene   Claremont, NH   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large institutions. I have been with Commercial Bank, in St. Louis County,  Missouri for 25 years and a state bank examiner for 7 years prior. We are a community bank with about  $300 million in assets after 34 years of business. We offer consumer and business products to our areas  and the largest volume of our loans are to small business. These loans include lines of credit, equipment  lending and real estate loans for their businesses.  While climate change is real and a concern, the  proposed framework for managing climate-related financial risk management for large banks will  negatively impact my community. Not only costs to financial institutions, but also to businesses. We  already comply with environmental rules and regulations and the added measures seem to complicate  costs associated with becoming greener.  Our concern is that it will filter down to community banks and  as my 32 years has shown, it eventually gets put upon all banks. Currently, financial institutions already  deal with severe weather events in our risk management as well as our reserve for loan losses. We have  had testing and preparation for these events for years as well as many of our larger businesses and  unfortunately, we have also been thru them.  The proposal gets down to what scenarios are being  proposed and the analysis of each. The cost and time will be prohibited for a community bank as this  type of analysis is performed by Wall Street firms, not bankers who deal with the communities deposits.  We would need to hire and implement these will cause the vast majority of smaller to mid-size  institutions to sell, because we make money on the margin, not from brokerage/insurance/etc. and  there is only so much money we make.  Our customers are small and would not be able to gather the  information as they are not that sophisticated or staffed. So they would need people to comply and this  would force the same thought. They only make so much money and if they can't make money, they will  close their business.  While it sounds great and climate change should be addressed, the proposed risk  management is dangerous to small businesses, including banks, as the compliance costs will cause  several to exit. We serve those types of business by a large margin, not the big institutions, and if small  business are forced out, so our the small bank.  Please keep in mind, these proposals almost always hit  small institutions as some point.    Nathan Bartlett   Executive Vice President   Commercial Bank   Saint Louis, MO 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      To Whom it May Concern: I am writing today in response to the FDIC's request for comment regarding  its statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management. We feel that it is only a matter  of time before this proposed ruling that is designed for institutions over $100 billion in assets will trickle  down to smaller community banks. This letter is in response to the FDIC's request for comment on its  statement of principles.  Shamrock Bank is a $420 million community bank located in Oklahoma. We are  90% owned by our employees via an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. We have locations in very rural,  low-income areas in Oklahoma. We are very community minded and understand that the success of our  locations in these areas, as well as the community, are reliant on each other. There is very little  economic activity in these communities and if they lose the bank or their school, the community  effectively dies.  As in many cases, proposed rulings by agencies that are intended to affect only the  largest banks ends up as issues for small community banks like ours. The proposed framework for  managing climate risk will do nothing but add additional costs and burdens to our community bank,  leaving fewer resources to invest back into our communities and employees. Banks like ours, especially  in Oklahoma and Texas, have dealt with climate crisis for decades. Tornados, floods, ice storms and  wildfires have all been annual occurrences. We feel that our response to climate issues has been proven  over the last two decades.  Furthermore, we have also survived busts in the energy sector since the  1980s. Over the last 2 decades as oil prices have risen and fallen in drastic swings, we have become very  astute in evaluating direct and secondary exposure in our loan portfolio. We strongly feel that CECL will  also add an additional level of reserves to limit exposure.  Lastly, should the requirements for climate- disclosure requirements be pushed on banks like ours it will severely restrict how banks operate in rural  areas. What is already a strain to keep these banks open will become impossible as resources are used  for meaningless disclosures that serve no purpose for the bank, the climate or the communities we  serve.  We pray that you understand and evaluate the cost / benefit of this proposed rulemaking. In  many cases, with small community banks, there will be no benefit and the cost will be devastating to  banks and communities.    Respectfully,   Curtis Armor   Sr Vice President / Director   Shamrock Bank, NA   Coalgate, Oklahoma   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am submitting this letter to you at the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. As President & CEO, I lead and  represent a small community bank of $305 million in assets that is located in the Mississippi Delta. We  are the only bank that is chartered and domiciled in Cleveland, Mississippi (we're the hometown bank!).  We also serve the Grenada and Merigold, Mississippi markets and are the only bank with a branch in  Merigold. We are proud to serve in this quite rural area of America. Our focus is only on these  communities within Bolivar and Grenada counties. We gladly accept all size loan requests (no loan too  small) as well as prioritize the true investment needs of our local communities.  While I have read and  understand that this proposed regulation is targeting the largest of banks, it is my great concern and  fear that FDIC authorities and examiners will eventually bring this regulation down to the smallest of  banks such as ours. The affordability of additional manpower, additional technology tools and external  specialized consultants will only add to the growing expense of these areas just to support regulatory  rules and regulations. As these costs rise, the ability to remain competitive and independent comes into  question. Yet it is our greatest desire to be just that as it is so very clear that local community banks best  serve small and rural communities as evidenced most recently by our support of the Payroll Protection  Program (PPP). Our bank originated almost 800 loans for almost $24 million throughout the 2 years in  our local communities with great commitment and efficiency.  The point is that regularly adding  regulatory requirements and responsibilities reduces our competitiveness and potentially reduces our  ability to provide credit to the local citizens and small businesses. Rural America needs local community  banks, not minimized branches of large banks.  From an actual physical risks management perspective,  we are experienced and seasoned in business continuity and disaster recovery. We have managed well  and operated through the pandemic, ice storms (loss of utilities) and even experienced a tornado 6  weeks ago within 200 yards of our main office (loss of power and part of property) and yet we quickly  adapted and put into place our existing procedures; thus, the need for additional regulation for small  banks is not needed. Community bankers are quite often seasoned experts and well versed in how to  adapt quickly.  In conclusion, I thank you for the opportunity to submit my comments and share my  concerns on future unintended consequences and their impact on those banks that best serve rural  America.    Respectfully,    Daniel Whalen   Cleveland, MS 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am a board member for a community bank. I believe trying to gauge climate change risk is a fools  errand, and a waste of time and money. It will be perceived (correctly) as a way for leftists to deny  funding to political unpopular industries like Oil and Gas, Coal, Trucking, Agriculture, mining, Real Estate,  etc. It will be totally subjective, and therefore another thing to get sued or fined for. Hurting the banking  industry.  We operate in an Agricultural and Oil Producing region. This initiative is much more likely to  damage our economy than anything climate change does. We make almost no loans longer than 10yrs,  except for loans we sell to the FHLB for real -estate. I can't imagine any hyped scenario that presents a  risk to us in the next 10 yrs.    Thank you    Dave Rebol   Fort Morgan, CO   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing this letter regarding the FDIC's request for comment on climate related risk-management  for larger institutions.  I am the Executive Vice President/Chief Commercial Banking Officer for Peoples  Savings Bank of Rhineland. We are a $480 million dollar bank with eleven locations, with many located  in small rural communities.  The proposed framework for managing climate-related financial risk  management for large banks will negatively impact my community. As I work with our commercial  borrowers, many who are small businesses, it is apparent that increased regulatory burden and costs is  making it very difficult to maintain these businesses that are often vital within our small communities.   Thank you for the opportunity to let me express my comment on this proposal. Additionally, I strongly  encourage you to conduct an outreach to community bankers to fully understand the negative impact  this proposal will have on many of our small communities.    Sincerely.    Don P. Meyer   Fallon, MO     
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley: I am writing this letter in regard to the FDIC's request for comment on climate  related financial risk management. Farmers & Merchants Bank is a $260 million asset community bank  with five branches serving suburban and rural markets in Southwest Ohio. As President and CEO of our  community bank I appreciate your consideration of concerns with potential new rules that will  ultimately impact all FDIC regulated banks. While the current proposals are targeted at banks with over  $100 billion in total consolidated assets we all know that the same rules will either trickle down over  time or be applied to smaller institutions as ""best practices"".  Banks have always been, and always will  be, in the risk management business. While we do not specifically measure each and every type of risk,  but we do consider all risk factors before lending to our customers and helping them with their small  business and daily needs. While we have not historically used the term ""climate risk,"" it is specifically  considered and managed. We require our farmers to carry crop insurance that covers their crops from  catastrophic weather-related events. We require any building owner located in flood zone to carry flood  insurance. We talk with business owners about their internet technology, backups, and security if  applicable to the stability of their company. These are just a few obvious ways that for almost one  hundred years we have been around and able to manage and update as needed to mitigate potential  climate risk on a daily basis.  I can assure you that community banks do not pose systemic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management practices. We have always monitored our loans as a percentage of capital by types and  categories. This deliberate monitoring of concentration risk prohibits us from getting into any one  industry or type of lending too deep. We maintain less the 15% of capital to any one industry to  eliminate the risk of a catastrophic ending to any one industry. This helps manage all types of risk from  pandemic to climate risk, or just an overall failure in a certain industry due to supplies or changing times.   Having to conduct scenario analysis and additional modeling or monitoring would be yet another  regulatory burden to our institution. These proposals would create extra hours spent on each and every  loan in our portfolio that would likely also lead to the need for additional staff. There is no doubt that  these new proposals will not only be a time burden but also a significant cost burden. The time and staff  requirements would be a huge negative impact that would create a cost that would have to be passed  along to the consumers. In addition, these scenario analysis and future modeling generally end up  creating additional software expense to help try and effectively manage the process. Software always  has annual cost in addition to the larger one-time expense of purchasing and implementation.  In  summary, I strongly urge the FDIC considered what we are already doing to manage and mitigate  climate risk. Many banks have been around for over one hundred years and been very effective at  managing this risk without the ""help"" of these new proposals. This needs to be considered given the  limited resources available at small institutions and the great burden these reporting requirements  would create.  - Shon Myers, Miamisburg, OH 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:      I am submitting this letter in response to the FDIC request for comment on the Statement of principles  laid out in FIL-13-2022. This statement addresses climate related risks and risk management implication  for Large Financial Institutions. I am the President of a one billion dollar community bank in Marion  Iowa. We have been serving our community for over 95 years with a strong focus on agricultural and  loans within our community to both individuals and businesses. I would like to acknowledge the  consideration for limiting this proposal to institution with total assets over $100 billion. While this does  restrict the initial proposal I have significant concerns that these standards may be applied to  community banks and significantly impact our ability to provide products and services to our customers.  The increased assessment would lead to higher costs to customers, restrictions in product offerings to  customers and significant negative impact to the economy of the area. We as a bank have an in depth  knowledge and understanding of the risks both to our customers and our portfolio as do most  community banks. This proposal regardless of the level of application will have a negative impact on our  community and others. Thanks for allowing the opportunity to comment on the proposed framework  and I would encourage continued outreach and communication with banks at all levels but particularly  community banks as these proposals evolve.    Regards,   Gene Neighbor   President and CEO, Farmers State Bank    Farmers State Bank   1240 8th Ave  Marion, IA 52317     
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions.  My name is Terri Barrett. I am the Market  President of Financial Security Bank in Kerkhoven, MN, a $137 million community bank located in Swift  County, Minnesota. We primarily provide agriculture loans and are the only bank with a physical  presence in Kerkhoven, MN.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate related  financial risk management to community banks. I believe existing risk management practices are  effective and have enabled community banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. We recently  experienced a severe weather-related event. Due to the strength of the thunderstorms in our area, our  bank was without power for 48 hours. Our Disaster Recovery Plan was created for incidents just like this.  Our team was successful in following the plan and had services restored for our customers within a few  hours using generator power. We persevered through the outage with very little inconvenience and  impact to our customers and could have continued if necessary. We have served this community for 138  years and are committed to ensuring we have adequate disaster recovery plans in place. This  commitment was proven during our most recent weather-related event.  I am also concerned about the  costs associated with scenario analysis. Scenario analysis is complex and would require community  banks to hire specialized third-party consultants to perform the work. Not only would these specialists  be expensive, but it would be difficult to hire qualified experts if we were competing for services with  large banks. There are few, if any, individuals located in our community who are qualified to perform  this work. Community banks are generally small, relatively non-complex, and have lower risk profiles  compared to large banks. Requiring scenario analysis would be of little practical benefit to community  banks that are already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage these risks.  Thank you  for the opportunity to comment on the proposed framework. Also, thank you for limiting your proposal  to banks with more than $100 billion in assets. I encourage you to conduct outreach with community  bankers to better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.    Sincerely,    Terri Barrett   Market President   Financial Security Bank   Kerkhoven, Minnesota 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing this letter in response to proposals that have been circulating in regard to climate related  financial risk management requirements that would be imposed on the banking industry. At this time it's  my understanding that this would apply to larger banks but I am worried that it will trickle down to my  size institution in the near future.  I am President and CEO of a $120 million community bank located in  4 communities in Northwest Iowa. We deal with risk of weather on an almost daily basis and work that  into our risk management plans. At the state and local levels we face environmental regulations in every  project we do. These new proposals do not apply to community banks in rural America who are already  dealing with these matters.  Thank you for allowing me to comment on these proposals and I do thank  you for them applying to the banks over $100 billion right now. Please don't ever bring them to the  smaller size banks who are already doing their job in these fields. It seems regulations like to be imposed  on banks who act as law enforcement for these rules. This is a negative service for our customers who  will tend to resent them. We want to be positive in our service to customers and we can handle these  things easily as we do now with greater efficiency and effectiveness.    Sincerely,    Verlin (Gus) Barker   President/CEO   First Community Bank   Newell, IA 50568   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am sending this correspondence in response to the FDIC's request on its statement of principles of  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the Community President  of First Option Bank in Louisburg, KS, as well as on our Sr. Management Team that has banks in  communities surrounding the Kansas City Metro in Kansas and Missouri. Most of our banks are in  communities of less than 6000 people. We are a $600 Million community bank providing home loans,  small business and commercial loans, consumer loans and agriculture loans. In several of the  communities we are the most active lender remaining with a full service bank. After reading what you  have proposed, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-risk management to  banks like ours, a small community bank. This proposed framework would negatively impact my  communities. Community Banks with any exposure to agriculture have always been impacted by  climate-related risks. We've always accounted for those issues. Community Banks do not pose a  systemic risk to the financial system and a 'one size fits all' framework that is designed for large complex  institutions that do not know their clients well, or who do not live in the areas where climate impacts  occur regularly, could seriously affect our institution and the communities we serve. Dealing with the  costs and complexity of compliance as it currently is, and add something of this magnitude, and I feel  the expense would be insurmountable and unnecessarily duplicate our current risk management  practices. Weather has always played a role in our current practices when assessing loan loss provisions  and credit management. Living in Kansas, severe weather has always played a part in our daily lives.  Bankers in Kansas have always rallied to support their communities when tornados or other severe  weather incidents occur. With the adoption of CECL, we're already assessing risks such as climate, with  the booking of each loan. This proposed regulation would create additional response and costs to what  we're already doing. I personally thank you for limiting the proposal currently to banks over the $100  billion in asset threshold and I strongly encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community  bankers to understand why this proposal should never trickle down to community banks.

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing this letter in response to your request for comments on the statement of principles on  climate-related financial risk management framework.  I am President & CEO of Fowler State Bank,  Fowler, Indiana (""Bank""). We are a $250 million very rural institution that serves primarily the  agriculture industry. I am very concerned the FDIC will apply this framework to all financial institutions  at some point in the future, as all Regulation tends to trickle down from large, too big to fail institutions  to the small community banks serving communities coast to coast.  To manage a successful community  bank, numerous risks are considered in everyday operations and strategies are in place to mitigate those  risks. Serving the Agriculture industry, Fowler State Bank has been managing climate related risks for  decades as it can have a negative impact on grain producers.  Having the FDIC micro-manage each  particular risk is redundant and frankly insulting to the smaller well run financial institutions that serve  smaller communities across the country. This framework appears to be politically motivated and does  not serve the primary mission of the FDIC.  Thank you for allowing bankers to weigh in on this proposed  framework. I respectfully urge the FDIC to limit the proposal to the $100 billion, too big to fail,  institutions if it will not step away from the proposal altogether.    Most respectfully,    Steven K. Brunton   President & CEO   Fowler State Bank  Fowler, IN   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    As an independent community bank of $150 Million in a community of 5.500 people, I am genuinely  concerned with the already onerous regulations that are crushing small banks. The big banks do not care  as much about increased regulations because they have the resources to better manage the burden,  while small banks are squeezed out of existence. This leaves less competition for the big banks so they  can monopolize the market. Small community banks like Freedom Bank are the core to many small  towns and have a very positive impact on the health of their communities. The thought of adding  another unnecessary and ineffective regulatory burden related to climate change is absurd. The number  of community banks is on a steadily declining death march that is directly related to the crushing impact  of over regulation. In the past twenty years, the number of banks has been cut in half. In 2021, there  were 4,236 FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States. The number of such registered banks  has been declining since 2000, when there were over 8,300 FDIC-insured banks in the country. Please do  not put another nail in the coffin of community banks. I understand the proposal is initially intended for  banks over $100 Billion, but as we have seen repeatedly, those regulations eventually cascade down to  all banks. Enough is enough, please do not implement another meaningless, irrelevant, ineffective, and  burdensome regulation on the financial engine of small town USA!   Sincerely,    Donald Bennett   President of Freedom Bank   Columbia Falls, MT       
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of Bank ofGerman  American State Bank, a $310 million community bank located in Winnebago and Stephenson Counties,  IL. We primarily provide agricultural loans and are the only bank with a physical branch presence in  Pecatonica and German Valley, IL.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate- related financial risk management to community banks and that the proposed framework for managing  climate-related financial risk management for large banks will negatively impact my community.   Community banks have decades of experience managing concentration risks and are experts at knowing  when and how to reduce their loan concentrations during economic downturns and how to mitigate  risks. Community banks' longstanding and tried-and-tested underwriting and insurance practices  sufficiently address climate-related financial risks, as evidenced by the absence of community bank  failures following weather events.  Since the early 19th century, community banks have prepared for,  responded to, and survived myriad natural disasters, including catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes,  flooding, droughts, wildfires, and wind events. Community banks, as stewards of their local  communities, are best positioned to monitor the overall risk of their geographically limited loan  portfolios and investment practices and should not be subject to overly burdensome, duplicative, or  unnecessary regulations aimed at controlling climate-related financial risks posed by complex, global,  and systemically important institutions.  Subjecting community banks to any type of mandatory climate  risk regulation, scenario analysis, or enhanced climate-disclosure requirements is not only expensive and  unnecessary it will also cause many small businesses that operate within community bank footprints to  be ""choked off"" from the financial system.  Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the  proposed framework and for limiting the proposal to banks with more than $100 billion in assets. I  would encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to better understand why this  proposal should never apply to true community banks.    Warren Laube   Winnebago, IL   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      May 20, 2022      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am submitting this letter in response to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles  regarding climate-related financial risk management for large institutions. I am the CEO of Iowa Trust &  Savings Bank, a $425 million community bank with branches in Clive, Emmetsburg and Panora. Clive and  Panora are in the Des Moines, IA MSA. Emmetsburg is a rural community in north-central Iowa. We  primarily provide commercial real estate, agricultural and consumer real estate loans.  My concern is the  FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community banks. While  attending the ICBA Capital Summit in Washington DC earlier in May, Acting Chairman Gruenberg stated  during the FDIC presentation that climate-related financial risk management is for large institutions.  However, you understand my skepticism when similar statements have been made by regulatory  agencies in the past only to 'trickle down' to community banks and have 'one-size fit all'.  The following  is OCC Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu quote on March 7, 2022: ""This means that for midsize and  community banks, it will be a number of years before OCC examiners conduct climate risk management  examinations,"" Hsu said. ""My suggestion to those bankers has been simple: Use the time wisely. To the  extent that midsize and community banks can develop thoughtful, tailored assessments of their climate  risk profiles, they will help mitigate the risk of a 'trickle down' of large-bank climate risk management  expectations in the future.""  Iowa Trust & Savings Bank has been a lender to agri-businesses for 93  years. We understand better than most how to manage climate-related risk, and how climate effects the  livelihood of our farm customers and the success of Iowa Trust. To add additional climate-related  compliance requirements will likely duplicate existing practices and needlessly increase expenses. For  example, scenario analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise that would require community  banks to hire specialized third-party consultants to perform the work and potentially include forecasting  for remote and speculative risks. This would be of little practical utility to community banks that are  already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage these risks.  Currently, stress testing is  part of the transition to CECL. To expand this process to include gathering climate data from our  customers, and hiring qualified experts to perform scenario analysis, would provide little additional  value to determine the safety and soundness of Iowa Trust & Savings Bank.  Thank you for the  opportunity to submit comments on the proposed climate-related financial risk management.    Sincerely,   Kris M. Ausborn  CEO Iowa Trust & Savings Bank

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am the Senior Lending Officer of a $185MM  community bank located in SE MN. We are based in Preston, MN and are the only bank with a physical  location serving that city. We also have branches in Chatfield and Rochester, MN. Close to half our loan  volume is to farmers in rural areas in SE MN and we also serve small business in those areas and in  Rochester.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this proposed framework for  managing climate-related financial risk management for large banks to community banks which will  negatively impact the communities we serve.  I believe there should be separate risk policies for  community bank $100B or less. Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose systemic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management framework designed for large, complex institutions. Compliance under the proposed  regulations would be expensive (finding and hiring qualified people in this field) and unnecessary (as a  community and ag bank we are fully aware of how the environment is affected by our customers and  work with them to implement environmentally safe programs to their operations).  Thank you for the  opportunity to submit comments on the proposed framework and for limiting its proposal to banks with  more than $100 billion in assets. I encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to  better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am the Chief Risk Officer at Heartland Bank, a $1.5 billion community bank headquartered in Whitehall,  Ohio, and I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions.  Heartland bank exemplifies  the true meaning of a community bank. Our commercial lending focuses on our communities, lending  within niche markets, and helping start-ups get off the ground. We understand that when we lend to  businesses in our communities it strengthens our neighborhoods, provides jobs, revitalizes the  economy, and results in money going back into those same neighborhoods allowing them to prosper. I  am concerned that the proposed framework for managing climate-related financial risk management for  large banks will negatively impact the communities we serve.  As a community bank, we have a long  history of managing risk, including concentration risk and natural disasters, within our lending and  investment portfolios. Additional regulation is unnecessary for us to manage our climate related  financial risk. Our bank has long-standing and prudent underwriting and insurance practices that  sufficiently address climate risk and should not be overly burdened with duplicative and unnecessary  regulation that is aimed at larger and more complex institutions. Unlike large banks, we are not a  systemic risk to the financial system and should not be subjected to a one size fits all climate related risk  management framework. On January 1, 2023, we will be adopting CECL and will already be more  concerned about reflecting future risks, including climate related risk, in our loan loss reserve.  In  addition to the burden a required climate risk management framework would cause for community  banks is the concern related to the cost of such requirements like scenario analysis. Scenario analysis is a  complex process for which we would have to find a third-party consultant to perform, and which will  provide little value for the cost of a consultant as we are already familiar with our concentration risks. It  would also be difficult to gather climate data from our customers, and we are already stress testing our  loan portfolio.  Community banks have long been managing risks across the institution, including climate  related risks. We do not need the burden of additional regulation to interfere with the value we provide  our communities. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the statement of principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions.    Jennifer Eckert   Johnstown, OH   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    The FDIC is proposing that large financial institutions, defined as those with over $100 billion in total  consolidated assets, be subject to a climate-related financial risk management framework. To manage  climate-related financial risks, the FDIC has proposed a framework that would require large banks to  ensure climate-related financial risks are addressed in the bank's (1) governance; (2) policies, procedures  and limits; (3) risk management; and (4) data, risk measurement, and reporting. Additionally, the FDIC  would require large banks to address climate-related financial risk in the following risk areas: (1) credit  risk; (2) liquidity risk; (3) interest rate risk; (4) operational risk; (5) strategic planning; (6) reputational  risk; (7) liability or litigation risk.  I truly believe these steps are an overreach and are not necessary to  manage the safety and soundness of my community bank. In support of this belief I offer the following  reasons. * Existing risk management practices have been proven effective and have enabled community  banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. * Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose  systemic risk to the financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate- related financial risk management framework designed for large, complex institutions. * Compliance  with a climate-related financial risk management framework would be expensive and unnecessarily  duplicates current risk management practices.  The banking industry by its nature is involved in  assessing all types of risks and taking steps to mitigate and monitor risks. These are already incorporated  into our multitude of risk assessments and action plans. For example we monitor severe weather events  and have well established plans to execute. Example is past years of tornado activity in our area of  Missouri. How we have monitored economic factors for our loans which includes climate impact of  drought or too much rain, or hail events in our agriculture sector. Further our assessment of our reserve  for loan loss account we do review all these factors and run projections on potential impact to the loan  portfolio. Therefore, many of these factors sought to be addressed are already being done as normal  practice for banking and community banks in particular. The approach of scenario analysis is an  expensive exercise that requires specialized third-party expertise, and it should not be mandatory for  community banks, given the small size, relative non-complexity and lower risk profile of community  banks as compared to large banks. Finally, as part of the proposal it would require financial institutions  climate data from our customers. This will be extremely challenging and difficult for the customers of  community banks. Many of these customers will not have this information and will refuse to provide  such information. Will this lead us to point where banks will not be allowed to provide services to this  customer base and serve our mostly rural markets and communities? That is a strong and hopefully  unintended consequence of taking such steps and actions.    John Denkler   Farmington, MO 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I'm responding as a Director of a community bank, First Option Bank with locations in several small  communities in eastern/northern Kansas. Born on a farm, University degree with major in Agriculture  Education, operated a dairy farm, managed farms for Urban folks, kept grain storage records for local  elevator when gov't was paying farmers to reduce production - - I think the gov't finally got it right when  USDA went to offering crop insurance that can protect both production and price - - farmers can buy this  insurance, gov't stands behind extremes caused by weather or market conditions - - Employed by  University of Missouri as a County Extension Director; then hired as a banker in 1964 to over-see lending  to farmers and agri-businesses - - in 1971 I joined a bank holding company as the contact person for  banks being added to the company in rural markets - - in 1982 after 4 years managing a suburban bank I  rejoined Commerce Bancshares to over-see the problem agricultural loans as we dealt with weather,  prices and 21% Prime interest rates - - Agricultural lenders to grain production farmers need to  encourage their borrowers to use the crop insurance program - - I realize there are other facets to  agriculture than crop production, but this is where weather is most prominent. Don't know that  additional regulations or requirements are necessary as tools are already at hand to support both  Customers and Lenders.   K.  Konrad Heid   Santa Rosa Beach, FL   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      To Whom It May Concern:    With regards to the FDIC request for comment on it's Statement of Principles for Climate Related  Financial Risk Management, I submit the following.  I am President and Chief Executive Officer of St Clair  county State Bank of Osceola, MO, a $180M bank serving St Clair County State Bank and the surrounding  areas. Our main banking facility is located in Osceola, however, we have branch locations in Lowry City,  MO and Appleton City, MO as well. All locations are located in rural communities with focus being on  residential, agricultural, and commercial markets conducive to this area.  Should the FDIC apply Climate  Related Financial Risk Management to rural community banks such as this one, the impact to simply  comply with these requirements would be oppressive at best. Not only would this impact be felt by our  employees, but by the communities to whom we offer customer service. Our customers are our friends,  neighbors and acquaintances, and our time is as much as service as the banking products we offer.   Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on behalf of this community bank, as well as other  community banks with similar struggles to meet regulation requirements. I encourage you to continue  to reach out to community banks for input and the possible effects this would impose.   Sincerely,  Kirk Sibley   President   Osceola, MO   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am the Compliance Officer at Peoples Bank of East TN, a small community bank located in  Madisonville, TN. I am submitting this letter in response to the FDIC's request for comment on the  statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management.  While I understand the climate- related financial risk management framework is targeted at institutions over $100 billion in assets, I'm  writing to voice my concerns about the impact of these principles, I fear that they will ultimately trickle  down to community banks.  Community banks like us are not threatened by climate-related financial  risks, we apply risk management practices to manage risks, and we are experienced at serving our local  community to help prepare for and recover from severe weather events.  I do appreciate the chance to  submit comments, community banks are different and I feel that it's important to protect that role we  play to the local residence and businesses that we serve. I anticipate other community banks will reach  out and share their thoughts and concerns as well. Hopefully this outreach with community bankers will  help the FDIC and all regulatory entities understand why this proposal should never apply to community  banks.  Lari Scheu   Madisonville, TN     
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    The reason I am writing is regarding the FDIC's Request for Comment on its state of principles for  climate-related financial risk for Large Financial Institutions. I am the Chief Credit Officer of Legence  Bank, a $650million asset bank headquartered in Eldorado IL. We serve 12 communities in Southern  Illinois and 1 in Evansville Indiana. As a community bank, we are focused on ensuring the needs of the  areas we are in are met. We are also in a heavily agricultural area.  Everything I have read and heard, the  proposed regulatory changes are targeted on banks with assets exceeding $100billion. But, I have also  been advise the FDIC is focused on climate change as a ""systemic issue in the banking industry"". My first  comment is this: additional regulatory scrutiny in the industry will put an undue burden on community  banks. We are faced with enough challenges to just find adequate loans with sufficient credit quality to  lend to in this rising rate environment. Additionally the ""costs for compliance"" today are becoming  exorbitant. Measuring the potential impacts of climate change on a community bank and its customers  goes well beyond the abilities and capabilities of community bankers. For the past 50 years the  ""experts"" have been predicting and analyzing climate change with the question of ""to what avail""? The  predictions these experts made have failed to come to fruition as predicted. How, then, are bankers able  to assess changes? We do not employ meteorologists on our staff, nor can we afford to. We need to  focus our efforts on what we do every day: serve the needs of our communities and our customers in  them.  Personally, I think the effort to have any bank, regardless of size, to measure this climate-related  impact goes too far. But for banks that are MUCH smaller it poses an undue hardship. I look at Legence  Bank for a moment. We have a large agriculture portfolio. We work with customers across several  counties. We bank large operations that farm 6,000 acres and some that farm 600. We discuss crop  insurance coverage; we analyze secondary repayment sources; we make sure we have hazard insurance  in place on structures (and we have purchased blanket insurance for smaller loans); we know our  customers. Our lenders attend seminars and learn from experts on not only the local agriculture  economy, but national and international. We understand that weather patterns change. Some years are  normal; some are dry; some are wet. We discuss marketing opportunities with our farm customers. We  are diverse too. We don't lend internationally. We work with our farm customers to utilize FSA guaranty  programs as appropriate to mitigate risks. In short, we do not pose a risk to the Banking industry. We  are family-owned for the majority. We are seeking to be a part of our communities for the long-haul.  However, forcing added burdens only seeks to lessen that option.  I implore the FDIC to reconsider its  efforts and, if this change must be implemented, wholly exempt banks that are like us.      Mr. Alan Jones   Evansville, IN 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. I realize this is an important topic for the  agency and I appreciate the opportunity to provide commentary on our bank's position.  I serve as  President and Chief Operating Officer of Legends Bank, headquartered in Clarksville, TN. We are a $780  million Community Bank founded in 1998, currently serving Montgomery, Cheatham and Davidson  Counties. We are home to Fort Campbell and the renowned 101st Airborne Division. Our bank serves  the needs of small businesses and home builders in our community. As the only locally owned institution  in Montgomery County, we are very involved in the community and a close relationship with our local  government.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk  management to community banks such as ours. While I can certainly understand the agency's reasoning  for engaging with the country's largest banks, Legends Bank serves a very close knit geographic market.  We are intimately familiar with our borrowers and the risks they encounter. In our 24 year history, we  have survived an F-5 tornado that tore through our downtown in January of 1999 and a historic flood  that affected both Clarksville and Nashville in 2010. Our Bank was able to affectively navigate these  natural disasters without undue risks to our balance sheet. The local nature of our business model is  what protects us.  Compliance with a climate-related financial risk management framework would be  expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate current risk management practices. Our Bank currently  performs a robust quarterly analysis of our commercial real estate portfolio including stress testing for  individual loans plus portfolio segments. I would respectfully submit that Community Banks should be  excluded from such requirements now and in the future.    Sincerely,    Thomas Bates   Clarksville, TN   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:  I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles  for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions, I am the Compliance Officer  of Central State Bank, a $500 million community bank located in Calera, AL.  I am concerned that the  FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community banks -  which would negatively impact my Bank and its ability to service its customers. In my opinion -  Community Bankers already do a great job of maintaining safety and soundness by proper underwriting  of loans. Additional Regulatory burden on Banks of our size would do nothing but absorb already limited  resources that should be focused on serving our customers.  I would like to thank the FDIC for the  opportunity to submit comments on the proposed framework as well as limiting the proposal to banks  with more than $100 billion in assets. I encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community  bankers to better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.    Matt Meynardie  Calera, AL   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing this comment letter regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles  for climate-related financial risk management for large institutions. New Market Bank is a small  community bank with assets of approximately $190MM (prior to the pandemic we were only  approximately $125MM in assets). We have three locations in Elko New Market, Lakeville and Prior Lake  which are suburbs of the southern Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN metro area. We have 40 people on our  team in total which includes everyone from tellers at all our locations to me who is CEO, President and  CFO of our small organization. Most of the loans we make are to small businesses that help to either  finance larger purchases such as buildings or equipment to smaller operating lines of credit. We also  have a 2nd market mortgage department which consists of 7 of those 40 team members.  The main  reason that I am submitting a comment letter is because I am concerned the FDIC may in the future  apply this climate-related financial risk management framework to community banks. Community banks  do not pose a systemic risk to the financial system and already work hard to implement risk  management practices that are effective to managing the safety and soundness of our institutions.  These risk management practices already have considerations for potential climate-related risks woven  into the program. For example, the recent adoption of CECL requires banks to have a forward-looking  approach to risks on the economy through use of qualitative factors. Along with CECL, community banks  also have implemented stress testing on their loan portfolio to understand how various stress levels  would affect the level of reserves the bank would need to survive.  The most concerning part of the  proposal however is the scenario analysis exercise. The idea that a community bank may have to  eventually complete a scenario analysis that explores the impacts of climate-related risk on our strategy  and business model as well as identify and measure vulnerability to relevant climate-related risk factors  including physical and transition risk is overwhelming to say the least. This analysis would no doubt force  us to hire a 3rd party as we would not have the expertise on our team to complete the exercise  internally. It appears that in order to complete such a scenario analysis, we would also need to gather  climate data from our customers which could be nearly impossible as small businesses do not maintain  this data and would also have an objection to starting to collect it and then having to disclose it to us.  Finally, the results of the analysis would most likely not have any practical use for us as the likelihood of  these climate-related risks are remote and the impact is minimal. This exercise would just place another  expense burden on community banks which in turn decreases earnings and makes it harder to compete  against other larger financial institutions.  In conclusion, I sincerely hope the information provided in this  comment letter helps you to understand the challenges smaller community banks would face in  complying with a climate-related risk management program. The cost of implementing such a program  would be significant to a smaller institution with no real identifiable benefit. I appreciate the 
opportunity to share my comments and concerns. If there is any additional information that I could  provide that would help you understand the impact this potential rule could have on a community bank,  I am happy to be a resource.    Thank you,    Anita Drentlaw  CEO/President/CFO   Prior Lake, MN   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing to you regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of North  Central Bank, a $150 million dollar community bank with corporate headquarters located in Hennepin,  IL. We have two locations (Hennepin and Ladd) and they are both in very rural settings in communities  with populations of less than 1,200 residents each. We primarily provide agricultural loans and  residential real estate loans. We are the only banks within our communities with a physical location. At  this time, I am very concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk  management to community banks. I further fear that this type of risk-management could negatively  impact my communities and apply additional undue burden on our small bank. I believe that a separate  risk-management framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to manage safety and  soundness at our bank or any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets.  Our bank has  serviced the local communities for over 75 years and the existing risk management practices are  effective and have enabled us and other community banks to manage climate-related risk for decades.  Unlike large banks, small community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system and should  not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk management framework that is  designed for institutions that are large and complex. In our rural community bank setting, we have  managed to retain extremely talented employees that adequately manage our risk profile. Compliance  with a climate-related financial risk management framework would be expensive and would  unnecessarily duplicate many of our current risk management practices.  We believe that climate- related financial risks do not threaten the safety and soundness of our community bank. We have two  locations, over 18 miles apart, utilizing different communication/data systems, along with having our  entire network on the cloud. All of our senior management, lenders and operations staff are able to  work from home and VPN into our secure system should a climate-related disaster/event occur.  Numerous table-top testing events are held throughout the year and many weather related events are  considered. We have identified locations that can be utilized should our community bank need to be  temporarily closed for repair, thus allowing us to service all of our customers in a timely and safe  environment. Also, with the adoption of CECL, we will continue to take into account all future risks, such  as the risk that the climate will change and adjustments to our risk factors and loan loss reserves will be  continually reviewed/updated.  Additionally, any scenario analysis for a small community bank, like  mine, would be an expensive exercise that would require specialized third-party expertise. The scenario  analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise that would require a community bank to forecast  for remote and speculative risks and provide little to no practical utility to community banks that are  already familiar with their concentration risks and how to appropriately manage them.  In conclusion, I 
would like to thank you for your time and the FDIC for the opportunity to submit comments on the  proposed framework. I would like to also thank the FDIC for limiting its proposal to banks with more  than $100 billion in assets and continue to encourage the FDIC to conduct additional outreach to  community bankers to better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    My name is Randy Whitehead, President and CEO of PeoplesTrust Bank in HamiIton, Alabama. I am  writing to provide comments regarding the FDIC's statement of principles for climate-related financial  risk management for large financial institutions. I suspect that should these proposed requirements be  placed upon larger institutions it will only be a matter of time before smaller institutions will have  similar requirements.  I submit to you that the risk of ever-increasing regulation and the related  expense, creates a much greater risk to rural community banks than does climate change risk. As you  know the tremendous expense involved in complying with this regulation would be a huge burden on  small community banks. The banks which are the financial lifeblood of rural towns and communities are  either being consolidated into larger institutions or are closing branches in small towns partially due to  the ever-increasing cost of regulation, leaving the people of these communities with the only option of  driving many miles to participate in the banking system.  Our small City of Hamilton, Alabama has a  branch of a major nationwide banking institution. While that institution is pleased to operate here and  offer a myriad of checking accounts which provide that institution with low-cost deposits to be utilized  around the country, local individuals and small businesses find it difficult to obtain loans at that  institution. My point, obviously, is that without small, local community banks, people in rural  communities are going to be greatly harmed and unable to participate in the financial system.  Climate  change is ultimately ""weather"" which fluctuates and cycles over time within a fairly narrow range. As  high school students in the 1970's we observed that the climate scientists of the time were predicting  that the earth was entering into the next ""ice age"". How wise would it have been to commit millions and  billions of dollars over the course of the past 50 years preparing for the risk associated with another ice  age?  We operate a branch in Hackleburg, Alabama, a small town that was almost totally destroyed in  the tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011. We were able to work with our customers in the aftermath of  that disaster and in the years since the tornado the town has become better and stronger. Having  witnessed the devastation personally, I can attest that no amount of risk management would have  reduced the damage done by the F-5 tornado that day. In addition, many of our customers, operated  heavy equipment (fueled by diesel and gasoline) to clear the debris from the destruction and help  residents get on with their lives.  While I am pleased that this proposal is currently limited to banks of  $100 billion or more in total assets, I also know that many times, limited application regulations are  ultimately applied to all banking institutions. I respectfully request that the FDIC refrain from  implementing climate related risk management requirements that will ultimately do serious financial  damage to the residents of the rural communities we serve.    Sincerely,

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    PriorityOne Bank is a CDFI certified Community Bank with just over $900 million in assets,  headquartered in Magee, Mississippi, primarily serving the needs of small communities along the  Highway 49 corridor with branches as far south as Hattiesburg, MS and as far north as Ridgeland,  Mississippi. PriorityOne Bank submits this letter to the FDIC in response to the FDIC's request for  comments on its statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial  institutions. Specifically, PriorityOne Bank is concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this  climate-related financial risk management to community banks, which is unnecessary to manage safety  and soundness at any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets.  The primary concerns  affecting PriorityOne Bank are the FDIC's proposed framework that would require large banks to address  climate-related financial risk in its credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, strategic  planning, reputational risk and liability or litigation risk along with the requirement to perform scenario  analysis.  A separate risk management framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to  manage the safety and soundness at a Bank with just over $900 million in assets. The Bank's current  existing risk management practices are effective and have enabled community banks to manage  climate-related risk for decades. Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose systematic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management framework designed for large, complex institutions. Compliance with a climate-related  financial risk management framework would be expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate current  risk management practices the Bank already has is place through Disaster Recovery, which was shown to  be effective through past climate events such as Hurricane Katrina or various disastrous tornadoes the  Bank has faced through the years. With regard to financial stress caused by transition risk, the Bank's  Disaster Recovery plan saw it through COVID and its aftermath, again stressing the unnecessary burden  of duplicate risk management.  Further, with the adoption of CECL, PriorityOne Bank will need to be  even more concerned about reflecting future risks, such as the risk that the climate will change, in loan  loss reserves. The costs of the proposal, especially regarding scenario analysis will be unnecessarily  burdensome.  Mandated scenario analysis is problematic as it is an expensive exercise that requires  specialized third-party expertise, and it should not be mandatory for community banks, given the small  size, relative non-complexity and lower risk profile of community banks as compared to large banks.  PriorityOne Bank already implements stress testing its loan portfolio as part of transitioning to CECL  which eliminates the need for performing scenario analysis. Further, in order to conduct scenario  analysis for transition risks, community banks would need to gather climate data (such as greenhouse  gas emissions data) from their customers, many of which do not maintain this data and would object to  gathering and disclosing this data, which is overly burdensome Further, scenario analysis would require 
community banks to forecast for remote and speculative risks and be of little practical utility to  community banks that are already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage these risk.  The Bank would face many difficulties in hiring qualified experts to perform scenario analysis,  particularly if forced to compete with large banks to secure these services, as there are few individuals  located in PriorityOne Bank's community who are currently qualified to perform this work.  In  summation, the proposed Climate-Related Financial Risk Management Framework and the  implementation of scenario analysis to explore the impact of climate-related risk on PriorityOne Bank's  strategy and business model to identity and measure vulnerability to relevant climate related risk factors  including physical and transition risks, is unnecessarily burdensome for an institution with just over $900  million in assets.  PriorityOne Bank thanks the FDIC for the opportunity to submit comments on the  proposed framework and further thanks the FDIC for limiting its proposal to banks with more than $100  billion in assets and would encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community Bankers to better  understand why this proposal should not apply to community banks. Thank you for your time and  consideration.    Sincerely,    Robert J. Barnes   President & CEO  PriorityOne Bank   Magee, MS   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    My name is Sarah Getzlaff. I am the CEO of Security First Bank of North Dakota, a $240 million  community bank in central North Dakota. I am a 3rd generation community banker following in the  footsteps of my father and grandfather. I grew up watching my dad support our community by donating  his time to economic development boards, making financial donations to community causes and by  meeting with customers whenever and wherever they needed him. I clearly remember him leaving our  house late one night to lend a customer cash out of his own wallet for a medical emergency after the  customer called in a panic. Stories like this were a constant part of my childhood and a tradition I am  honored to continue. Stories like this happen daily at community banks across the nation. Stories like  this need to continue, as they help small communities survive.  Security First Bank has five locations in  North Dakota, mostly in rural areas, and is very representative of a typical community bank. We opened  our doors in 1925. For the first seventy-five years, we operated solely in three communities with less  than 1,000 residents each, all of which have been faced with shrinking populations and struggling Main  Streets. In the early 2000's, we opened two additional locations in ""big cities,"" which have a combined  population of less than 100,000 residents.  I am writing to you today, as a community banker, regarding  the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related financial risk  management for large financial institutions. While my family's bank is clearly not a large financial  institution, I am incredibly concerned that the requirement for climate-related financial risk  management will trickle down to community banks like mine. Recent statements made by the FDIC that  ""all financial institutions should prepare for how you will manage climate related activities in the future""  have only intensified my concern.  Community banks like mine are incredibly important in small  communities; yet they are continuously being gobbled up by larger banks as regulations snuff out their  ability to remain independent. While I understand the need for regulation and the reason for many of  our existing regulations, I also believe that community banks are vastly different than large banks and  need to be regulated with significant regard given to these differences. I further believe the benefits of  regulations need to outweigh their costs - both financial and non - and that these benefits and costs will  be much different in a community bank than in a large bank.  The ""scenario analysis"" in the FDIC's  proposal would require specialized third-party expertise, something we will have to seek out and pay for  and then try to interpret, test and apply to our portfolios. While the cost of this service, along with  training our staff and possibly needing to hire additional staff to help with the regulatory burden, is  unknown, I do know that these costs will drive up the borrowing costs for small businesses and farmers.  Further, the customers we serve will not have the resources to gather meaningful climate-related  information for us to use. Now, if there was a measurable benefit to this additional regulation, it's  possible the costs could be justified. The truth is - there is no additional benefit from or need for this 
additional regulation. Community banks like mine have a long history of evaluating the risk of our  balance sheets and already have mechanisms in place with existing regulatory frameworks to monitor  and manage portfolio related risks. Further, our community bank does not pose a systemic risk to the  financial system like the ""too big to fail"" banks.  I am very concerned this added regulation could  ultimately choke off credit to legal and creditworthy borrowers and also cause more small community  banks like mine to sell off, further consolidating the industry. I am respectfully requesting the FDIC  refrain from implementing any climate related risk management framework at the community bank  level. Our family's bank has been a huge supporter of local farms and businesses and they have  supported us in return. We need this legacy to continue - not just for my families sake, but because in  small communities, we all know if we support one another, there is a greater chance our communities  will survive, our businesses will thrive and our schools will remain open and independent.    Sincerely,    Sarah M. Getzlaff  CEO Mandan, ND     
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am submitting this letter in response to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles  for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions.  Shelby County State Bank  has served the communities of Shelby County in the heart of Illinois for over 125 years. This county is  considered a rural, underserved area. In fact, we are only one of three banking facilities in Shelbyville  and The Only banking facility in two of the five small towns where our branches are located. We  primarily provide agricultural loans, but also supply funds for consumers, small businesses, and  homeowners from the local deposits we are entrusted with.  As CFO and Compliance Officer, I am  concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to  community banks. Existing risk management practices are effective and have enabled our community  bank to manage climate-related risk for decades. Compliance with climate-related financial risk  management would be expensive and unnecessarily duplicate current risk management practices  involved with our business continuity initiatives. As evidenced by our bank's outstanding safety and  soundness examination results, we proactively plan for physical and financial climate-related risks to our  bank and to the individuals that we serve.  As a community bank, we are focused on the individual. We  do not lump all customers together as a faceless group with a one-size fits all mentality. Because of our  small size, we can work side-by-side and provide individualized attention to a customer's specific needs.  Regulatory overkill takes valuable staff resources away from the time we require to focus on serving the  individual.  Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed framework and for  originally limiting the proposal to banks with more than $100 billion in assets. Any outreach by the FDIC  to better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks will be welcome.    Sincerely,    Jodie M. Ogle   Chief Financial & Compliance Officer   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    We are a 100 million dollar mutual Community Bank located in Philadelphia that has been dealing with a  whole gamut of risks for over 100 years. The bank is and has been in the risk business for many years  and does not need any more guidance (compliance overhead) in this area. Ever time more guidance is  placed on banks our size it just furthers the decline of the community bank at the cost of inner city  neighborhoods. My concern is that once this risk framework is placed on large banks it filters down to  banks our size.    Sidney Smith  Philadelphia, PA

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am the CEO of Somerset Savings Bank in  Bound Brook, NJ, a $680 million mutual bank with 7 branch locations. We are primarily a 1-4 family  home mortgage lender.  I am very concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related  financial risk management to community banks.    William Taylor   Bound Brook, NJ   
Mr. James P. Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention: Comments—RIN 3064-ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I represent Springs Valley Bank & Trust Company, a six-location, 110 FTE, $508M community bank  located in rural Southwest Indiana. We are a state-chartered commercial bank, and our primary Federal  Regulator is the FDIC. Our business model is built around rural county seat markets as that is where we  compete the best and can be most impactful. Our $395M loan portfolio is approximately 24%  agriculture, 50% small business, and 26% consumer household. While we fully understand that the  current statement of principles would not apply to Springs Valley Bank & Trust, we are commenting  because the FDIC has indicated this is the first iteration of guidelines that may ultimately apply to all  FDIC insured banks. We appreciate the opportunity to make our voice heard by providing relevant  comments.    For your context, we are deeply committed to prudent small business lending and meeting the credit  and other banking needs in our generally small, rural communities. We have several concerns about the  proposed rule that could negatively impact our bank and the communities we serve. We do a  considerable amount of small business and agricultural lending to include business acquisition,  operating lines of credit, equipment financing, and long-term real estate mortgages. In an average year,  Springs Valley generates 300-400 small business loans (using the CRA definition of $1M or less GAR).    - In 2019 we originated 369 commercial loans with average gross revenue of $1,559,779.  - In 2020 we originated 825 commercial loans with average gross revenue of $1,579,074.  - In 2021 we originated 838 commercial loans with average gross revenue of $1,394,037.    In 2020 and 2021, we generated $21,738,003 (414) of PPP loans in Round 1 and $12,271,906 (408) of  PPP loans in Round 2. While PPP loans generated in 2020 and 2021 certainly drove up originations in  aggregate to about double the norm, GAR exceeded $1M on average in each of the three years and  remained remarkably consistent in the $1.5M range.    We believe that climate-related financial risk is already incorporated into our strategic and risk  management framework. We base our business decisions on current and historical market data, which  provides information on the risk of a transaction. Accordingly, climate related financial risks are  inherently embedded into the risk identification and management process.   
Springs Valley Bank manages and maintains over 50 policies bank-wide. We conduct over a half-dozen  additional annual risk assessments and plans. Many of these policies have climate-related components  (e.g. our Lending Policy addresses monitoring loan concentrations, requiring flood insurance, monitoring  fire and windstorm insurance coverage, conducting environmental assessments, etc.).    Given our location in the heart of the Midwest, more specifically within the Ohio River Valley between  St. Louis and Cincinnati, we are particularly susceptible to high humidity and near triple-digit summer  temperatures. Those conditions can result in tornadoes, seasonal flooding, occasional hailstorms, and  accompanying wind damage to crops, homes, and other structures. All geographies across this country  have unique properties and characteristics that may present localized challenges as out-of-state  examiners attempt to quantify and provide meaningful oversight for climate-related risks.    The SEC climate disclosure takes the climate-risk conversation in an entirely more troubling direction.  Centered around the concept of “financed emissions,” largely defined as calculating and reducing  carbon emissions across a bank’s loan portfolio, this extreme approach would have negative far- reaching borrower impact and pit some industry-specific investor economic interests against those of  climate advocates. Commercial borrowers would be required to create elaborate estimates of up and  downstream emissions. They would incur significant costs, hiring accredited experts to produce the  required reports and disclosures. Financial reporting standards would require low materiality footnotes.  FIs would likely play a record keeping role and run the risk of being put in an untenable role between  regulators and borrowers.    In response to all this attention being directed to climate concerns, we would make the case for flexible  supervisory expectations, allowing for significant modification as events occur, as the practice of climate  risk identification develops, and the risks become more clearly defined. Regulation based on  assumptions and data behind today’s definitions and understanding of climate related financial risk  would be premature. A high-level approach that allows banks to assess their risk based on unique  circumstances would seem the most prudent. We would be proponents of safe harbor provisions and a  generous time-frame implementation for all size banks, but in particular for mid-sized and small FIs,  should climate-related risk measures currently being crafted for large FIs trickle down to smaller.    We appreciate the FDIC’s recognition that these principles would impose significant burdens if applied  to smaller banks. If the FDIC ultimately determines that climate-related guidance is necessary for all  FDIC insured banks, the guidance should not be extended to mid-sized and smaller FIs until climate risk  is better quantified and understood and should be tailored to avoid unnecessary operational burdens. If  that day does arrive, we would be proponents of safe harbor considerations and a generous time frame  implementation period.    FIs are critical economic engines of commerce across the United States and provide households,  companies, or communities the necessary financing to thrive. It is important that the FDIC be cognizant  of and take adequate actions to avoid, the unintended consequences of economic disruption. We would  strongly caution prudential regulators against imposing overly prescriptive regulatory requirements on 
climate-related risks. Doing so at this time, particularly with respect to transition risks, could shape bank  business decisions for reasons of acquiescence, rather than out of pure safety and soundness concerns.  Banks and banking services are as a rule, sparser in our markets in rural Southern Indiana. There are  already many very small rural communities that have suffered the closing of their bank due to the larger  bank franchises paring down their branch networks in lower volume communities to trim overhead  expense. If we were subject to stifling climate-related credit limits it would be devastating.    Thank you for your consideration of our comments around climate-related financial risk.    Sincerely,    Jamie Shinabarger  President & CEO, Springs Valley Bank & Trust Company  Jasper, IN   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing in response to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of Summit  Bank in Eugene, Oregon. We are a nearly $1 billion community bank with a focus on business, SBA, and  equipment lending and the only bank headquartered in our county. We are highly engaged in our  community and attentive to risk management. I am concerned that the proposed framework for  managing climate-related financial risk management for large banks will negatively impact community  banks and the communities that we serve for reasons stated below.  DIVERSION OF RESOURCES AWAY  FROM THE COMMUNITY TO BANK ADMINISTRATION * Considering the fact that data and tools to  measure and quantify climate-related financial risks are not fully developed, the complexity of scenario  anlysis will require community banks to hire costly third-party consultants to perform the work. *  Availability of qualified third-partly consultants will be limited as there will be few if any currently  qualified in our community. * The ramp-up time and cost to hire or train existing staff will divert  personnel and funding dollars away from lending to the small business that are the backbone of our  community.  REDUNDANCY OF PRACTICES * Existing risk management practices are effective and have  enabled community banks to manage climate-related risks for decades. * Community banks already  actively stress test loan portfolios to identify risk impact of potential default for various scenarios. * The  current transition to CECL presents additional attention to risk through comprehensive modeling  analysis.  ADVERSE IMPACT TO SMALL BUSINESSES * Most business customers will lack the expertise to  provide the climate data community banks will be required to gather. * The cost to implement the  additional framework will tighten margins resulting in rate increases and costs to the small businesses  community banks support.  ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL * Circumstances are different for each  institution with respect to size, business model and client portfolio. * Supervisory expectations  concerning scope and the extent of data or scenario analysis capabilities should reflect the nature of the  institutions loan concentrations and risk exposure. * Given the small size, relative non-complexity and  lower risk profile of community banks compared to large banks, the scenario analysis presents an  unnecessary burden to community banks.  We would appreciate your consideration of the above  mentioned items. As you know, community banks are a key component of the economy and the most  significant lending channel providing funding to small businesses across the country.  Thank you for your  continued support of community banks. Please feel free to contact me directly at 541-684-7533, at any  time.    Sincerely,    Craig Wanichek - President and CEO 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am submitting this letter in response to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles  for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am the EVP of The  Commercial Bank in Honea Path, South Carolina. We are a $250 million community bank with six  branches in the upstate of South Carolina. Two of our six branches are located in small towns where we  are the only bank within a 10-12 mile radius for those communities.  I am concerned that the FDIC may,  in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community banks. Our existing risk  management practices are effective and have enabled community banks, like us, to manage climate- related risk for decades. Community banks do not pose a systemic risk to the financial system, like large  banks do. We should never be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk management  framework designed for large, complex institutions. This would be expensive and would also duplicate  current risk management practices that are currently in place.  If our community bank was required to  conduct scenario analysis and gather climate data from our rural customers, many of which do not  maintain this data and would strongly object to the additional cost they would incur, it would likely drive  many out of the banking system or out of business all together. This would also create another huge  expense to community banks as we would need to hire qualified climate risk experts to perform such  analysis. This in itself would be very difficult, as there are very few qualified professionals in our  community to perform this work.  Thank you so much for the opportunity to submit comments on the  proposed framework. I also want to thank the FDIC for limiting its proposal to banks with more than  $100 billion in assets and encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to better  understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.    Mr. C. Nakia Davis   Honea Path, SC   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large institutions. I am currently the Chairman of The Peoples Bank Co a  community bank with $680 million in assets located in rural west central Ohio. Our primary market area  is Mercer County which is the #1 agricultural county in Ohio. I am concern that FDIC will in the future  apply this climate-related financial risk management to my community bank. Community bankers are  risk adverse by nature, and because of the cost of compliance it often renders our only option to comply  with regulatory mandates like this one to simply abandon the the product or customers. As we have  seen with TRID and consumer mortgages and BSA and money servicing business. For over 117 years we  have applied effective risk management practices to manage climate-related risk in a safe and sound  manner. At our size we are not a systemic risk to the financial system. It is also obvious to me that we  could not attract or afford the expertise internally to perform the required outreach and analysis of our  customers to comply with your proposed climate-related risk management. It makes the proposal cost  prohibitive because much of the assessment would need to be outsourced. My bank was formed in 1905  and has been servicing our local agricultural community every since, don't make us abandon those  customers because of the burdensome climate-related risk management requirements. We are a local  community bank so our risk will always be concentrated in the communities we serve. Thank you for the  opportunity to submit my comments on the proposed climate-related financial risk management for  large institutions (more than $100 billion in assets).    Thank you,    Jack Hartings  Chairman The Peoples Bank Co.   Coldwater, OH     
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment of its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of Tioga State Bank  N.A., a $560 million community bank located in Spencer, NY. Our bank has been operating in Upstate  New York since 1864 as a commercial bank providing residential, small business and agricultural loans in  our market. I am very concerned that the proposed framework for managing climate-related financial  risk management for large banks will trickle down and negatively impact community banks throughout  the country.  Our bank has been managing climate risk since 1864. We have weathered numerous  blizzards, ice storms, floods, and droughts in our 150+ year history. We experienced two 100-year floods  over the past sixteen years, one in 2006 and another in 2011 that devastated many homes and  businesses in our community, however the bank came through both events with little to no losses. We  also assisted many of our customers and provided zero interest and low interest rate loans to many to  help them through the recovery process. Having been in business through various climate cycles over  150 years shows evidence that we know how to manage and mitigate that risk.  To my knowledge there  has not been a bank failure due to climate change or even climate transition. Our country has gone  through many different transitions over the last 150 years that banks have certainly been able to  manage. Our banking system is extremely resilient and showed that during the recent Covid pandemic.  I  understand the transition risks as we try to move our country away from fossil fuels. However, I don't  anticipate the transition risk to be a major impact in our market. It is interesting that there continues to  be differing opinions about the move away from fossil fuels to renewable sources. The book, Unsettled  by Steven E. Koonin and a recent opinion article in the Wall Street Journal, Fossil Fuels' Forthright  Defender both provide differing opinions on our ability to affect climate change and transition away  from fossil fuels. Additionally, community banks have proven time and time again that we are nimble  and work with our customers and course correct as needed when wide-sweeping changes do occur.  The  proposal would require large banks to perform scenario analysis via computer modeling to determine  the future impact on the bank due to changes in the economy, financial system and or physical hazards  due to climate-related events. Truthfully, I find this modeling to be senseless. Scientists have not been  able to use computer modeling to recreate past weather events much less predict the future. There are  just too many variables.  We all know that regulations, including climate change risk management, tend  to trickle down to smaller banks as best practices. I am very concerned about the additional costs to  bring in so-called ""climate experts"" to help us manage this ""new"" risk. There will be many new climate  expert consultants who will make some significant money when this is implemented.  Requiring  community banks to gather climate data from our customers will also be problematic. Most of our small  business customers would have no idea of how to determine this data, much less be willing to collect 
and disclose the data to their bank.  It is concerning that this framework could discourage banks from  doing business with legal but climate disfavored industries. In the Northeast, most homes in our area are  heated with fuel oil. There are many small businesses that are tied into this industry, from fuel oil  dealers to furnace install and repair shops. If these businesses are shunned from the banking system,  who will step in to fill this role? This could lead to another ""Operation Chokepoint"" to target businesses  that may be out of favor with the administration and therefore, have a severe negative affect on rural  America and the many small communities and small businesses  I appreciate that the FDIC is giving us  the opportunity to weigh in on this important subject and hope you consider this in the implementation  of the proposed framework. I appreciate that the framework is limited to banks over $100 billion in  assets and would encourage the FDIC to ensure the framework does not trickle down to community  banks as a best practice.    Sincerely,    Robert M. Fisher   President & CEO     1 N. Main Street  PO Box 386   Spencer, NY 14883-0386     
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing on behalf of Troy Bank & Trust regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement  of principles for climate-related financial risk management. Troy Bank & Trust has been serving  communities for over 115 years. Organized in 1906 as an independent community bank in Southeast  Alabama and now with 14 locations, our customers rely on us to serve the financial needs in our  communities.  As a community bank, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate- related financial risk management to community banks. I believe a separate risk-management  framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to manage safety and soundness at my bank  or any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets. Our bank currently applies risk  management practices and utilizes business continuity/disaster plans, concentration risk management,  underwriting practices/estimating ALLL, and securing insurance policies to offset risk, among others.  Existing risk management practices are effective and have enabled community banks to manage  climate-related risk for decades.  Additionally, unlike large banks, community banks do not pose  systemic risk to the financial system and should never be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related  financial risk management framework designed for large, complex institutions. As with any new  proposal, gathering the data, researching the required information for scenario analysis, and hiring  qualified experts can become financially burdensome. To comply with this framework would be  expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate current risk management practices. For example, with the  adoption of CECL, the bank must be even more concerned with reflecting future risk, such as the risk  that the climate will change, in loan loss reserves.  Troy Bank has helped customers through weather- related events since inception. When tornadoes, floods, and other severe weather issues have impacted  the communities we serve, we have responded to our customers' needs, worked with them through  their recovery period, and helped them to rebuild. These are not only our customers but our neighbors,  and they know that they can count on us due to our longstanding relationship. This differentiates  community banks from the large firms.  I thank you for limiting the proposal to banks with more than  $100 billion in assets and encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to better  understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks. Thank you for the opportunity to  write this comment letter.    Ms. Jennifer Pelham   Troy, AL   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing today in reference to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. This is a topic that affects us  all, and as a community bank, it particularly affects us. I am the President of an $840 million community  bank located in St. Louis, MO. We served small businesses and predominantly focus on mom and pop  businesses looking to get started or expand their businesses. We work daily in our community serving  those who are chasing the ""American Dream"". Our clients aren't big business. They are not large  multinationals. They aren't faceless entities pushing their weight around to get their way. They are  normal Missourians, just looking to have a better life through entrepreneurship and hard work. At  almost 130 years old our institution has responded to, survived, and helped our community recover  from catastrophes and natural disasters. We are the stewards of our community and are best in a  position to see what is going on in our area. Overly burdensome, unnecessary, and speculative criteria  will not further protect our community. We are on the ground here and have been on the ground  helping to protect our community and the local ecosystems. I am worried about the proposed climate- related financial risk management applications on community banks. In our industry, there is always a  trickledown effect on regulations. Regulations tailored for and promised to only be applied to large  institutions, almost always eventually make their way down to the smallest institutions. These  community banks are least able to absorb further bureaucratic regulations. The proposed framework  will have an impact. It will strain our already very strained resources. Community banks do not have the  resources to stress test or analyze remote, highly speculative, or unquantifiable climate change  assumptions. Further, the mandatory climate change disclosure requirements would be burdensome, to  say the least. We do not have large-scale back-office teams to generate all of these things. Further,  these disclosures could easily be viewed as a way to penalize disfavored industries and become  politicized. While targeted incentives work, I fully support them. This sort of regulatory expansion based  on speculative assumptions does nothing positive for our industry or the climate. Before implementing  the proposal the Financial Stability Oversight Council in conjunction with the banking agencies should  conduct outreach meetings with community bankers. This would ensure proper perspective is received  and make sure it does not unfairly penalize or overburden community banks. I thank you for allowing  me the opportunity to send this letter. I do acknowledge and thank you for attempting to limit the  effects to banks over $100 billion. I ask you to please consider having outreach meetings with  community banks.

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of Union Bank Inc.,  a $375 million community bank located in Middlebourne, WV. We primarily provide consumer mortgage  loans, commercial real estate loans, and commercial / industrial loans to our rural northern WV markets.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to  community banks. I believe that climate-focused risk-management framework for community banks is  unnecessary, for the following reasons: * Existing risk management practices are effective and have  enabled community banks to manage climate-related risk for many years. * Unlike large banks,  community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system and should not ever be subject to a  ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk management framework. * Compliance with a climate- related financial risk management framework would be expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate  current risk management practices.  My bank has been practicing climate-related risk management for  decades. For example: West Virginia, including our area, is prone to flash flooding. These natural events  have been occurring long before there was concern about climate-related weather events. We have  managed for this risk, and will continue to do so, by requiring flood insurance for property located in  flood-prone areas.  As to transitional risk (due to transition to a low-carbon economy), we have also  been managing this type of risk for decades. West Virginia has produced fossil fuels for over 100 years.  Community banks like mine, serving communities that are dependent upon these industries, have  managed through the significant volatility of the fossil fuel markets for many years. We are well aware  of, and plan for, this volatility.  Further, with the adoption of CECL, my bank and other community banks  will be required to consider future risks, such as potential climate-related risk, in our loan loss reserve  modeling.  The concept of Scenario Analysis, if required for community banks, is particularly troubling  and concerning. It should not be required of community banks, for the following reasons:  * Scenario  Analysis would require community banks to forecast for remote, isolated, and speculative risks and be of  little practical utility to community banks that are already familiar with their concentration risks and  how to manage these risks. * To conduct scenario analysis for transition risks, community banks would  need to gather climate data (such as greenhouse gas emissions data) from their customers, many of  which do not maintain this data nor would they have the resources to gather it.  The cost of scenario  analysis for community banks and their customers would be prohibitive, and would provide little if any  real benefit.  Again, with the requirement of CECL to provide a forward-looking analysis for loan loss  reserve adequacy, community banks like mine will already be practicing a type of scenario analysis.  My  bank, like nearly all community banks, is non-complex and of an overall lower risk profile than the  largest banks. There is no need to apply complex risk modeling such as Scenario Analysis to a community 
bank.  I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed framework. I encourage FDIC to  conduct outreach to community bankers in order to develop a better understanding as to why this  proposal should not, nor ever, apply to community banks.    Sincerely,    Tim Aiken   Union Bank Inc.   Middlebourne, WV   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      To Whom It May Concern: This letter is written in regards to FDIC's request for comment on its  statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am  President and CEO of Vermilion Bank & Trust Company, which is a small community bank that opened  over 60 years ago. Our bank serves a diverse group of customers in the rural town of Kaplan as well as  other small communities in the surrounding area. Vermilion Bank has $160 million in assets and  primarily provides commercial and agricultural loans. I would like to express our opposition to this  Proposed Rule as it may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to  community banks which would negatively impact Vermilion Bank in addition to our community. I do  believe a separate risk-management framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to  manage safety and soundness of any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets. Existing  risk management practices are effective and have enabled community banks to manage climate-related  risk for decades. Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system  and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk management  framework designed for large, complex institutions. Compliance with a climate-related financial risk  management framework would be expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate current risk  management practices. Due to our location we have witnessed devastating hurricanes and the stress  this storms can have on our customers financially. We have always strived to help our community in  these times by allowing extensions on monthly loan payments, allowing them time to recoup in the  aftermath. Community banks are already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage  these risks. With the adoption of CECL, our bank has implemented even more conservative approach to  reflecting future risks in loan loss reserve and stress testing the loan portfolio as part of CECL. Scenario  analysis is an expensive exercise that would require specialized third-party expertise, and it should not  be mandatory for community banks, given the small size, relative non-complexity and lower risk profile  of our community bank. Vermilion Bank is one of only four small community banks remaining in our  location. Losing a bank in our rural community due to regulatory burden would be a significant  detriment for local small businesses seeking access to credit. These businesses need greater access to  credit and not additional barriers. I would like to close by saying how much I appreciate your time, and  to thank you for the opportunity to express our concerns with this proposed rule. We are grateful for  FDICs limiting its proposal to banks with more than $100 billion in assets and would like to encourage  the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to better understand why this proposal should  never apply to community banks.    Sincerely,    Joseph A Couvillon,   President and CEO, Vermilion Bank & Trust Co  Kaplan, LA 
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am taking the time to personally write you regarding the FDIC’s request for comment on its statement  of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the  President of a small bank in the heart of the Coalfields of Southern West Virginia. Whitesville State Bank  was founded in 1946 and we just celebrated our 76th anniversary. We have a history of serving the coal  community and in a small way the coal industry. It is our way of life as well as the vast percentage of  economic opportunity for our citizens and thus, our bank. WSB is a $130 million dollar institution that  primarily serve consumers with Home Mortgage Loans, other consumer loans, and a small commercial  portfolio, all of which we keep on our books. We serve Boone, Raleigh, Wyoming, Fayette, and Kanawha  Counties with most of our customers living in distressed rural areas. In my 36 years as a community  banker, I have never seen the FDIC fine tune a regulation so that it does not affect small community  institutions and those effects are vastly more punitive to us. The cost us more via a myriad of negative  consequences that are an afterthought to the large institutions the regulations are written for. My  concerns are primarily outlined below:  • The continued spread of regulation and restrictions aimed at limiting GHG has already drastically  damaged our state’s economy. That impact will continue to increase negatively, and no consideration  will be given to the lives ruined in its wake. The regulation drops a bomb on our people, and they are  expected to simply move somewhere else. Their life’s work destroyed in the rear-view mirror.  • We currently manage climate related risk on an ongoing basis to ensure our services continue to flow  to our community, come what may. We plan, we test, and we implement common sense controls that  satisfy regulation and work.  • Unfortunately, we are too small to not fail. If we disappear tomorrow, it will be a blip on the FDIC’s  Insurance Funds radar. They won’t miss us, but this economy, this community, and this state, certainly  will if this death by 1,000 cuts continues.  • The expenses associated with this duplicative risk management will be very high for community banks.  We smother daily under the costs associated with the onslaught of compliance related expenses that  have poured out of D.C since the implementation of Dodd Frank. There will be a tipping point for us all  financially. Many have already tipped, as is evident by the sellout/burnout rate of community banks. It is  staggering and killing rural America.  • The personnel and expertise needed to run this new risk management process will be hard if not  impossible to find in rural America. We will struggle to train and fill the positions needed. That will only  add to the problems of BCP that all small banks face today.  WSB has navigated the rocky road of a commodity-based economy our entire existence. We plan for it  and we have weathered each storm that has come. We suffer with the people we serve and stand with 
them to make the best life possible for our citizens and state. It hasn’t always been pretty, but we adapt,  we plan, we mitigate, and we move on. I fear we are approaching a bridge to far from a regulatory  standpoint. We have been for years and continue to manage our climate related risks on a continuous  basis. We have been flooded twice over a 12-month period in the late 90’s at the main office in  Whitesville. We cleaned the catastrophe up ourselves and never closed a day or interrupted any  services. We have had blizzards, ice storms, derecho’s, power outages, and our mitigation strategies  have worked every time. We require flood insurance for customers, and we carry flood insurance for  ourselves where needed. All of what I have described was planned for, tested, mitigated, and retested  at great expense. Much more expense than the actual events caused us. The transitional risk that will  come from your new initiatives and the eventual continued decline the fossil fuel industry will  experience, will be hard to navigate. We however have been navigating this decline, whether market  driven, or regime change driven, for our entire 76 years of existence. This transitional future does not  look bright, but we will plan for it, survive it, and continue to serve whatever community we have left.  Further, with the adoption of CECL, my bank and other community banks will be required to consider  future risks, such as potential climate-related risk, in our loan loss reserve modeling. The concept of  Scenario Analysis, if required for community banks, is particularly troubling and concerning. WSB, like  nearly all community banks, is non-complex and of an overall lower risk profile than the largest banks.  There is no need to apply complex risk modeling such as Scenario Analysis to a community bank.  It should not be required of community banks, for the following reasons:  • Scenario Analysis would require community banks to forecast for remote, isolated, and speculative  risks and be of little practical utility to community banks that are already familiar with their  concentration risks and how to manage these risks.  • To conduct scenario analysis for transition risks, community banks would need to gather climate data  (such as greenhouse gas emissions data) from their customers, many of which do not maintain this data,  nor would they have the resources to gather it and will be furious that we ask for it    This expensive proposition would accomplish little and be impossible for small community banks to  absorb. The backlash to the process from our communities will cause reputational risk that will greatly  outweigh the new risk you are trying to measure. We continue to be told by our regulators what an  important role community banks play in our economy, society, and nation. Almost every agency I have  met with starts their presentation with those comforting words. Maybe it is possible to create banking  regulation that won’t trickle down to the bottom of the barrel where we are and drown us. My problem  is you haven’t been able to accomplish that in my 36-year career at WSB! I fully believe this flawed  initiative will be at my doorstep in short order if it is put into effect. If we are vital to our economies,  society, and nation, as we are told, then someone at the FDIC needs to hear and see what this will do to  the community banking industry!    Sincerely,    Robert L. Milam Jr.

Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing to you today regarding the FDIC's request for comment on proposed principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am a fourth generation community  banker and owner in Minnesota. Our Holding Company, Wilcox Bancshares, Inc. is a multi-bank holding  company with Grand Rapids State Bank serving rural northern MN and Minnesota Lakes Bank serving  the suburbs west of the Minneapolis market.  I have concerns about this FDIC proposal and the fact that  it could, in the future, be applied to the community bank sector. The proposed frame work for managing  climate-related risk at large banks would certainly affect my banks negatively and further I believe it  would negatively impact the community banking system at large.  I would contend that existing risk  management practices in community banks, generally under $100B in size, are and have been effective  and have enabled these community banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. Further, unlike  large banks, community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system and should never be  subjected to one-size-fits-all regulation.  Lastly, the proposed scenario analysis is an expensive exercise  that requires specialized third-party expertise, and it should not be mandatory community banks given  the small size, relative non-complex nature of our business model and the lower risk profile of  community banks when compared to large banks.    Thank you for inviting comment and allowing me to share the high points of my concerns with you.    Mr. Noah Wilcox   President, CEO & Chairman Wilcox Bancshares, Inc.   Grand Rapids, MN   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing in regard to the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions.  I am the CEO of Wyoming Bank &  Trust, a $300 million community bank located in Cheyenne and Burns, Wyoming. We were founding in  1919 by local farmers and ranchers in Burns, Wyoming and have been providing ""One on One""  personalized service to our customers ever since. We provide ag and real estate lending to our  community and are the only bank presence in Burns, Wyoming.  As we have seen many times before, I  am worried about the proverbial ""camel's nose under the tent"". I am concerned that the FDIC may, in  the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community banks. We have been  told time and time again that certain regulation will only apply to large institution to only end up having  to address many of these regulations ourselves with added costs that benefit no one.  Thank you for the  opportunity to comment and to limit this proposal to large banks. I encourage you, if any of these  regulations do get implemented, to ensure that they cannot affect small community banks now or in the  future.    Jeff Wallace   Cheyenne, WY   
Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:      Thank you for your service to the banking industry!  I am contacting you to express my concerns that  additional climate related financial risk management would provide an increased regulatory burden.  Financial institutions have dealt with climate issues including hurricanes, floods, droughts since banking  began, and we are equipped to continue to operate our banks in a safe and sound manner while  managing risks including climate.  I am Chairman of a $950 million community bank in Texas. We have  the oldest National Bank Charter in Texas. We have locations from DFW to rural areas north of Abilene.  We have successful experience dealing with agricultural borrowers who are experts in climate patterns  in three of our branches. In one of those locations, we are the only bank in the town.  Climate patterns  are cyclical and not new. While I would discourage you from applying additional regulation for any bank  including banks over $100 billion, I also thank you for limiting the scope. I am concerned that any new  requirement will eventually negatively affect our communities.  Thank you for your time and for the  opportunity to share my thoughts on this issue.    Sincerely,   Zan Prince   Willow Park, TX","The comment, submitted by Jenna Burke on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), addresses concerns regarding the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework for large financial institutions. The ICBA, representing numerous community banks, is worried that these regulations, although currently targeting large banks, may eventually be applied to community banks. The comment highlights that community banks, unlike large banks, do not pose systemic risks and have long managed climate-related risks effectively through existing practices.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am submitting this letter to you at the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. As President & CEO, I lead and  represent a small community bank of $305 million in assets that is located in the Mississippi Delta. We  are the only bank that is chartered and domiciled in Cleveland, Mississippi (we're the hometown bank!).  We also serve the Grenada and Merigold, Mississippi markets and are the only bank with a branch in  Merigold. We are proud to serve in this quite rural area of America. Our focus is only on these  communities within Bolivar and Grenada counties. We gladly accept all size loan requests (no loan too  small) as well as prioritize the true investment needs of our local communities.  While I have read and  understand that this proposed regulation is targeting the largest of banks, it is my great concern and  fear that FDIC authorities and examiners will eventually bring this regulation down to the smallest of  banks such as ours. The affordability of additional manpower, additional technology tools and external  specialized consultants will only add to the growing expense of these areas just to support regulatory  rules and regulations. As these costs rise, the ability to remain competitive and independent comes into  question. Yet it is our greatest desire to be just that as it is so very clear that local community banks best  serve small and rural communities as evidenced most recently by our support of the Payroll Protection  Program (PPP). Our bank originated almost 800 loans for almost $24 million throughout the 2 years in  our local communities with great commitment and efficiency.  The point is that regularly adding  regulatory requirements and responsibilities reduces our competitiveness and potentially reduces our  ability to provide credit to the local citizens and small businesses. Rural America needs local community  banks, not minimized branches of large banks.  From an actual physical risks management perspective,  we are experienced and seasoned in business continuity and disaster recovery. We have managed well  and operated through the pandemic, ice storms (loss of utilities) and even experienced a tornado 6  weeks ago within 200 yards of our main office (loss of power and part of property) and yet we quickly  adapted and put into place our existing procedures; thus, the need for additional regulation for small  banks is not needed. Community bankers are quite often seasoned experts and well versed in how to  adapt quickly.  In conclusion, I thank you for the opportunity to submit my comments and share my  concerns on future unintended consequences and their impact on those banks that best serve rural  America.    Respectfully,    Daniel Whalen   Cleveland, MS","Daniel Whalen, President & CEO of a small community bank in Cleveland, Mississippi, expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management regulations. While acknowledging the regulations target large banks, Whalen fears they may eventually apply to smaller banks like his, increasing costs for manpower, technology, and consultants. He argues that these added expenses could threaten the competitiveness and independence of small community banks, which are vital for serving rural areas. Whalen highlights his bank's successful management of local needs, such as the Payroll Protection Program, and its resilience in handling physical risks like pandemics and natural disasters. He contends that additional regulations are unnecessary for small banks, as they are already adept at managing risks. Whalen concludes by emphasizing the importance of community banks in rural America and warns against unintended consequences of regulatory expansion."

I believe trying to gauge climate change risk is a fools  errand, and a waste of time and money. It will be perceived (correctly) as a way for leftists to deny  funding to political unpopular industries like Oil and Gas, Coal, Trucking, Agriculture, mining, Real Estate,  etc. It will be totally subjective, and therefore another thing to get sued or fined for. Hurting the banking  industry.  We operate in an Agricultural and Oil Producing region. This initiative is much more likely to  damage our economy than anything climate change does. We make almost no loans longer than 10yrs,  except for loans we sell to the FHLB for real -estate. I can't imagine any hyped scenario that presents a  risk to us in the next 10 yrs.    Thank you    Dave Rebol   Fort Morgan, CO","Dave Rebol, a board member of a community bank, expresses strong opposition to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's initiative to assess climate change risk. He argues that this effort is futile and a misuse of resources, viewing it as a politically motivated attempt to restrict funding to industries such as oil, gas, coal, trucking, agriculture, mining, and real estate. Rebol believes the initiative is subjective and could lead to legal and financial repercussions for the banking industry. He emphasizes that in his region, which relies heavily on agriculture and oil production, the initiative could harm the local economy more than climate change itself. Rebol also notes that his bank rarely issues loans exceeding ten years, suggesting that climate change poses no significant risk to their operations within that timeframe."

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley: I am writing this letter in regard to the FDIC's request for comment on climate  related financial risk management. Farmers & Merchants Bank is a $260 million asset community bank  with five branches serving suburban and rural markets in Southwest Ohio. As President and CEO of our  community bank I appreciate your consideration of concerns with potential new rules that will  ultimately impact all FDIC regulated banks. While the current proposals are targeted at banks with over  $100 billion in total consolidated assets we all know that the same rules will either trickle down over  time or be applied to smaller institutions as ""best practices"".  Banks have always been, and always will  be, in the risk management business. While we do not specifically measure each and every type of risk,  but we do consider all risk factors before lending to our customers and helping them with their small  business and daily needs. While we have not historically used the term ""climate risk,"" it is specifically  considered and managed. We require our farmers to carry crop insurance that covers their crops from  catastrophic weather-related events. We require any building owner located in flood zone to carry flood  insurance. We talk with business owners about their internet technology, backups, and security if  applicable to the stability of their company. These are just a few obvious ways that for almost one  hundred years we have been around and able to manage and update as needed to mitigate potential  climate risk on a daily basis.  I can assure you that community banks do not pose systemic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management practices. We have always monitored our loans as a percentage of capital by types and  categories. This deliberate monitoring of concentration risk prohibits us from getting into any one  industry or type of lending too deep. We maintain less the 15% of capital to any one industry to  eliminate the risk of a catastrophic ending to any one industry. This helps manage all types of risk from  pandemic to climate risk, or just an overall failure in a certain industry due to supplies or changing times.   Having to conduct scenario analysis and additional modeling or monitoring would be yet another  regulatory burden to our institution. These proposals would create extra hours spent on each and every  loan in our portfolio that would likely also lead to the need for additional staff. There is no doubt that  these new proposals will not only be a time burden but also a significant cost burden. The time and staff  requirements would be a huge negative impact that would create a cost that would have to be passed  along to the consumers. In addition, these scenario analysis and future modeling generally end up  creating additional software expense to help try and effectively manage the process. Software always  has annual cost in addition to the larger one-time expense of purchasing and implementation.  In  summary, I strongly urge the FDIC considered what we are already doing to manage and mitigate  climate risk. Many banks have been around for over one hundred years and been very effective at  managing this risk without the ""help"" of these new proposals. This needs to be considered given the  limited resources available at small institutions and the great burden these reporting requirements  would create.  - Shon Myers, Miamisburg, OH","Shon Myers, President and CEO of Farmers & Merchants Bank, expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management rules, which currently target banks with over $100 billion in assets. He argues that these rules may eventually apply to smaller banks, like his $260 million asset community bank in Ohio. Myers emphasizes that community banks have long managed various risks, including climate risks, through practices like requiring crop and flood insurance. He contends that community banks do not pose systemic risks and should not be subject to ""one-size-fits-all"" regulations. Myers warns that the proposed rules would impose significant time and cost burdens, requiring additional staff and software expenses, which would ultimately affect consumers.

My name is Terri Barrett. I am the Market  President of Financial Security Bank in Kerkhoven, MN, a $137 million community bank located in Swift  County, Minnesota. We primarily provide agriculture loans and are the only bank with a physical  presence in Kerkhoven, MN.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate related  financial risk management to community banks. I believe existing risk management practices are  effective and have enabled community banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. We recently  experienced a severe weather-related event. Due to the strength of the thunderstorms in our area, our  bank was without power for 48 hours. Our Disaster Recovery Plan was created for incidents just like this.  Our team was successful in following the plan and had services restored for our customers within a few  hours using generator power. We persevered through the outage with very little inconvenience and  impact to our customers and could have continued if necessary. We have served this community for 138  years and are committed to ensuring we have adequate disaster recovery plans in place. This  commitment was proven during our most recent weather-related event.  I am also concerned about the  costs associated with scenario analysis. Scenario analysis is complex and would require community  banks to hire specialized third-party consultants to perform the work. Not only would these specialists  be expensive, but it would be difficult to hire qualified experts if we were competing for services with  large banks. There are few, if any, individuals located in our community who are qualified to perform  this work. Community banks are generally small, relatively non-complex, and have lower risk profiles  compared to large banks. Requiring scenario analysis would be of little practical benefit to community  banks that are already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage these risks.

To manage a successful community  bank, numerous risks are considered in everyday operations and strategies are in place to mitigate those  risks.

I am the Community President  of First Option Bank in Louisburg, KS, as well as on our Sr. Management Team that has banks in  communities surrounding the Kansas City Metro in Kansas and Missouri. Most of our banks are in  communities of less than 6000 people. We are a $600 Million community bank providing home loans,  small business and commercial loans, consumer loans and agriculture loans. In several of the  communities we are the most active lender remaining with a full service bank. After reading what you  have proposed, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-risk management to  banks like ours, a small community bank. This proposed framework would negatively impact my  communities. Community Banks with any exposure to agriculture have always been impacted by  climate-related risks. We've always accounted for those issues. Community Banks do not pose a  systemic risk to the financial system and a 'one size fits all' framework that is designed for large complex  institutions that do not know their clients well, or who do not live in the areas where climate impacts  occur regularly, could seriously affect our institution and the communities we serve. Dealing with the  costs and complexity of compliance as it currently is, and add something of this magnitude, and I feel  the expense would be insurmountable and unnecessarily duplicate our current risk management  practices. Weather has always played a role in our current practices when assessing loan loss provisions  and credit management. Living in Kansas, severe weather has always played a part in our daily lives.  Bankers in Kansas have always rallied to support their communities when tornados or other severe  weather incidents occur. With the adoption of CECL, we're already assessing risks such as climate, with  the booking of each loan. This proposed regulation would create additional response and costs to what  we're already doing.

The big banks do not care  as much about increased regulations because they have the resources to better manage the burden,  while small banks are squeezed out of existence. This leaves less competition for the big banks so they  can monopolize the market. Small community banks like Freedom Bank are the core to many small  towns and have a very positive impact on the health of their communities. The thought of adding  another unnecessary and ineffective regulatory burden related to climate change is absurd. The number  of community banks is on a steadily declining death march that is directly related to the crushing impact  of over regulation. In the past twenty years, the number of banks has been cut in half. In 2021, there  were 4,236 FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States. The number of such registered banks  has been declining since 2000, when there were over 8,300 FDIC-insured banks in the country. Please do  not put another nail in the coffin of community banks. I understand the proposal is initially intended for  banks over $100 Billion, but as we have seen repeatedly, those regulations eventually cascade down to  all banks. Enough is enough, please do not implement another meaningless, irrelevant, ineffective, and  burdensome regulation on the financial engine of small town USA!

I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate- related financial risk management to community banks and that the proposed framework for managing  climate-related financial risk management for large banks will negatively impact my community.   Community banks have decades of experience managing concentration risks and are experts at knowing  when and how to reduce their loan concentrations during economic downturns and how to mitigate  risks. Community banks' longstanding and tried-and-tested underwriting and insurance practices  sufficiently address climate-related financial risks, as evidenced by the absence of community bank  failures following weather events.  Since the early 19th century, community banks have prepared for,  responded to, and survived myriad natural disasters, including catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes,  flooding, droughts, wildfires, and wind events. Community banks, as stewards of their local  communities, are best positioned to monitor the overall risk of their geographically limited loan  portfolios and investment practices and should not be subject to overly burdensome, duplicative, or  unnecessary regulations aimed at controlling climate-related financial risks posed by complex, global,  and systemically important institutions.  Subjecting community banks to any type of mandatory climate  risk regulation, scenario analysis, or enhanced climate-disclosure requirements is not only expensive and  unnecessary it will also cause many small businesses that operate within community bank footprints to  be ""choked off"" from the financial system.

I am the Senior Lending Officer of a $185MM  community bank located in SE MN. We are based in Preston, MN and are the only bank with a physical  location serving that city. We also have branches in Chatfield and Rochester, MN. Close to half our loan  volume is to farmers in rural areas in SE MN and we also serve small business in those areas and in  Rochester.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this proposed framework for  managing climate-related financial risk management for large banks to community banks which will  negatively impact the communities we serve.  I believe there should be separate risk policies for  community bank $100B or less. Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose systemic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management framework designed for large, complex institutions.

Heartland bank exemplifies  the true meaning of a community bank. Our commercial lending focuses on our communities, lending  within niche markets, and helping start-ups get off the ground. We understand that when we lend to  businesses in our communities it strengthens our neighborhoods, provides jobs, revitalizes the  economy, and results in money going back into those same neighborhoods allowing them to prosper. I  am concerned that the proposed framework for managing climate-related financial risk management for  large banks will negatively impact the communities we serve.  As a community bank, we have a long  history of managing risk, including concentration risk and natural disasters, within our lending and  investment portfolios. Additional regulation is unnecessary for us to manage our climate related  financial risk. Our bank has long-standing and prudent underwriting and insurance practices that  sufficiently address climate risk and should not be overly burdened with duplicative and unnecessary  regulation that is aimed at larger and more complex institutions. Unlike large banks, we are not a  systemic risk to the financial system and should not be subjected to a one size fits all climate related risk  management framework. On January 1, 2023, we will be adopting CECL and will already be more  concerned about reflecting future risks, including climate related risk, in our loan loss reserve.  In  addition to the burden a required climate risk management framework would cause for community  banks is the concern related to the cost of such requirements like scenario analysis. Scenario analysis is a  complex process for which we would have to find a third-party consultant to perform, and which will  provide little value for the cost of a consultant as we are already familiar with our concentration risks. It  would also be difficult to gather climate data from our customers, and we are already stress testing our  loan portfolio.  Community banks have long been managing risks across the institution, including climate  related risks. We do not need the burden of additional regulation to interfere with the value we provide  our communities.

I am the CEO of Iowa Trust &  Savings Bank, a $425 million community bank with branches in Clive, Emmetsburg and Panora. Clive and  Panora are in the Des Moines, IA MSA. Emmetsburg is a rural community in north-central Iowa. We  primarily provide commercial real estate, agricultural and consumer real estate loans.  My concern is the  FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community banks. While  attending the ICBA Capital Summit in Washington DC earlier in May, Acting Chairman Gruenberg stated  during the FDIC presentation that climate-related financial risk management is for large institutions.  However, you understand my skepticism when similar statements have been made by regulatory  agencies in the past only to 'trickle down' to community banks and have 'one-size fit all'.  The following  is OCC Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu quote on March 7, 2022: ""This means that for midsize and  community banks, it will be a number of years before OCC examiners conduct climate risk management  examinations,"" Hsu said. ""My suggestion to those bankers has been simple: Use the time wisely. To the  extent that midsize and community banks can develop thoughtful, tailored assessments of their climate  risk profiles, they will help mitigate the risk of a 'trickle down' of large-bank climate risk management  expectations in the future.""  Iowa Trust & Savings Bank has been a lender to agri-businesses for 93  years. We understand better than most how to manage climate-related risk, and how climate effects the  livelihood of our farm customers and the success of Iowa Trust. To add additional climate-related  compliance requirements will likely duplicate existing practices and needlessly increase expenses. For  example, scenario analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise that would require community  banks to hire specialized third-party consultants to perform the work and potentially include forecasting  for remote and speculative risks. This would be of little practical utility to community banks that are  already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage these risks.  Currently, stress testing is  part of the transition to CECL. To expand this process to include gathering climate data from our  customers, and hiring qualified experts to perform scenario analysis, would provide little additional  value to determine the safety and soundness of Iowa Trust & Savings Bank.  Thank you for the  opportunity to submit comments on the proposed climate-related financial risk management.    Sincerely,   Kris M. Ausborn  CEO Iowa Trust & Savings Bank

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am sending this correspondence in response to the FDIC's request for on its statement of principles of  climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of  First Option Bank located in communities surrounding the Kansas City Metro in Kansas and Missouri.  Most of our banks are in communities of less than 6000 people. We are a $600 Million community bank  providing home loans, small business and commercial loans, consumer loans and agriculture loans. In  several of the communities we are the most active lender remaining with a full service bank. After  reading what you have proposed, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate- risk management to banks like ours, a small community bank. This proposed framework would  negatively impact my communities. Community Banks with any exposure to agriculture have always  been impacted by climate-related risks. We've always accounted for those issues. Community Banks do  not pose a systemic risk to the financial system and a 'one size fits all' framework that is designed for  large complex institutions that do not know their clients well, or who do not live in the areas where  climate impacts occur regularly, could seriously affect our institution and the communities we serve.  Dealing with the costs and complexity of compliance as it currently is, and add something of this  magnitude, and I feel the expense would be insurmountable and unnecessarily duplicate our current risk  management practices. Weather has always played a role in our current practices when assessing loan  loss provisions and credit management. Living in Kansas, severe weather has always played a part in our  daily lives. Bankers in Kansas have always rallied to support their communities when tornados or other  severe weather incidents occur. With the adoption of CECL, we're already assessing risks such as climate  with the booking of each loan. This proposed regulation would create additional response and costs to  what we're already doing. I personally thank you for limiting the proposal currently to banks over the  $100 billion in asset threshold and I strongly encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community  bankers to understand why this proposal should never trickle down to community banks.

2022-statement-principles-climate-related-financial-risk-management-3064-za32-c-065_29,"Mr. James P. Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    The FDIC is proposing that large financial institutions, defined as those with over $100 billion in total  consolidated assets, be subject to a climate-related financial risk management framework. To manage  climate-related financial risks, the FDIC has proposed a framework that would require large banks to  ensure climate-related financial risks are addressed in the bank's (1) governance; (2) policies, procedures  and limits; (3) risk management; and (4) data, risk measurement, and reporting. Additionally, the FDIC  would require large banks to address climate-related financial risk in the following risk areas: (1) credit  risk; (2) liquidity risk; (3) interest rate risk; (4) operational risk; (5) strategic planning; (6) reputational  risk; (7) liability or litigation risk.  I truly believe these steps are an overreach and are not necessary to  manage the safety and soundness of my community bank. In support of this belief I offer the following  reasons. * Existing risk management practices have been proven effective and have enabled community  banks to manage climate-related risk for decades. * Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose  systemic risk to the financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate- related financial risk management framework designed for large, complex institutions. * Compliance  with a climate-related financial risk management framework would be expensive and unnecessarily  duplicates current risk management practices.  The banking industry by its nature is involved in  assessing all types of risks and taking steps to mitigate and monitor risks. These are already incorporated  into our multitude of risk assessments and action plans. For example we monitor severe weather events  and have well established plans to execute. Example is past years of tornado activity in our area of  Missouri. How we have monitored economic factors for our loans which includes climate impact of  drought or too much rain, or hail events in our agriculture sector. Further our assessment of our reserve  for loan loss account we do review all these factors and run projections on potential impact to the loan  portfolio. Therefore, many of these factors sought to be addressed are already being done as normal  practice for banking and community banks in particular. The approach of scenario analysis is an  expensive exercise that requires specialized third-party expertise, and it should not be mandatory for  community banks, given the small size, relative non-complexity and lower risk profile of community  banks as compared to large banks. Finally, as part of the proposal it would require financial institutions  climate data from our customers. This will be extremely challenging and difficult for the customers of  community banks. Many of these customers will not have this information and will refuse to provide  such information. Will this lead us to point where banks will not be allowed to provide services to this  customer base and serve our mostly rural markets and communities? That is a strong and hopefully  unintended consequence of taking such steps and actions.    John Denkler   Farmington, MO","The comment by John Denkler addresses the FDIC's proposal for large financial institutions to adopt a climate-related financial risk management framework.

Denkler highlights that community banks, unlike large institutions, have a lower risk profile and should not be subjected to a one-size-fits-all approach. He also raises concerns about the requirement for banks to collect climate data from customers, which could be challenging and potentially lead to unintended consequences, such as limiting services to rural communities.

I am the Chief Credit Officer of Legence  Bank, a $650million asset bank headquartered in Eldorado IL. We serve 12 communities in Southern  Illinois and 1 in Evansville Indiana. As a community bank, we are focused on ensuring the needs of the  areas we are in are met. We are also in a heavily agricultural area.  Everything I have read and heard, the  proposed regulatory changes are targeted on banks with assets exceeding $100billion. But, I have also  been advise the FDIC is focused on climate change as a ""systemic issue in the banking industry"". My first  comment is this: additional regulatory scrutiny in the industry will put an undue burden on community  banks. We are faced with enough challenges to just find adequate loans with sufficient credit quality to  lend to in this rising rate environment. Additionally the ""costs for compliance"" today are becoming  exorbitant. Measuring the potential impacts of climate change on a community bank and its customers  goes well beyond the abilities and capabilities of community bankers. For the past 50 years the  ""experts"" have been predicting and analyzing climate change with the question of ""to what avail""? The  predictions these experts made have failed to come to fruition as predicted. How, then, are bankers able  to assess changes? We do not employ meteorologists on our staff, nor can we afford to. We need to  focus our efforts on what we do every day: serve the needs of our communities and our customers in  them.  Personally, I think the effort to have any bank, regardless of size, to measure this climate-related  impact goes too far. But for banks that are MUCH smaller it poses an undue hardship. I look at Legence  Bank for a moment. We have a large agriculture portfolio. We work with customers across several  counties. We bank large operations that farm 6,000 acres and some that farm 600. We discuss crop  insurance coverage; we analyze secondary repayment sources; we make sure we have hazard insurance  in place on structures (and we have purchased blanket insurance for smaller loans); we know our  customers. Our lenders attend seminars and learn from experts on not only the local agriculture  economy, but national and international. We understand that weather patterns change. Some years are  normal; some are dry; some are wet. We discuss marketing opportunities with our farm customers. We  are diverse too. We don't lend internationally. We work with our farm customers to utilize FSA guaranty  programs as appropriate to mitigate risks. In short, we do not pose a risk to the Banking industry. We  are family-owned for the majority. We are seeking to be a part of our communities for the long-haul.  However, forcing added burdens only seeks to lessen that option.  I implore the FDIC to reconsider its  efforts and, if this change must be implemented, wholly exempt banks that are like us.      Mr. Alan Jones   Evansville, IN","Mr. Alan Jones, Chief Credit Officer of Legence Bank, expresses concerns over the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk regulations for large financial institutions.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    My name is Randy Whitehead, President and CEO of PeoplesTrust Bank in HamiIton, Alabama. I am  writing to provide comments regarding the FDIC's statement of principles for climate-related financial  risk management for large financial institutions. I suspect that should these proposed requirements be  placed upon larger institutions it will only be a matter of time before smaller institutions will have  similar requirements.  I submit to you that the risk of ever-increasing regulation and the related  expense, creates a much greater risk to rural community banks than does climate change risk. As you  know the tremendous expense involved in complying with this regulation would be a huge burden on  small community banks. The banks which are the financial lifeblood of rural towns and communities are  either being consolidated into larger institutions or are closing branches in small towns partially due to  the ever-increasing cost of regulation, leaving the people of these communities with the only option of  driving many miles to participate in the banking system.  Our small City of Hamilton, Alabama has a  branch of a major nationwide banking institution. While that institution is pleased to operate here and  offer a myriad of checking accounts which provide that institution with low-cost deposits to be utilized  around the country, local individuals and small businesses find it difficult to obtain loans at that  institution. My point, obviously, is that without small, local community banks, people in rural  communities are going to be greatly harmed and unable to participate in the financial system.  Climate  change is ultimately ""weather"" which fluctuates and cycles over time within a fairly narrow range. As  high school students in the 1970's we observed that the climate scientists of the time were predicting  that the earth was entering into the next ""ice age"". How wise would it have been to commit millions and  billions of dollars over the course of the past 50 years preparing for the risk associated with another ice  age?  We operate a branch in Hackleburg, Alabama, a small town that was almost totally destroyed in  the tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011. We were able to work with our customers in the aftermath of  that disaster and in the years since the tornado the town has become better and stronger. Having  witnessed the devastation personally, I can attest that no amount of risk management would have  reduced the damage done by the F-5 tornado that day. In addition, many of our customers, operated  heavy equipment (fueled by diesel and gasoline) to clear the debris from the destruction and help  residents get on with their lives.  While I am pleased that this proposal is currently limited to banks of  $100 billion or more in total assets, I also know that many times, limited application regulations are  ultimately applied to all banking institutions. I respectfully request that the FDIC refrain from  implementing climate related risk management requirements that will ultimately do serious financial  damage to the residents of the rural communities we serve.    Sincerely,

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing to you regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate- related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of North  Central Bank, a $150 million dollar community bank with corporate headquarters located in Hennepin,  IL. We have two locations (Hennepin and Ladd) and they are both in very rural settings in communities  with populations of less than 1,200 residents each. We primarily provide agricultural loans and  residential real estate loans. We are the only banks within our communities with a physical location. At  this time, I am very concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk  management to community banks. I further fear that this type of risk-management could negatively  impact my communities and apply additional undue burden on our small bank. I believe that a separate  risk-management framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to manage safety and  soundness at our bank or any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets.  Our bank has  serviced the local communities for over 75 years and the existing risk management practices are  effective and have enabled us and other community banks to manage climate-related risk for decades.  Unlike large banks, small community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system and should  not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk management framework that is  designed for institutions that are large and complex. In our rural community bank setting, we have  managed to retain extremely talented employees that adequately manage our risk profile. Compliance  with a climate-related financial risk management framework would be expensive and would  unnecessarily duplicate many of our current risk management practices.  We believe that climate- related financial risks do not threaten the safety and soundness of our community bank. We have two  locations, over 18 miles apart, utilizing different communication/data systems, along with having our  entire network on the cloud. All of our senior management, lenders and operations staff are able to  work from home and VPN into our secure system should a climate-related disaster/event occur.  Numerous table-top testing events are held throughout the year and many weather related events are  considered. We have identified locations that can be utilized should our community bank need to be  temporarily closed for repair, thus allowing us to service all of our customers in a timely and safe  environment. Also, with the adoption of CECL, we will continue to take into account all future risks, such  as the risk that the climate will change and adjustments to our risk factors and loan loss reserves will be  continually reviewed/updated.  Additionally, any scenario analysis for a small community bank, like  mine, would be an expensive exercise that would require specialized third-party expertise. The scenario  analysis is a complex, data-driven modeling exercise that would require a community bank to forecast  for remote and speculative risks and provide little to no practical utility to community banks that are  already familiar with their concentration risks and how to appropriately manage them.  In conclusion, I 
would like to thank you for your time and the FDIC for the opportunity to submit comments on the  proposed framework. I would like to also thank the FDIC for limiting its proposal to banks with more  than $100 billion in assets and continue to encourage the FDIC to conduct additional outreach to  community bankers to better understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.    Kim McKee   Hennepin, IL","Kim McKee, President and CEO of North Central Bank, expresses concerns about the FDIC's climate-related financial risk management principles potentially being applied to community banks.

The bank has effectively managed climate-related risks for decades using existing practices.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing this comment letter regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles  for climate-related financial risk management for large institutions. New Market Bank is a small  community bank with assets of approximately $190MM (prior to the pandemic we were only  approximately $125MM in assets). We have three locations in Elko New Market, Lakeville and Prior Lake  which are suburbs of the southern Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN metro area. We have 40 people on our  team in total which includes everyone from tellers at all our locations to me who is CEO, President and  CFO of our small organization. Most of the loans we make are to small businesses that help to either  finance larger purchases such as buildings or equipment to smaller operating lines of credit. We also  have a 2nd market mortgage department which consists of 7 of those 40 team members.  The main  reason that I am submitting a comment letter is because I am concerned the FDIC may in the future  apply this climate-related financial risk management framework to community banks. Community banks  do not pose a systemic risk to the financial system and already work hard to implement risk  management practices that are effective to managing the safety and soundness of our institutions.  These risk management practices already have considerations for potential climate-related risks woven  into the program. For example, the recent adoption of CECL requires banks to have a forward-looking  approach to risks on the economy through use of qualitative factors. Along with CECL, community banks  also have implemented stress testing on their loan portfolio to understand how various stress levels  would affect the level of reserves the bank would need to survive.  The most concerning part of the  proposal however is the scenario analysis exercise. The idea that a community bank may have to  eventually complete a scenario analysis that explores the impacts of climate-related risk on our strategy  and business model as well as identify and measure vulnerability to relevant climate-related risk factors  including physical and transition risk is overwhelming to say the least. This analysis would no doubt force  us to hire a 3rd party as we would not have the expertise on our team to complete the exercise  internally. It appears that in order to complete such a scenario analysis, we would also need to gather  climate data from our customers which could be nearly impossible as small businesses do not maintain  this data and would also have an objection to starting to collect it and then having to disclose it to us.  Finally, the results of the analysis would most likely not have any practical use for us as the likelihood of  these climate-related risks are remote and the impact is minimal. This exercise would just place another  expense burden on community banks which in turn decreases earnings and makes it harder to compete  against other larger financial institutions.  In conclusion, I sincerely hope the information provided in this  comment letter helps you to understand the challenges smaller community banks would face in  complying with a climate-related risk management program. The cost of implementing such a program  would be significant to a smaller institution with no real identifiable benefit. I appreciate the 
opportunity to share my comments and concerns. If there is any additional information that I could  provide that would help you understand the impact this potential rule could have on a community bank,  I am happy to be a resource.

Drentlaw highlights the challenges of conducting scenario analyses, which would require external expertise and customer climate data, posing a significant burden on small banks.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    PriorityOne Bank is a CDFI certified Community Bank with just over $900 million in assets,  headquartered in Magee, Mississippi, primarily serving the needs of small communities along the  Highway 49 corridor with branches as far south as Hattiesburg, MS and as far north as Ridgeland,  Mississippi. PriorityOne Bank submits this letter to the FDIC in response to the FDIC's request for  comments on its statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial  institutions. Specifically, PriorityOne Bank is concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this  climate-related financial risk management to community banks, which is unnecessary to manage safety  and soundness at any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets.  The primary concerns  affecting PriorityOne Bank are the FDIC's proposed framework that would require large banks to address  climate-related financial risk in its credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, strategic  planning, reputational risk and liability or litigation risk along with the requirement to perform scenario  analysis.  A separate risk management framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to  manage the safety and soundness at a Bank with just over $900 million in assets. The Bank's current  existing risk management practices are effective and have enabled community banks to manage  climate-related risk for decades. Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose systematic risk to the  financial system and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk  management framework designed for large, complex institutions. Compliance with a climate-related  financial risk management framework would be expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate current  risk management practices the Bank already has is place through Disaster Recovery, which was shown to  be effective through past climate events such as Hurricane Katrina or various disastrous tornadoes the  Bank has faced through the years. With regard to financial stress caused by transition risk, the Bank's  Disaster Recovery plan saw it through COVID and its aftermath, again stressing the unnecessary burden  of duplicate risk management.  Further, with the adoption of CECL, PriorityOne Bank will need to be  even more concerned about reflecting future risks, such as the risk that the climate will change, in loan  loss reserves. The costs of the proposal, especially regarding scenario analysis will be unnecessarily  burdensome.  Mandated scenario analysis is problematic as it is an expensive exercise that requires  specialized third-party expertise, and it should not be mandatory for community banks, given the small  size, relative non-complexity and lower risk profile of community banks as compared to large banks.  PriorityOne Bank already implements stress testing its loan portfolio as part of transitioning to CECL  which eliminates the need for performing scenario analysis. Further, in order to conduct scenario  analysis for transition risks, community banks would need to gather climate data (such as greenhouse  gas emissions data) from their customers, many of which do not maintain this data and would object to  gathering and disclosing this data, which is overly burdensome Further, scenario analysis would require 
community banks to forecast for remote and speculative risks and be of little practical utility to  community banks that are already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage these risk.  The Bank would face many difficulties in hiring qualified experts to perform scenario analysis,  particularly if forced to compete with large banks to secure these services, as there are few individuals  located in PriorityOne Bank's community who are currently qualified to perform this work.  In  summation, the proposed Climate-Related Financial Risk Management Framework and the  implementation of scenario analysis to explore the impact of climate-related risk on PriorityOne Bank's  strategy and business model to identity and measure vulnerability to relevant climate related risk factors  including physical and transition risks, is unnecessarily burdensome for an institution with just over $900  million in assets.  PriorityOne Bank thanks the FDIC for the opportunity to submit comments on the  proposed framework and further thanks the FDIC for limiting its proposal to banks with more than $100  billion in assets and would encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community Bankers to better  understand why this proposal should not apply to community banks.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    My name is Sarah Getzlaff. I am the CEO of Security First Bank of North Dakota, a $240 million  community bank in central North Dakota. I am a 3rd generation community banker following in the  footsteps of my father and grandfather. I grew up watching my dad support our community by donating  his time to economic development boards, making financial donations to community causes and by  meeting with customers whenever and wherever they needed him. I clearly remember him leaving our  house late one night to lend a customer cash out of his own wallet for a medical emergency after the  customer called in a panic. Stories like this were a constant part of my childhood and a tradition I am  honored to continue. Stories like this happen daily at community banks across the nation. Stories like  this need to continue, as they help small communities survive.  Security First Bank has five locations in  North Dakota, mostly in rural areas, and is very representative of a typical community bank. We opened  our doors in 1925. For the first seventy-five years, we operated solely in three communities with less  than 1,000 residents each, all of which have been faced with shrinking populations and struggling Main  Streets. In the early 2000's, we opened two additional locations in ""big cities,"" which have a combined  population of less than 100,000 residents.  I am writing to you today, as a community banker, regarding  the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related financial risk  management for large financial institutions. While my family's bank is clearly not a large financial  institution, I am incredibly concerned that the requirement for climate-related financial risk  management will trickle down to community banks like mine. Recent statements made by the FDIC that  ""all financial institutions should prepare for how you will manage climate related activities in the future""  have only intensified my concern.  Community banks like mine are incredibly important in small  communities; yet they are continuously being gobbled up by larger banks as regulations snuff out their  ability to remain independent. While I understand the need for regulation and the reason for many of  our existing regulations, I also believe that community banks are vastly different than large banks and  need to be regulated with significant regard given to these differences. I further believe the benefits of  regulations need to outweigh their costs - both financial and non - and that these benefits and costs will  be much different in a community bank than in a large bank.  The ""scenario analysis"" in the FDIC's  proposal would require specialized third-party expertise, something we will have to seek out and pay for  and then try to interpret, test and apply to our portfolios. While the cost of this service, along with  training our staff and possibly needing to hire additional staff to help with the regulatory burden, is  unknown, I do know that these costs will drive up the borrowing costs for small businesses and farmers.  Further, the customers we serve will not have the resources to gather meaningful climate-related  information for us to use. Now, if there was a measurable benefit to this additional regulation, it's  possible the costs could be justified. The truth is - there is no additional benefit from or need for this 
additional regulation. Community banks like mine have a long history of evaluating the risk of our  balance sheets and already have mechanisms in place with existing regulatory frameworks to monitor  and manage portfolio related risks. Further, our community bank does not pose a systemic risk to the  financial system like the ""too big to fail"" banks.  I am very concerned this added regulation could  ultimately choke off credit to legal and creditworthy borrowers and also cause more small community  banks like mine to sell off, further consolidating the industry. I am respectfully requesting the FDIC  refrain from implementing any climate related risk management framework at the community bank  level. Our family's bank has been a huge supporter of local farms and businesses and they have  supported us in return. We need this legacy to continue - not just for my families sake, but because in  small communities, we all know if we support one another, there is a greater chance our communities  will survive, our businesses will thrive and our schools will remain open and independent.

I am the CEO of Somerset Savings Bank in  Bound Brook, NJ, a $680 million mutual bank with 7 branch locations. We are primarily a 1-4 family  home mortgage lender.

Mr. James P. Sheesley  Assistant Executive Secretary  Attention: Comments—RIN 3064-ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I represent Springs Valley Bank & Trust Company, a six-location, 110 FTE, $508M community bank  located in rural Southwest Indiana. We are a state-chartered commercial bank, and our primary Federal  Regulator is the FDIC. Our business model is built around rural county seat markets as that is where we  compete the best and can be most impactful. Our $395M loan portfolio is approximately 24%  agriculture, 50% small business, and 26% consumer household. While we fully understand that the  current statement of principles would not apply to Springs Valley Bank & Trust, we are commenting  because the FDIC has indicated this is the first iteration of guidelines that may ultimately apply to all  FDIC insured banks. We appreciate the opportunity to make our voice heard by providing relevant  comments.    For your context, we are deeply committed to prudent small business lending and meeting the credit  and other banking needs in our generally small, rural communities. We have several concerns about the  proposed rule that could negatively impact our bank and the communities we serve. We do a  considerable amount of small business and agricultural lending to include business acquisition,  operating lines of credit, equipment financing, and long-term real estate mortgages. In an average year,  Springs Valley generates 300-400 small business loans (using the CRA definition of $1M or less GAR).    - In 2019 we originated 369 commercial loans with average gross revenue of $1,559,779.  - In 2020 we originated 825 commercial loans with average gross revenue of $1,579,074.  - In 2021 we originated 838 commercial loans with average gross revenue of $1,394,037.    In 2020 and 2021, we generated $21,738,003 (414) of PPP loans in Round 1 and $12,271,906 (408) of  PPP loans in Round 2. While PPP loans generated in 2020 and 2021 certainly drove up originations in  aggregate to about double the norm, GAR exceeded $1M on average in each of the three years and  remained remarkably consistent in the $1.5M range.    We believe that climate-related financial risk is already incorporated into our strategic and risk  management framework. We base our business decisions on current and historical market data, which  provides information on the risk of a transaction. Accordingly, climate related financial risks are  inherently embedded into the risk identification and management process.   
Springs Valley Bank manages and maintains over 50 policies bank-wide. We conduct over a half-dozen  additional annual risk assessments and plans. Many of these policies have climate-related components  (e.g. our Lending Policy addresses monitoring loan concentrations, requiring flood insurance, monitoring  fire and windstorm insurance coverage, conducting environmental assessments, etc.).    Given our location in the heart of the Midwest, more specifically within the Ohio River Valley between  St. Louis and Cincinnati, we are particularly susceptible to high humidity and near triple-digit summer  temperatures. Those conditions can result in tornadoes, seasonal flooding, occasional hailstorms, and  accompanying wind damage to crops, homes, and other structures. All geographies across this country  have unique properties and characteristics that may present localized challenges as out-of-state  examiners attempt to quantify and provide meaningful oversight for climate-related risks.    The SEC climate disclosure takes the climate-risk conversation in an entirely more troubling direction.  Centered around the concept of “financed emissions,” largely defined as calculating and reducing  carbon emissions across a bank’s loan portfolio, this extreme approach would have negative far- reaching borrower impact and pit some industry-specific investor economic interests against those of  climate advocates. Commercial borrowers would be required to create elaborate estimates of up and  downstream emissions. They would incur significant costs, hiring accredited experts to produce the  required reports and disclosures. Financial reporting standards would require low materiality footnotes.  FIs would likely play a record keeping role and run the risk of being put in an untenable role between  regulators and borrowers.    In response to all this attention being directed to climate concerns, we would make the case for flexible  supervisory expectations, allowing for significant modification as events occur, as the practice of climate  risk identification develops, and the risks become more clearly defined. Regulation based on  assumptions and data behind today’s definitions and understanding of climate related financial risk  would be premature. A high-level approach that allows banks to assess their risk based on unique  circumstances would seem the most prudent. We would be proponents of safe harbor provisions and a  generous time-frame implementation for all size banks, but in particular for mid-sized and small FIs,  should climate-related risk measures currently being crafted for large FIs trickle down to smaller.    We appreciate the FDIC’s recognition that these principles would impose significant burdens if applied  to smaller banks. If the FDIC ultimately determines that climate-related guidance is necessary for all  FDIC insured banks, the guidance should not be extended to mid-sized and smaller FIs until climate risk  is better quantified and understood and should be tailored to avoid unnecessary operational burdens. If  that day does arrive, we would be proponents of safe harbor considerations and a generous time frame  implementation period.    FIs are critical economic engines of commerce across the United States and provide households,  companies, or communities the necessary financing to thrive. It is important that the FDIC be cognizant  of and take adequate actions to avoid, the unintended consequences of economic disruption. We would  strongly caution prudential regulators against imposing overly prescriptive regulatory requirements on 
climate-related risks. Doing so at this time, particularly with respect to transition risks, could shape bank  business decisions for reasons of acquiescence, rather than out of pure safety and soundness concerns.  Banks and banking services are as a rule, sparser in our markets in rural Southern Indiana. There are  already many very small rural communities that have suffered the closing of their bank due to the larger  bank franchises paring down their branch networks in lower volume communities to trim overhead  expense. If we were subject to stifling climate-related credit limits it would be devastating.    Thank you for your consideration of our comments around climate-related financial risk.    Sincerely,    Jamie Shinabarger  President & CEO, Springs Valley Bank & Trust Company  Jasper, IN","The comment, submitted by Jamie Shinabarger, President & CEO of Springs Valley Bank & Trust Company, addresses concerns regarding the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management principles. While acknowledging that the current guidelines do not apply to their bank, Shinabarger expresses apprehension about potential future applications to all FDIC-insured banks, including community banks. The comment highlights the bank's existing risk management practices, which already incorporate climate-related risks, and argues against imposing additional regulatory burdens. Shinabarger emphasizes the unique challenges faced by rural banks and the potential negative impacts of stringent climate-related regulations, such as increased costs and operational burdens. The comment advocates for flexible supervisory expectations, safe harbor provisions, and a generous implementation timeframe for smaller financial institutions. It warns against premature regulation based on current assumptions and stresses the importance of avoiding economic disruption in rural communities. The comment concludes by urging the FDIC to consider the unintended consequences of overly prescriptive climate-related regulations."

I am the President and CEO of Summit  Bank in Eugene, Oregon. We are a nearly $1 billion community bank with a focus on business, SBA, and  equipment lending and the only bank headquartered in our county. We are highly engaged in our  community and attentive to risk management. I am concerned that the proposed framework for  managing climate-related financial risk management for large banks will negatively impact community  banks and the communities that we serve for reasons stated below.  DIVERSION OF RESOURCES AWAY  FROM THE COMMUNITY TO BANK ADMINISTRATION * Considering the fact that data and tools to  measure and quantify climate-related financial risks are not fully developed, the complexity of scenario  anlysis will require community banks to hire costly third-party consultants to perform the work. *  Availability of qualified third-partly consultants will be limited as there will be few if any currently  qualified in our community. * The ramp-up time and cost to hire or train existing staff will divert  personnel and funding dollars away from lending to the small business that are the backbone of our  community.  REDUNDANCY OF PRACTICES * Existing risk management practices are effective and have  enabled community banks to manage climate-related risks for decades. * Community banks already  actively stress test loan portfolios to identify risk impact of potential default for various scenarios. * The  current transition to CECL presents additional attention to risk through comprehensive modeling  analysis.  ADVERSE IMPACT TO SMALL BUSINESSES * Most business customers will lack the expertise to  provide the climate data community banks will be required to gather. * The cost to implement the  additional framework will tighten margins resulting in rate increases and costs to the small businesses  community banks support.  ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL * Circumstances are different for each  institution with respect to size, business model and client portfolio. * Supervisory expectations  concerning scope and the extent of data or scenario analysis capabilities should reflect the nature of the  institutions loan concentrations and risk exposure. * Given the small size, relative non-complexity and  lower risk profile of community banks compared to large banks, the scenario analysis presents an  unnecessary burden to community banks.  We would appreciate your consideration of the above  mentioned items. As you know, community banks are a key component of the economy and the most  significant lending channel providing funding to small businesses across the country.  Thank you for your  continued support of community banks. Please feel free to contact me directly at 541-684-7533, at any  time.    Sincerely,    Craig Wanichek - President and CEO","Craig Wanichek, President and CEO of Summit Bank, expresses concerns about the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework for large banks, arguing it could negatively impact community banks. He highlights several issues: 

1. **Resource Diversion**: Community banks may need to hire costly third-party consultants due to underdeveloped data and tools, diverting resources from community lending.

2. **Redundancy**: Existing risk management practices are already effective, and community banks actively stress test loan portfolios.

3. **Adverse Impact on Small Businesses**: Business customers may lack expertise to provide required climate data, and implementation costs could tighten margins, increasing rates for small businesses.

4. **One Size Does Not Fit All**: The framework should consider the unique circumstances of each institution, as community banks have a lower risk profile compared to large banks, making the proposed scenario analysis burdensome.

Wanichek urges consideration of these points, emphasizing the vital role of community banks in supporting small businesses and the economy."

I am currently the Chairman of The Peoples Bank Co a  community bank with $680 million in assets located in rural west central Ohio. Our primary market area  is Mercer County which is the #1 agricultural county in Ohio. I am concern that FDIC will in the future  apply this climate-related financial risk management to my community bank. Community bankers are  risk adverse by nature, and because of the cost of compliance it often renders our only option to comply  with regulatory mandates like this one to simply abandon the the product or customers. As we have  seen with TRID and consumer mortgages and BSA and money servicing business. For over 117 years we  have applied effective risk management practices to manage climate-related risk in a safe and sound  manner. At our size we are not a systemic risk to the financial system. It is also obvious to me that we  could not attract or afford the expertise internally to perform the required outreach and analysis of our  customers to comply with your proposed climate-related risk management. It makes the proposal cost  prohibitive because much of the assessment would need to be outsourced. My bank was formed in 1905  and has been servicing our local agricultural community every since, don't make us abandon those  customers because of the burdensome climate-related risk management requirements. We are a local  community bank so our risk will always be concentrated in the communities we serve.

I am the EVP of The  Commercial Bank in Honea Path, South Carolina. We are a $250 million community bank with six  branches in the upstate of South Carolina. Two of our six branches are located in small towns where we  are the only bank within a 10-12 mile radius for those communities.  I am concerned that the FDIC may,  in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to community banks. Our existing risk  management practices are effective and have enabled community banks, like us, to manage climate- related risk for decades. Community banks do not pose a systemic risk to the financial system, like large  banks do. We should never be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk management  framework designed for large, complex institutions. This would be expensive and would also duplicate  current risk management practices that are currently in place.  If our community bank was required to  conduct scenario analysis and gather climate data from our rural customers, many of which do not  maintain this data and would strongly object to the additional cost they would incur, it would likely drive  many out of the banking system or out of business all together. This would also create another huge  expense to community banks as we would need to hire qualified climate risk experts to perform such  analysis. This in itself would be very difficult, as there are very few qualified professionals in our  community to perform this work.  Thank you so much for the opportunity to submit comments on the  proposed framework. I also want to thank the FDIC for limiting its proposal to banks with more than  $100 billion in assets and encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to better  understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.

Troy Bank & Trust has been serving  communities for over 115 years. Organized in 1906 as an independent community bank in Southeast  Alabama and now with 14 locations, our customers rely on us to serve the financial needs in our  communities.  As a community bank, I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate- related financial risk management to community banks. I believe a separate risk-management  framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to manage safety and soundness at my bank  or any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets. Our bank currently applies risk  management practices and utilizes business continuity/disaster plans, concentration risk management,  underwriting practices/estimating ALLL, and securing insurance policies to offset risk, among others.  Existing risk management practices are effective and have enabled community banks to manage  climate-related risk for decades.  Additionally, unlike large banks, community banks do not pose  systemic risk to the financial system and should never be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related  financial risk management framework designed for large, complex institutions. As with any new  proposal, gathering the data, researching the required information for scenario analysis, and hiring  qualified experts can become financially burdensome. To comply with this framework would be  expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate current risk management practices. For example, with the  adoption of CECL, the bank must be even more concerned with reflecting future risk, such as the risk  that the climate will change, in loan loss reserves.  Troy Bank has helped customers through weather- related events since inception. When tornadoes, floods, and other severe weather issues have impacted  the communities we serve, we have responded to our customers' needs, worked with them through  their recovery period, and helped them to rebuild. These are not only our customers but our neighbors,  and they know that they can count on us due to our longstanding relationship. This differentiates  community banks from the large firms.  I thank you for limiting the proposal to banks with more than  $100 billion in assets and encourage the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to better  understand why this proposal should never apply to community banks.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment of its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of Tioga State Bank  N.A., a $560 million community bank located in Spencer, NY. Our bank has been operating in Upstate  New York since 1864 as a commercial bank providing residential, small business and agricultural loans in  our market. I am very concerned that the proposed framework for managing climate-related financial  risk management for large banks will trickle down and negatively impact community banks throughout  the country.  Our bank has been managing climate risk since 1864. We have weathered numerous  blizzards, ice storms, floods, and droughts in our 150+ year history. We experienced two 100-year floods  over the past sixteen years, one in 2006 and another in 2011 that devastated many homes and  businesses in our community, however the bank came through both events with little to no losses. We  also assisted many of our customers and provided zero interest and low interest rate loans to many to  help them through the recovery process. Having been in business through various climate cycles over  150 years shows evidence that we know how to manage and mitigate that risk.  To my knowledge there  has not been a bank failure due to climate change or even climate transition. Our country has gone  through many different transitions over the last 150 years that banks have certainly been able to  manage. Our banking system is extremely resilient and showed that during the recent Covid pandemic.  I  understand the transition risks as we try to move our country away from fossil fuels. However, I don't  anticipate the transition risk to be a major impact in our market. It is interesting that there continues to  be differing opinions about the move away from fossil fuels to renewable sources. The book, Unsettled  by Steven E. Koonin and a recent opinion article in the Wall Street Journal, Fossil Fuels' Forthright  Defender both provide differing opinions on our ability to affect climate change and transition away  from fossil fuels. Additionally, community banks have proven time and time again that we are nimble  and work with our customers and course correct as needed when wide-sweeping changes do occur.  The  proposal would require large banks to perform scenario analysis via computer modeling to determine  the future impact on the bank due to changes in the economy, financial system and or physical hazards  due to climate-related events. Truthfully, I find this modeling to be senseless. Scientists have not been  able to use computer modeling to recreate past weather events much less predict the future. There are  just too many variables.  We all know that regulations, including climate change risk management, tend  to trickle down to smaller banks as best practices. I am very concerned about the additional costs to  bring in so-called ""climate experts"" to help us manage this ""new"" risk. There will be many new climate  expert consultants who will make some significant money when this is implemented.  Requiring  community banks to gather climate data from our customers will also be problematic. Most of our small  business customers would have no idea of how to determine this data, much less be willing to collect 
and disclose the data to their bank.  It is concerning that this framework could discourage banks from  doing business with legal but climate disfavored industries. In the Northeast, most homes in our area are  heated with fuel oil. There are many small businesses that are tied into this industry, from fuel oil  dealers to furnace install and repair shops. If these businesses are shunned from the banking system,  who will step in to fill this role? This could lead to another ""Operation Chokepoint"" to target businesses  that may be out of favor with the administration and therefore, have a severe negative affect on rural  America and the many small communities and small businesses  I appreciate that the FDIC is giving us  the opportunity to weigh in on this important subject and hope you consider this in the implementation  of the proposed framework.

I am a 5th generation community  banker with my family founding BOM Bank in 1903 in Montgomery La. Since our humble beginnings in a  very poor, rural community of 800 people, our bank has been fortunate enough to grow to 17 locations  with over 700 million in total assets.  BOM Bank is a Certified Development Financial Institution (CDFI)  with 15 of our 17 locations located in Persistent Poverty Counties. We operate 15 locations in North and  Central La and 2 locations in Deep East Texas. We are proud to have broken ground on our 18th location  and this location will be in Pineville La in Rapides Parish, which is also a Persistent Poverty County.   Throughout the years of growth, we have never lost touch with who and what has made us the success  we are, that being the citizens of our communities.  I am very concerned that the FDIC will at some point  in the future impose the same climate-related policies on community banks. Over my 28 years at BOM  Bank, it always seems regulations that are imposed on the largest financial institutions invariably end up  being imposed on community banks at some point.  BOM Bank has been in business for 119 years and  during this time-period; we have not only survived but also thrived thru hurricanes, depressions,  recessions, Covid-19, bank-runs, mortgage meltdown and everything else that has happened over the  past century. We know how to underwrite loans and continue to help our communities thrive.  During  the Covid-19 Pandemic, BOM Bank participated in the Paycheck Protection Program and provided much  needed capital in the amount of approximately 165 million to approximately 2000 small businesses. We  provided loan deferrals, waived NSF fees, donated money to food banks, bought food for bank staff  bank-wide from local independently owned restaurants, partnered and volunteered hundreds of hours  with our local hospitals where Covid-19 shots were provided. These are just a small amount of what we  did during Covid-19 and shows that even during the worst pandemic in our nations history, we still  showed up to work, took care of our customers, non-customers and the community as a whole.

This is a topic that affects us  all, and as a community bank, it particularly affects us. I am the President of an $840 million community  bank located in St. Louis, MO. We served small businesses and predominantly focus on mom and pop  businesses looking to get started or expand their businesses. We work daily in our community serving  those who are chasing the ""American Dream"". Our clients aren't big business. They are not large  multinationals. They aren't faceless entities pushing their weight around to get their way. They are  normal Missourians, just looking to have a better life through entrepreneurship and hard work. At  almost 130 years old our institution has responded to, survived, and helped our community recover  from catastrophes and natural disasters. We are the stewards of our community and are best in a  position to see what is going on in our area. Overly burdensome, unnecessary, and speculative criteria  will not further protect our community. We are on the ground here and have been on the ground  helping to protect our community and the local ecosystems. I am worried about the proposed climate- related financial risk management applications on community banks. In our industry, there is always a  trickledown effect on regulations. Regulations tailored for and promised to only be applied to large  institutions, almost always eventually make their way down to the smallest institutions. These  community banks are least able to absorb further bureaucratic regulations. The proposed framework  will have an impact. It will strain our already very strained resources. Community banks do not have the  resources to stress test or analyze remote, highly speculative, or unquantifiable climate change  assumptions. Further, the mandatory climate change disclosure requirements would be burdensome, to  say the least. We do not have large-scale back-office teams to generate all of these things. Further,  these disclosures could easily be viewed as a way to penalize disfavored industries and become  politicized. While targeted incentives work, I fully support them. This sort of regulatory expansion based  on speculative assumptions does nothing positive for our industry or the climate. Before implementing  the proposal the Financial Stability Oversight Council in conjunction with the banking agencies should  conduct outreach meetings with community bankers. This would ensure proper perspective is received  and make sure it does not unfairly penalize or overburden community banks. I thank you for allowing  me the opportunity to send this letter. I do acknowledge and thank you for attempting to limit the  effects to banks over $100 billion. I ask you to please consider having outreach meetings with  community banks.

Bender emphasizes that community banks, like his, serve small businesses and are integral to local economies, having historically supported their communities through various challenges. He warns that the proposed regulations could strain resources, impose burdensome disclosure requirements, and potentially politicize the banking industry.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am writing regarding the FDIC's request for comment on its statement of principles for climate-related  financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the President and CEO of Union Bank Inc.,  a $375 million community bank located in Middlebourne, WV. We primarily provide consumer mortgage  loans, commercial real estate loans, and commercial / industrial loans to our rural northern WV markets.  I am concerned that the FDIC may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to  community banks. I believe that climate-focused risk-management framework for community banks is  unnecessary, for the following reasons: * Existing risk management practices are effective and have  enabled community banks to manage climate-related risk for many years. * Unlike large banks,  community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system and should not ever be subject to a  ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk management framework. * Compliance with a climate- related financial risk management framework would be expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate  current risk management practices.  My bank has been practicing climate-related risk management for  decades. For example: West Virginia, including our area, is prone to flash flooding. These natural events  have been occurring long before there was concern about climate-related weather events. We have  managed for this risk, and will continue to do so, by requiring flood insurance for property located in  flood-prone areas.  As to transitional risk (due to transition to a low-carbon economy), we have also  been managing this type of risk for decades. West Virginia has produced fossil fuels for over 100 years.  Community banks like mine, serving communities that are dependent upon these industries, have  managed through the significant volatility of the fossil fuel markets for many years. We are well aware  of, and plan for, this volatility.  Further, with the adoption of CECL, my bank and other community banks  will be required to consider future risks, such as potential climate-related risk, in our loan loss reserve  modeling.  The concept of Scenario Analysis, if required for community banks, is particularly troubling  and concerning. It should not be required of community banks, for the following reasons:  * Scenario  Analysis would require community banks to forecast for remote, isolated, and speculative risks and be of  little practical utility to community banks that are already familiar with their concentration risks and  how to manage these risks. * To conduct scenario analysis for transition risks, community banks would  need to gather climate data (such as greenhouse gas emissions data) from their customers, many of  which do not maintain this data nor would they have the resources to gather it.  The cost of scenario  analysis for community banks and their customers would be prohibitive, and would provide little if any  real benefit.  Again, with the requirement of CECL to provide a forward-looking analysis for loan loss  reserve adequacy, community banks like mine will already be practicing a type of scenario analysis.  My  bank, like nearly all community banks, is non-complex and of an overall lower risk profile than the  largest banks. There is no need to apply complex risk modeling such as Scenario Analysis to a community 
bank.  I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed framework. I encourage FDIC to  conduct outreach to community bankers in order to develop a better understanding as to why this  proposal should not, nor ever, apply to community banks.

Aiken emphasizes that community banks do not pose systemic risks and should not be subjected to a ""one-size-fits-all"" framework, which would be costly and redundant. He also criticizes the potential requirement for Scenario Analysis, stating it would be impractical and expensive for community banks, as it involves forecasting speculative risks and gathering data that many customers do not have. Aiken suggests that community banks already conduct forward-looking analyses through CECL requirements and urges the FDIC to engage with community bankers to understand their unique circumstances better."

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      To Whom It May Concern: This letter is written in regards to FDIC's request for comment on its  statement of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am  President and CEO of Vermilion Bank & Trust Company, which is a small community bank that opened  over 60 years ago. Our bank serves a diverse group of customers in the rural town of Kaplan as well as  other small communities in the surrounding area. Vermilion Bank has $160 million in assets and  primarily provides commercial and agricultural loans. I would like to express our opposition to this  Proposed Rule as it may, in the future, apply this climate-related financial risk management to  community banks which would negatively impact Vermilion Bank in addition to our community. I do  believe a separate risk-management framework for climate-related financial risk is unnecessary to  manage safety and soundness of any community bank with fewer than $100 billion in assets. Existing  risk management practices are effective and have enabled community banks to manage climate-related  risk for decades. Unlike large banks, community banks do not pose systemic risk to the financial system  and should not ever be subject to a ""one-size-fits-all"" climate-related financial risk management  framework designed for large, complex institutions. Compliance with a climate-related financial risk  management framework would be expensive and would unnecessarily duplicate current risk  management practices. Due to our location we have witnessed devastating hurricanes and the stress  this storms can have on our customers financially. We have always strived to help our community in  these times by allowing extensions on monthly loan payments, allowing them time to recoup in the  aftermath. Community banks are already familiar with their concentration risks and how to manage  these risks. With the adoption of CECL, our bank has implemented even more conservative approach to  reflecting future risks in loan loss reserve and stress testing the loan portfolio as part of CECL. Scenario  analysis is an expensive exercise that would require specialized third-party expertise, and it should not  be mandatory for community banks, given the small size, relative non-complexity and lower risk profile  of our community bank. Vermilion Bank is one of only four small community banks remaining in our  location. Losing a bank in our rural community due to regulatory burden would be a significant  detriment for local small businesses seeking access to credit. These businesses need greater access to  credit and not additional barriers. I would like to close by saying how much I appreciate your time, and  to thank you for the opportunity to express our concerns with this proposed rule. We are grateful for  FDICs limiting its proposal to banks with more than $100 billion in assets and would like to encourage  the FDIC to conduct outreach with community bankers to better understand why this proposal should  never apply to community banks.    Sincerely,    Joseph A Couvillon,   President and CEO, Vermilion Bank & Trust Co  Kaplan, LA","Joseph A.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary   Attention: Comments--RIN 3064-ZA32   Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   550 17th Street NW   Washington, DC 20429      Dear Mr. Sheesley:    I am taking the time to personally write you regarding the FDIC’s request for comment on its statement  of principles for climate-related financial risk management for large financial institutions. I am the  President of a small bank in the heart of the Coalfields of Southern West Virginia. Whitesville State Bank  was founded in 1946 and we just celebrated our 76th anniversary. We have a history of serving the coal  community and in a small way the coal industry. It is our way of life as well as the vast percentage of  economic opportunity for our citizens and thus, our bank. WSB is a $130 million dollar institution that  primarily serve consumers with Home Mortgage Loans, other consumer loans, and a small commercial  portfolio, all of which we keep on our books. We serve Boone, Raleigh, Wyoming, Fayette, and Kanawha  Counties with most of our customers living in distressed rural areas. In my 36 years as a community  banker, I have never seen the FDIC fine tune a regulation so that it does not affect small community  institutions and those effects are vastly more punitive to us. The cost us more via a myriad of negative  consequences that are an afterthought to the large institutions the regulations are written for. My  concerns are primarily outlined below:  • The continued spread of regulation and restrictions aimed at limiting GHG has already drastically  damaged our state’s economy. That impact will continue to increase negatively, and no consideration  will be given to the lives ruined in its wake. The regulation drops a bomb on our people, and they are  expected to simply move somewhere else. Their life’s work destroyed in the rear-view mirror.  • We currently manage climate related risk on an ongoing basis to ensure our services continue to flow  to our community, come what may. We plan, we test, and we implement common sense controls that  satisfy regulation and work.  • Unfortunately, we are too small to not fail. If we disappear tomorrow, it will be a blip on the FDIC’s  Insurance Funds radar. They won’t miss us, but this economy, this community, and this state, certainly  will if this death by 1,000 cuts continues.  • The expenses associated with this duplicative risk management will be very high for community banks.  We smother daily under the costs associated with the onslaught of compliance related expenses that  have poured out of D.C since the implementation of Dodd Frank. There will be a tipping point for us all  financially. Many have already tipped, as is evident by the sellout/burnout rate of community banks. It is  staggering and killing rural America.  • The personnel and expertise needed to run this new risk management process will be hard if not  impossible to find in rural America. We will struggle to train and fill the positions needed. That will only  add to the problems of BCP that all small banks face today.  WSB has navigated the rocky road of a commodity-based economy our entire existence. We plan for it  and we have weathered each storm that has come. We suffer with the people we serve and stand with 
them to make the best life possible for our citizens and state. It hasn’t always been pretty, but we adapt,  we plan, we mitigate, and we move on. I fear we are approaching a bridge to far from a regulatory  standpoint. We have been for years and continue to manage our climate related risks on a continuous  basis. We have been flooded twice over a 12-month period in the late 90’s at the main office in  Whitesville. We cleaned the catastrophe up ourselves and never closed a day or interrupted any  services. We have had blizzards, ice storms, derecho’s, power outages, and our mitigation strategies  have worked every time. We require flood insurance for customers, and we carry flood insurance for  ourselves where needed. All of what I have described was planned for, tested, mitigated, and retested  at great expense. Much more expense than the actual events caused us. The transitional risk that will  come from your new initiatives and the eventual continued decline the fossil fuel industry will  experience, will be hard to navigate. We however have been navigating this decline, whether market  driven, or regime change driven, for our entire 76 years of existence. This transitional future does not  look bright, but we will plan for it, survive it, and continue to serve whatever community we have left.  Further, with the adoption of CECL, my bank and other community banks will be required to consider  future risks, such as potential climate-related risk, in our loan loss reserve modeling. The concept of  Scenario Analysis, if required for community banks, is particularly troubling and concerning. WSB, like  nearly all community banks, is non-complex and of an overall lower risk profile than the largest banks.  There is no need to apply complex risk modeling such as Scenario Analysis to a community bank.  It should not be required of community banks, for the following reasons:  • Scenario Analysis would require community banks to forecast for remote, isolated, and speculative  risks and be of little practical utility to community banks that are already familiar with their  concentration risks and how to manage these risks.  • To conduct scenario analysis for transition risks, community banks would need to gather climate data  (such as greenhouse gas emissions data) from their customers, many of which do not maintain this data,  nor would they have the resources to gather it and will be furious that we ask for it    This expensive proposition would accomplish little and be impossible for small community banks to  absorb. The backlash to the process from our communities will cause reputational risk that will greatly  outweigh the new risk you are trying to measure. We continue to be told by our regulators what an  important role community banks play in our economy, society, and nation. Almost every agency I have  met with starts their presentation with those comforting words. Maybe it is possible to create banking  regulation that won’t trickle down to the bottom of the barrel where we are and drown us. My problem  is you haven’t been able to accomplish that in my 36-year career at WSB! I fully believe this flawed  initiative will be at my doorstep in short order if it is put into effect. If we are vital to our economies,  society, and nation, as we are told, then someone at the FDIC needs to hear and see what this will do to  the community banking industry!    Sincerely,    Robert L. Milam Jr.

As an industry advocate and long time  community banker and shareholder, I see numerous flaws in the proposals related to the financial risks  related to certain industries purportedly creating undue damage to our climate. We all have a vested  interest in a clean and safe environment. And, we mostly agree that the climate is changing as it has  since the earth was formed. Where we deviate from each other is the impact mankind is making in the  climate, which is an argument for the public forum, not within the financial regulation of banking  institutions.  If the public majority feels certain industries should be restrained, then by majority rule,  legislation and regulations should be focused direct on the industries. Trying to curtail these industries  through financial regulation imparts more political will than public opinion.  Banks, especially  community banks, do a great job of factoring in all known risks when evaluating the merits of a  transaction. Property insurance, including extended coverages, are almost always required. And all  sources of repayment are stressed to include risks related to issues such as weather events. Bankers are  trained to manage and mitigate risks, including climate related, which is all under the safety and  soundness reviews. Adding additional regulation for climate related risks create additional layers of  burden and will mostly cause the small and under-served markets to suffer the greatest from a  restriction of credit access. These entities typically do not have the resources to prove climate related  issues (i.e. - carbon footprints, etc.) are addressed.  I encourage the FDIC as well as the other prudential  financial regulators, to reconsider the climate-related proposals. While currently targeted at the  institutions over $100 billion, as with most legislation, the trickle down (or waterfall) will engulf  community banks, causing continued consolidation and continued reduction to credit access for most  small businesses.

Public gas systems focus on providing safe, reliable, affordable, and clean  energy to their customers and support their communities by delivering fuel to be used for  cooking, clothes drying, and space and water heating, as well as for various commercial and  industrial applications.    APGA supports goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.  As a cost-effective  and efficient energy source, consumers value the ability to choose natural gas as the solution  that works best for their budgets and lifestyles.  Given its growing domestic supply and the safe  and reliable delivery system reaching almost every home and business in America, the direct use  of natural gas in buildings is an important part of our country’s energy future.  In fact, natural gas  has been a big driver behind our country’s declines in carbon emissions. Notably, America’s gas    1 More information available at www.apga.org.

As FDIC works to develop its climate-related  risk principles for large financial institutions, APGA urges the agency to ensure that communities  who rely on these banks can continue to leverage public utilities, especially the workforce and  existing assets. The men and women, who work for APGA’s members, and the infrastructure they  operate provides natural gas now and lower carbon fuels in the future, which broadly support  the Administration's climate goals.      Many of our members rely on large financial institutions to lend money that is then used for  capital intensive projects, such as implementing new leak detection technology or repairing aging  infrastructure.  Any policy statement that may lead to higher costs for APGA members to borrow  money for these projects, which would help to lower emissions, could ultimately hurt the  consumer.  Because community-owned natural gas utilities operate as not-for-profits, costs are  directly passed to the end user, meaning that a policy statement that too broadly discriminates  against an industry large financial institutions do business with might actually result in higher  utility bills for consumers, even in communities working to minimize emissions. FDIC’s actions  could even lead to setbacks for our country’s decarbonization goals.  Accordingly, APGA  encourages FDIC to develop a policy that does not make broad sweeping assumptions that would  result in higher banking costs for publicly-owned gas utilities.  Misguided policies that put all our  energy “eggs in one basket” by mandating electrification are not helpful, as they eliminate  Americans’ ability to choose the energy source best fit for their needs and budget.      * * *    APGA members play a critical role in delivering Americans the safe, reliable, affordable,  and clean  energy they need.  Accordingly, FDIC’s climate principles should not hinder communities,  especially those who own and operate their own natural gas utility, from continuing to leverage  the existing natural gas distribution workers and fuel delivery infrastructure to meet the climate  goals of the current Administration.

Representing over 730 community-owned natural gas distribution entities, APGA emphasizes the importance of natural gas as a cost-effective, reliable, and clean energy source. They support greenhouse gas reduction goals but caution against policies that could increase borrowing costs for public utilities, potentially raising consumer utility bills and hindering decarbonization efforts. APGA urges the FDIC to avoid broad assumptions that could lead to higher banking costs for publicly-owned gas utilities, advocating for policies that allow communities to leverage existing natural gas infrastructure and workforce.

Sheesley  Attn: Comments – RIN 3064-ZA32  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429      Re:    Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions (RIN  3064ZA32)    Dear Mr. Sheesley,    On behalf of ANB Bank (ANB), thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) Statement of Principles for Climate Related Financial Risk Management  for Large Financial Institutions (RIN 3064ZA32).    ANB BANK BACKGROUND:    ANB is a $3.2 billion community bank headquartered in Denver, Colorado.  ANB consists of 29 locations  in the United States, specifically in Colorado and Wyoming.  The bank serves a number of distinct and  diverse communities, ranging from large metropolitan cities in Colorado, to rural communities in  Wyoming and western Colorado, to high-cost resort communities in Colorado.   As a community bank,  ANB strives to meet the diverse borrowing needs of our customers in each unique community we serve,  offering a wide range of lending solutions from mortgage and small business loans to commercial real  estate and agriculture loans.  We also provide energy financing, focused on traditional oil and gas  production as well as renewable energy.      ANB BANK RISK MANAGEMENT:    ANB intentionally maintains a low to moderate risk profile, and our risk management practices closely  align with our commitment to serving our customers and communities.  We have developed risk  strategies, policies, procedures, and limits to monitor and manage all lending risks.  Our localized  presence in the communities we serve helps us understand and anticipate risks that large, national  organizations without a local presence may not envision.  These risks include those related to weather  or climate and indirect climate-change risks due to regulatory change or changes in consumer  preferences.       RECOMMENDATIONS:    ANB recognizes the importance of adequately preparing for the potential impact of climate change and  the transition to a low carbon economy.  As such, the bank is supportive of the FDIC’s Principles for  
      Climate Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions and offers two primary recommendations:    A) Maintain the proposed asset size threshold of $100 Billion and formally recognize that smaller  institutions with localized knowledge of their markets adequately manage climate-related risk  through existing risk-management frameworks.      B) Consider the potential for unintended consequences in both design and implementation, and  provide additional guidance to mitigate unintended impacts to communities, industry sectors,  and the economy as a whole.     $100 Billion Asset Size Threshold    Community banks have a different level of climate risk when compared to the largest financial  institutions with a national presence.  For community banks, climate risk is more localized and  understandable.  Serving local communities allows community/regional banks to directly manage  localized climate risks without applying a ""one-size-fits-all"" risk management framework.      As an example, ANB has developed policies and procedures to manage the physical risk of weather and  climate events.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and forest fires present the highest risk to our  borrowers and their property within our footprint.  As a result, the bank has implemented detailed  property and collateral insurance procedures to ensure loans are sufficiently insured before originating  and throughout the life of the loan.  This direct approach to risk management allows the bank to be  more specific in helping to protect our borrower's property against weather or climate risks.    Like the bank's risk mitigation practices on an individual loan level, the bank's overall credit risk  governance framework is proven, well thought out, and designed to maintain a low-to-moderate risk  profile.  This framework includes (1) a quarterly Allowance for Loan Loss Reserves analysis which  incorporates local economic, industry sector, and real estate market analysis, (2) a quarterly liquidity  analysis, (3) a semi-annual loan portfolio concentration analysis, and (4) numerous monthly loan reports  presented to the bank's Board of Directors.  The requirement to complete similar reports and analyses  specifically for climate risks would be burdensome and result in duplication of risk analysis and  mitigation efforts.            While all financial institutions have climate-related risks, the proposed principles must recognize that  community banks have comprehensive risk-management practices that incorporate ""on-the-ground""  knowledge of local markets and address many potential risk factors, including those associated with  climate change.   As such, ANB strongly recommends that the FDIC maintain the proposed asset size  threshold of $100 billion and encourages the FDIC to incorporate language in the principles that  properly recognizes the localized risk management strategies of community banks and diminishes the  temptation to reduce this threshold over time.     Consider Unintended Consequences    The statement of principles must consider the potential for unintended consequences.  Any regulatory  directives related to climate-risk management must be thoughtful in both design and implementation in  order to avoid unintended consequences, such as limiting credit availability to “dis-favored” industries.      For example, if an outcome of the statement of principles is a significant reduction in the availability of  credit to the oil and gas industry, there will be severe follow-on effects to local communities and related  industries (such as agriculture) that are dependent on the oil and gas industry.   Smaller, rural 
    communities served by community banks such as ANB will suffer the greatest economic harm and often  have the least resources to cope.  Community banks can, and will, be a lifeline for many but many rural  communities are already “banking deserts” due to consolidation.  Negatively impacting industries like oil  and gas or agriculture will make this problem much worse, leaving many communities stranded  financially at a time of great need.    Additionally, the needs of a community are defined by their location and local industries that have  evolved over many years.  These needs are not by choice and not easy to change.  Community banks like  ANB are committed to meeting the needs of their local communities, even when those needs are  unpopular with Washington politicians and regulators.   To the extent that the statement of principles  becomes an “unofficial” examiner expectation for smaller banks, the ability of community banks like  ANB to serve our communities will be limited.      Unintended consequences such as those noted above may result in both localized and systemic risks  that are not easily predicted or mitigated.  ANB strongly encourages the FDIC to incorporate language in  the principles that (1) discourages financial institutions from taking actions that would result in  unintended consequences such as reduced credit availability to specific industry sectors, and (2)  discourages examiners from unofficially applying these expectations to smaller institutions.    CONCLUSION    In conclusion, ANB recognizes the importance of these risk management principles for large Systemically  Important Financial Institutions.  However, expanding these requirements to smaller financial  institutions would be burdensome, duplicative, and unnecessary.       Additionally, unintended consequences must be avoided.  While climate change is a source of risk that  must be managed, withdrawing support for disfavored industries would likely have significant and  harmful downstream impacts to local communities as well as the community banks committed to  serving those communities.  The statement of principles must thoughtfully consider potential  unintended consequences.     On behalf of ANB, thank you again for the opportunity to provide input on this rulemaking, and we  would welcome the opportunity to discuss these comments further.  If you have any questions or would  like clarification regarding anything contained in our comments, please don't hesitate to contact me at  303-394-5045 or via email at shawn.harrison@anbank.com    Sincerely,     Shawn Harrison  First Senior Vice President  Senior Credit Officer","ANB Bank, a $3.2 billion community bank, responds to the FDIC's climate risk management principles for large financial institutions.

Sheesley, Assistant Executive Secretary  Comments—RIN 3064–ZA32  550 17th Street NW  Washington, DC 20429    Submitted via https://www.fdic.gov/resources/regulations/federal-register- publications/index.html and Email to: comments@fdic.gov    Re: Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32)    Dear Sir:    My name is Lucinda Mahoney and I am the Revenue Commissioner for the State of  Alaska. I respectfully submit the following comments in response to the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)’s Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk  Management for Large Financial Institutions (“Proposed Principles”).1 My comments mostly  focus on the impact that the proposed principles will have to the State of Alaska. I also support  the positions identified in a memo, that I have signed, that was submitted by the State Finance  Officers Foundation on this same topic.    I request that the FDIC not adopt the Proposed Principles due to harm that the proposed  principles will have on Alaska’s economy, its indigenous people, including its Native and  Village Corporations, indigenous village infrastructure, Alaskan roads, bridges, non-profits and  the health and education of all Alaskans.    If this proposal is enacted, banks would be encouraged to exclude needed capital in areas  of our Alaskan economy.  By singling out climate-related risk for special caution in the provision  of credit, the Proposed Principles would prompt banks to deny credit, or offer credit on worse  terms, to businesses that might conduct business in Alaska. Not only will these actions harm the  Alaskan economy and its indigenous people, but it will harm our nation’s ability to become  energy independent and create global reliance on energy sources from countries where the  carbon emissions are significantly worse than energy produced in Alaska.     A reduction in access to affordable capital in our state will have a negative impact on our  economy, State of Alaska general fund revenues and all its residents. Alaska is unique state    1 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Notice of Proposed Policy Statement; Request For Comment. 2021-62  (April 4, 2022), Statement of Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial  Institutions (RIN 3064–ZA32), Federal Register Vol. 87, No. 64, https://www.fdic.gov/news/board- matters/2022/2022-03-29-notational-fr.pdf.    
    2 whereby oil and gas taxes, royalties and investment earnings from fossil fuel developments and  mining developments fund up to 90% of tax and investment revenues. The fossil fuel industry  and other natural resource development is the foundation of Alaska’s economy providing jobs  and community sustainability. Fossil fuel revenues provide Alaskan communities with funds for  programs that include education, health, public safety, roads, bridges, power cost equalization for  rural communities, water & sewer infrastructure in rural Alaska, and natural resources and  environmental management.     The history, as well as the congressional intent behind the Alaska Statehood Act is clear;   as the only state that retains ownership interest in subsurface mineral rights, our becoming a state  was conditioned upon supporting all these vital public services with resource revenues.   Congressional intent for Alaska to responsibly develop our resources is so deeply embedded in  statehood that the Act contains a revisionary clause that if Alaska sold the resources in the  ground, the land in question would revert to the federal government.    Currently, Alaska’s indigenous people significantly benefit from the fossil fuel  developments in our state. In addition to the revenues that State government shares with the  villages to fund education, health, and infrastructure as mentioned above, many local village  communities receive significant direct tax revenue in the form of sales taxes and property taxes  generated mostly from fossil fuel investments. The Alaska Native Regional Corporations share  70% of resource revenues among all the 13 corporations (ANSCA 7i) which split it between  village corporations and shareholders. Over $3 billion was shared between 1982 to 2015.The  money is often used for cultural education, language revitalization, and scholarships, or is paid  directly in shareholder dividends, but the individual corporations ultimately determine how it is  spent.    Additionally, the State of Alaska funds education programs to train indigenous people for  high paying jobs in the oil and gas sector. Local hire preferences are in place and help to build  resilient Native and remote communities. Several of Alaska Native Regional Corporations have  established oil and gas service companies to support the oil and gas industry in Alaska as well as  the lower 48 states. In addition to providing jobs for its indigenous people, the native  corporations also use their revenues to improve the quality of life and economic well-being of  their shareholders. The native corporations share the profits with its shareholders in the form of a  dividend. These dividends are mostly used to procure basic needs such as food, housing, and  transportation. Alaska’s indigenous populations enjoy financial support that lower-48 indigenous  peoples do not in the form of native and village corporations – thanks in large part to responsible  resource development.    Discrimination in financial services in Alaska hurts minority communities of Alaska  Natives and their ability to develop land they received as part of a settlement for their aboriginal  rights.  As mentioned above, many of the companies that provide goods and services to the oil  and gas industry on Alaska’s North Slope employ Alaska Natives or are owned and operated by  Alaska Native Corporations whose shareholders are Alaska Natives.  These service companies  rely on their ability to use the financial services of a bank to finance equipment or obtain a line  of credit for their business operations. These Proposed Principles would require a bank to assess  whether providing these typical bank services to companies engaged in the oil and gas industry 
    3 or which are in the Arctic pose a climate-related financial risk.  In actuality, the proposal could  lead to the “red lining” of the Arctic in Alaska and its Native inhabitants, widening the disparities  and disadvantaging our first peoples.    As a result of responsible fossil fuel developments some of the local village governments  have been able to save portions of its fossil fuel revenues and have formed reserve funds to  preserve wealth and ensure sustainable communities for future generations. Also, according to  the American Medical Association, Alaskan’s life expectancy rose along with oil and gas  development during 1980-2014. Lifespans increased 4-16 years with the highest increase in the  indigenous people that live in the North Slope Borough, which is the area of significant oil and  gas development. The funds provided by the fossil fuel revenues to this village likely assisted in  improved healthcare and access to telemedicine.    As nations across the globe strive to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas, some may be  forced to acquire energy from areas of the globe that do not have the strict environmental  standards that are in place in Alaska. Alaska has comprehensive and rigorous environmental  permitting, monitoring and compliance programs in place that focus on sustaining human health,  reducing carbon emissions and our ecosystem. For many years. Alaska law has prevented the  flaring of natural gas during the production of oil. This prohibition significantly reduces  greenhouse emissions associated with oil production. Alaska is a longtime leader in categories  measured under ESG metrics and ranks lowest among all energy producing states in our nation.     Alaska has already embraced Energy Transition and has funded renewable energy  solutions throughout the state enabling 30% of our power to currently come from renewable  solutions. Alaska also has the highest amount of acreage committed to carbon offsets in the  nation. We value our environment and know how to properly balance with fossil fuel  developments.  CONCLUSION    The Proposed Principles favor and elevate social and political issues to the detriment of  Alaska, our businesses, our indigenous people, and all our Alaskan residents.  Alaska can be part  of the global climate change solution with a significant amount of oil and gas reserves waiting to  be developed. Our reserves are developed in a responsible sustainable manner that will assist the  world as we transition to renewable energy sources. However, a reduction to access to affordable  capital now will reduce the likelihood of development and will result in a world that will be  forced to rely on higher carbon emissions production.     Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. If you have any questions, please  contact me at Alaska Department of Revenue.   Respectfully submitted,  Lucinda Mahoney  Commissioner, Alaska Department of Revenue","Lucinda Mahoney, Revenue Commissioner for Alaska, opposes the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management principles for large financial institutions. She argues that these principles would harm Alaska's economy, indigenous communities, and infrastructure by discouraging banks from providing necessary capital. Mahoney emphasizes that Alaska's economy heavily relies on fossil fuel revenues, which fund essential services like education, health, and infrastructure. She highlights the benefits that indigenous communities receive from fossil fuel developments, including jobs, tax revenues, and dividends. Mahoney warns that the proposal could lead to financial discrimination against Alaska Natives and hinder their economic development. She also notes that Alaska has rigorous environmental standards and is a leader in renewable energy, arguing that the state can contribute to global climate solutions without the proposed restrictions. Mahoney concludes that the principles prioritize social and political issues over Alaska's economic and social well-being, potentially increasing global reliance on higher-emission energy sources."

The author argues that business purposes should be privately determined and not influenced by corporate social responsibility or environmental, social, and governance criteria.

The comment criticizes the Biden Administration's efforts to combat climate change through financial regulation, claiming it will increase costs, reduce competition, and harm the economy without significantly impacting climate change. The author suggests that companies should assess their own risks without government mandates and that regulatory agencies should not have excessive discretion in imposing climate-related regulations."

Grand Savings Bank is a  market leader in Delaware County, Oklahoma and operates thirteen branches located in  Northeast Oklahoma and Northwest Arkansas. Grand Savings Bank is a $780 million  Community Bank that has served its communities for over 30 years and has provided continuity  to operations and customer service through our risk management policies and practices.  Climate related risks are events that we prepare for on a continual basis with contingency  backup plans to serve our communities in the aftermath of any event. I am the CEO of Grand  Savings Bank and feel that the proposed framework for managing climate related financial risk  management for large banks will negatively impact our bank and our community since such  rules will be applied to Community Banks at some point in time. Community Bankers have been  monitoring risks for years which includes the climate element within the risk profile; however,  creating a new initiative with political overtones does not serve a community bank with  additional expense and bureaucracy when such risk is already monitored.  Please consider our response to item D Current Risk Management Practices and questions 5- 10: In our community bank, we may be faced with hiring qualified experts to perform scenario  analysis as there are few individuals located in our community who could perform this work.  The burden on our staff and customers to gather climate data could be overwhelming to  complete the analysis. Banks of all sizes will continue to apply traditional credit and financial  risk tolerances and parameters to their balance sheets to manage their risks and support the  customers and communities they serve.  In addition, banks are navigating enterprise risk management, third party risk management and  assessments, information technology risk and cybersecurity risk which are addressed at least  annually and more frequently as changes in processes dictate. These are areas that  community banks need to focus on.  I would like to thank the FDIC for the opportunity to submit comments on the proposed  framework. Community Banks support working America in our local communities and we would  like to discourage creating new bureaucracy that repackages our current risk profiles and  monitoring for the sake of being popular with the current bun word of ""Climate"".","The CEO of Grand Savings Bank, a community bank in Oklahoma and Arkansas, responds to the FDIC's proposed climate-related financial risk management framework.

The bank already incorporates climate risks into its risk management practices and views the new initiative as unnecessary and politically motivated. The CEO expresses concern about the potential need to hire experts for scenario analysis, which could be burdensome for staff and customers. The bank emphasizes its focus on traditional risk management areas, such as credit, financial, enterprise, third-party, IT, and cybersecurity risks. The CEO urges the FDIC to avoid creating additional bureaucracy that could hinder community banks, which play a crucial role in supporting local communities."
